patients may feel emotionally unprepared for treatment due to a lack of understanding and/or belief in art , leading to increased difficulties with everyday treatment management.1617 identifying and understanding the difficulties that arise in the beginning of treatment may help prevent further episodes of non - adherence and potentially increase long - term adherence with sustainable clinical benefits and improvement in patient quality of life.16,17 the present study aimed to describe the degree of difficulty with art reported by hiv - infected patients in public aids reference centers using two cross - sectional analyses issued subsequent to the beginning of treatment ( after one and seven months ) .
finally , the association of a higher cd4 + cell count and the asymptomatic patient designation ( cdc classification a ) with increased difficulties may reflect a lower perception of these patients with regard to the need for treatment , and thus a lower threshold for dealing with the daily burden of art regimens . findings from these analyses suggest the need for early assessment of factors associated with increased difficulties and therefore the need to identify patients who are at a greater risk of lower adherence before starting treatment .
