it has been found that both bupivacaine and lignocaine have their merits and demerits but beyond any doubt it has been proven by the clinical trials that bupivacaine provides better and prolonged analgesia and anesthesia post operatively during minor surgical procedures done at chair side along with surgical removal of impacted third molars .
hence , bupivacaine can be regularly used as the anaesthetic solution along with adrenaline 1:200,000 for surgical removal of impacted third molars provided care being taken regarding the dosage and the cardiodepressant property of bupivacaine . right now , further studies are going on .
topical lidocaine has been shown in some patients to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia ( a complication of shingles ) , though not enough study evidence exists to recommend it as a first - line treatment .
lidocaine is also the most important class-1b antiarrhythmic drug ; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias ( for acute myocardial infarction , digoxin poisoning , cardioversion , or cardiac catheterization ) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated .
although not completely curing the disorder , it has been shown to reduce the effects by around two - thirds .
