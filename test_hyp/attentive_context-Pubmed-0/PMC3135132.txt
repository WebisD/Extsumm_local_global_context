the aim of our study was to examine , in detail , the influence of 24-epi , a br present in vicia faba , on mpp - induced oxidative stress in a well - known model of pd , nerve growth factor- ( ngf- ) differentiated pc12 cells   .
overall , our findings clearly demonstrate that 24-epi is a new , efficient , protective molecule against mpp - induced oxidative stress and might thus be regarded as a novel agent in complementary and/or preventive therapies of neurodegenerative diseases .
in particular , we studied pc12 cells , a known , reliable , and efficient model for the investigation of oxidative stress and neuroprotection of da neurons   .
figures 5(a)5(c ) , illustrating sod , cat , and gpx activities , respectively , reveal that the exposure of neuronal pc12 cells to mpp for 3  h significantly increased the levels of these 3 antioxidant enzymes , corroborating a cell stress response to mpp - induced ros production . at 15  h ,
. however , l - dopa concentrations in vicia faba are not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the responses observed in pd patients and raise the possibility that other compounds from vicia faba , such as brs , may complement the l - dopa effect by their antioxidative activities .
