we have successfully synthesized poly(nipaam)-pluronic surfactants by polymerizing nipaam from the ends of hydroxyl groups of pluronic f68 using can and also demonstrated the reduction in the initial burst release of the drug from the plga microparticles prepared using the poly(nipaam)-pluronic surfactants .
the ultimate goal of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of the poly(nipaam)-pluronic copolymer as a surfactant and demonstrate its application for a controlled drug delivery .
the rationale for our approach is as follows : at room temperature ( below the lcst ) , plga microparticles prepared using poly(nipaam)-pluronic surfactants exhibit appropriate colloidal stability due to the hairy structure of poly(nipaam ) at the surface of the microparticles . when the plga microparticles are injected into the human body , the poly(nipaam ) block shrinks and forms a hydrophobic layer at the surface of the microparticles , eventually resulting in the sustained release of the drug .
