is a more accurate method of dividing the liver parenchyma along the intersubsegmental and intersegmental demarcation to facilitate more precise anatomical s8vent resection .
the current authors have proposed a method of identifying the intersegmental and intersubsegmental border inside the liver to facilitate more precise anatomical subsegmentectomy .
since couinaud 's segment viii is the largest segment of the liver and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) often have impaired liver function , reduced anatomical resection of the ventral part of segment viii ( s8vent ) has been used as an alternative to full anatomical resection of segment viii in its entirety in actual clinical settings .
anatomical s8vent resection is technically demanding , and previously reported techniques for anatomical resection are not without their drawbacks . proposed here
a tributary of the mhv ( v8 - 5i ) was found to be running on the segment border of s8vent and s5vent in three - dimensional images and it was detected and exposed during transection .
the landmark vein of v8 - 5i in the transverse s8s5 intersegmental plane was determined for the first time since it had not been described in the literature . in recent practice , these subsegmental venous tributaries have been exposed as they are in anatomical studies .
