this study evaluated in situ the corrosion of the metallic components 
 of haas expanders by stereomicroscopy , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and energy 
 dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) .
under the conditions evaluated in this randomized clinical study , it may be concluded 
 that there were color change and peaks of chemical elements suggestive of corrosion in 
 all specimens of both groups in the soldering point areas between the wire , silver 
 brazing and bands of the haas expanders , with no difference between the groups .
the children were 
 randomly assigned to two groups of 17 individuals each ( groups i and ii ) .
