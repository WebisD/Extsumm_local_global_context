our objective was to identify the anesthetic considerations in techniques of hepatic vascular control methods .
special attention should also be paid to the preoperative assessment and induction of anesthesia , as patients undergoing liver resection usually have a compromised health status .
although liver resections have been associated with high mortality and morbidity rates , recent advances in anesthetic and surgical management have significantly reduced the operative risk .
intolerance to thve is not unusual and this method should be reserved for patients in need for extensive reconstruction of the inferior vena cava .
all prospective randomized studies were thoroughly evaluated and presented , as they are the most important source of information on the outcomes of surgical and anesthetic manipulations .
every method of hepatic vascular control applied under a carefully selected anesthetic plan can improve the outcome of patients undergoing hepatectomy .
when performing these techniques , the conduct of anesthesia should take into account hemodynamic management , risks of vascular air embolism , ischemia reperfusion liver injury , intraoperative blood loss , and the need for transfusion , factors which usually complicate hepatic vascular control methods .
anesthetic vigilance along with thorough knowledge of the surgical manipulations promotes team - based health care in the operative room .
