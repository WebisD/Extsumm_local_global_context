although spinal cord abnormalities in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) have been infrequently reported in the literature , myelitis is a known complication of aids and is occasionally the initial complaint
the likelihood of diagnosis increases if serum titers for toxoplasma antibodies are positive or where the initiation of early treatment with empiric anti - toxoplasmosis therapy and steroids improves both the patient s clinical and radiographic manifestations .
since 1986 , 18 cases of apparent toxoplasmosis of the spinal cord have been described   .
a review of existing literature suggests that although toxoplasmic myelitis is uncommon , it should be suspected in immunocompromised patients who present with symptoms of acute or sub - acute myelopathy .
a case report and pertinent literature were reviewed , leading to the diagnosis and management options discussed below .
although spinal cord toxoplasmosis is uncommon , it has been suggested that most patients with aids that present with evolving myelopathy , characterized by extremity weakness , sensory involvement , spinal cord enlargement , and enhancing lesions in brain or spinal cord ct or mri , have toxoplasmic myelitis   .
the optimal dosage and period of treatment for spinal cord lesions must be addressed in future studies . in this case , the brain and spinal cord lesions were found in an hiv - positive man who had not previously been diagnosed .
