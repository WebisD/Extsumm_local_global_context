we present the new technique of trabecular metal acetabular revision system ( tmars ) cup - cage construct to accomplish the massive acetabular bone defect in our case .
the management of an infected thr with a bone defect is almost always an arduous mission to the treating surgeon .
the crucial determinants in selection of a surgical procedure are the remnant bone stock and the nature of defect .
thus , the cup - cage construct may mitigate the need of allografts for reconstruction of acetabulum in future.21
we resorted to two stage procedure is the gold standard of care with promising results to affray infection.13 comparable results have been proclaimed even with single stage revision.45 we resorted to two stage procedure due to non availability of special incubation techniques for impregnation of antibiotics into the allograft and lack of clinical experience with the same .
the option of allograft prosthesis for the proximal femoral defect was straightforward and driven by the evidence in literature.67 anatomic restoration of the hip center and stability are the prime factors which govern the outcome in any hip replacement surgery .
the number of primary hip arthroplasties performed in the younger age patients escalates the demand for revision procedures .
