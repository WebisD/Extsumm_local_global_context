therefore , the present report introduces and evaluates the clinical results of a procedure that expands the ridge in a stepwise technique using screws of gradually increasing width .
one case involving implant placement in the maxillary anterior area developed a complication of failed osseointegration .
buccal cortical bone fracture did not occur in any of the cases . even after the prosthesis were functioning , all adjacent alveolar bones and soft tissues remained stable .
methods augmenting the alveolar bone to the buccolingual side are often done because ridge splitting involving the use of an osteotome and mallet can induce greenstick fractures of the buccal cortical bone . in the ridge splitting procedure ,
discomfort to patients is often substantial because of malleting , and there is a risk of buccolingual bone fracture when excessive force is delivered .
one year after functional loading , good results without the gingival recession or alveolar bone resorption were obtained . in a case with poor d4 bone quality ,
b-1007 - 105 - 106 ) . in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery ,
are the following : narrow implant placement , horizontal veneer block bone graft , horizontal guided bone regeneration ( gbr ) , and the ridge splitting procedure1,2,3 .
