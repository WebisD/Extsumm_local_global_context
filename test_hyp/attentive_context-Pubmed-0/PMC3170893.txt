herein , we describe our technique in establishing single port access for cholecystectomy in five patients that involves the use of a 2  mm in diameter grasper , karl storz 27290f , that is generally used by urologists for percutaneous nephrolithiasis intervention .
single incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) for cholecystectomy procedure has been introduced as early as 1999   to achieve less pain , less scarring , and less hospitalization period .
the use of transabdominal 20 nylon sutures attached to keith needles   and the use of a kirschner wire hook introduced through subcostal area   are reported methods used for traction of gallbladder and better exposition of the calot triangle .
after induction of general anesthesia , an umbilical skin incision , 1.5  cm in length , is made vertically and a covidien sils port having 5  mm12  mm four holes is inserted to the peritoneal cavity under direct vision and pneumoperitoneum is created .
we believe learning curve would be low and it would be possible to significantly decline operation periods in following patients . in conclusion , with the help of this instrument the operation period may be lessened , less scarring is achieved and surgical procedure is done more easily and safely without any additional costs .
