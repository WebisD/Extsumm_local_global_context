, the present study demonstrated that implementation of the cpets , which was developed in accordance with international standard five - level per triage practices , results in a shunting of nonemergency patients to outpatient care ( thereby reducing per patient flow ) , improves triage accuracy , reduces wait times , especially for critical patients for whom reduced delays amount to a better rescue success rate , and improves the satisfaction of the patients parents .
the patients visited to per in control group and cpets group were similar in terms of gender ratio (  = 0.004 , p > 0.05 ) and age ( t = 0.590 , p > 0.05 ) .
all patients who visited our per in a 6-month period before ( january 2013june 2013 ) and a 6-month period after ( january 2014june 2014 ) implementation of the newly developed cpets served as the control group and experimental cpets group , respectively .
highly significant ( t = 11.27 , p < 0.001 ) ; significant comparison outcomes demonstrated reduced waiting times for care in the per in the cpets group relative to the control group , both overall and for severe ( level 1 or 2 ) patients ( z = 2.057 , p = 0.040 ) .
