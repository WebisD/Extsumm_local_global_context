the immigrants attending the clinic came from all over the world , had similar diagnoses , and were attending the clinic as often per annum as the nonimmigrants .
in the hope of optimizing the service of immigrants in a health care centre , in a rapidly changing society , we have tried to integrate knowledge on cultural aspects into the services as well as providing interpreters as needed .
the health and health care utilization of immigrants did not differ from those of the nonimmigrants .
of the immigrants , 26 women were married , 9 cohabiting , and 12 single , compared to 11 married , 24 cohabiting , and 13 single in the group of nonimmigrants . of the women living in permanent relationships ,
, the immigrants attended the clinic with their children equally often as the controls , 6.9 versus 6.6 times , p = 0.76 ( table 2 ) .
interpreters were used in 12 ( 21% ) of the 57 consultations . when asked about the quality and satisfaction with the interpreter service ,
being married compared to cohabiting was more common in the immigrant group , p < 0.001 .
the mean age of the participants was 34.0 years in the immigrant group and 33.7 years in the nonimmigrant group , p = 0.664 .
