it is noninvasive , has few side effects , and is available in many centers internationally   . in the current paper , we first describe the pathophysiology of acromegaly , the existing surgical and medical treatments , and then introduce radiosurgical methods . in particular , we will focus on gamma knife radiosurgery ( gks ) since it has a broader base of supporting literature than alternative forms of stereotactic radiosurgery .
while surgical resection remains the first line of treatment , stereotactic radiosurgery is proving itself a feasible alternative therapy ( when surgery might be contraindicated ) and adjunct ( when surgical resection is unsuccessful in leading to complete disease remission ) .
these treatments are not universally effective for patients and are sometimes contraindicated . as an adjunct treatment , and sometimes as an alternative treatment , radiosurgery has proven to be an attractive therapy .
acromegaly is serious endocrinological derangement which , left untreated , reduces life expectancy and results in physiological derangements and complications that may negatively affect a patient 's quality of life .
finally , the overall efficacy of gks is described , along with its reported morbidities .
ultimately , further studies are needed to delineate which patients are most likely to receive benefit from gks , along with ways to improve gks outcomes .
