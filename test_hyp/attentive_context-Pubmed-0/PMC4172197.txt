there have been reports of multidrug - resistant strains of gram - negative bacteria being isolated from patients with endophthalmitis.4 endophthalmitis caused by klebsiella pneumoniae is associated with generally poor visual outcomes , despite treatment with appropriate antibiotics.5 three cases of acute postoperative endophthalmitis due to multidrug - resistant k. pneumoniae are reported .
three patients developed acute - onset endophthalmitis within 13 days following cataract surgery ( table 1 ) .
gram - negative organisms have been isolated in 26%42% of patients with cataract surgery related to endophthalmitis in developing countries,1,2 as compared with 5.9%11.8% in developed countries.3 the more common gram - negative organisms causing endophthalmitis include species of pseudomonas , haemophilus , proteus , and klebsiella .
the outcome of patients in the current case series was either phthisis or blindness , even after the best possible treatment .
hypopyon was observed in all patients and corneal infiltrate was observed in two patients who presented with visual acuity of light perception .
acute - onset postoperative endophthalmitis is characterized by marked inflammation of intraocular fluids and tissues .
it is stable to hydrolysis by the common plasmid - mediated -lactamases produced by various bacteria and lacks cross - resistance with penicillins and third - generation cephalosporins.11 one case series reported use of intravitreal imipenem in the treatment of endophthalmitis caused by acinetobacter baumannii .
