plica neuropathica is an acquired , rare condition characterized by sudden and irreversible matting of scalp hair in otherwise healthy individuals .
it was formerly supposed to be a disease peculiar to poles ( hence named as plica polonica ) and was usually the result of neglect or parasitic infestations .
we consider that matting of hair is not truly a hair disorder , rather a reaction resulting from the interplay of great motley of factors . moreover , the role of myriad factors such as chronic illness , hospital stay , pancytopenia , and drug induced cuticular damage is still debatable .
subsequently , other factors such as shampoos , conditioners , herbal soaps , and psychiatric morbidity were also reported to result in matting of scalp hair .
a dermatology consult was sought for a 65-year - old female who developed severe matting of scalp hair for 1 week .
the current report is probably only the third case of plica neuropathica associated with azathioprine - induced pancytopenia and first with methotrexate in literature and unusual in that it occurred not because of neglect and poor hair care or overzealous shampooing of hair but due to cuticular damage of hair shaft secondary to the immunosuppressive drug induced pancytopenia .
