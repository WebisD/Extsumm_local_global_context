aneuploid strains were generated by sporulation of the above polyploid strains , followed by karyotype stability tests and determination as described in fig .

qpcr assays were designed with primers in non - coding regions on each chromosome arm ( supplementary table 1 lists primer sequences ) .
omnitrays representing three biological replicates of each tested condition were scanned on an hp scanjet 4070 desktop scanner .
the ms / ms datasets were searched using sequest23 against a database of 11,986 sequences , consisting of 5,816 s. cerevisiae non - redundant proteins ( ncbi ) , 177 contaminants and 5,993 decoy sequences .
whole - cell lysates were prepared from 50 ml cycling yeast cultures by bead - beating .
equal amounts ( od600 ) of aneuploid and euploid control cultures were spotted , using the biomek fx robot , onto omnitrays containing various solid media and grown under conditions listed in supplementary table 2 .
dna samples were prepared by alkaline lysis , and qpcr reactions were performed in 384-well plates using a biomek fx ( beckman coulter ) to assemble 10 l reactions and an abi 7900ht ( applied biosystems ) for cycling .
