sirt1 also may exert antidiabetic effects via the modulation of insulin secretion and improvement of insulin resistance via its regulatory effects on insulin signaling , inflammation , mitochondrial function , and circadian rhythms .
over the last decade , our understanding of sirt1 has expanded from its initial characterization as a single nad - dependent class iii histone deacetylase that is responsible for longevity in yeast and which is associated with cr .
specifically , it has been found that sirt1 deacetylates not only histones but also many transcriptional regulators and proteins , thereby modulating diverse biological processes .
thus , cr has a variety of beneficial effects with respect to lifespan extension and delays the onset of age - related diseases , such as cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative disorders , and diabetes .
therefore , the development of improved additional treatments and novel prevention strategies for t2 dm is a matter of great urgency . aging is implicated in metabolic diseases , including diabetes ; therefore , aging is recognized as a risk factor for the initiation and the development of t2 dm .
long - term diabetes results in vascular changes and dysfunction , and diabetic vascular complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes .
