however , in a number of chromosomes corresponding to 308  s and g2 cells , treated simultaneously with the chromosome - breaking agent bleomycin and the base analog edu , not a single chromosome showed a labeling pattern indicative of bir . in budding yeast , more than half of diploid cells repair ho - endonuclease - induced dsbs by bir using the homologous chromosome as template ( bosco and haber , 1998 ) ; meaning more than half of the dsbs
had bir occurred with a similar efficiency in the field bean , we should have observed > 223 instead of no chromosomes with asymmetric terminal edu signal .
our results suggest that bir either does not occur or is so infrequent that its role within the concert of dsb repair mechanisms can at best be a minor one in organisms with a large dna content ( > 1  mb ) per chromosome arm .
are repaired via bir if the endonuclease ho causes one dsb per diploid yeast cell .
unidirectional replication forks that override distal replication origins have to migrate up to the arm ends , or , alternatively , the requirement of recurrent invasion of 3-ends into other double helices , are presumptions for which experimental evidence is lacking so far .
