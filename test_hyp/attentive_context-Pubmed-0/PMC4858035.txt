these findings are similar to those reported in the literature.22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 
  to our knowledge , this study is the first to describe the prognostic significance of identifying a higher number of lymph nodes positive for metastasis in dogs , as has been reported in humans.1 , 39 another novel aspect is the use of a more accurate technique for measuring metastases , which yields a more detailed representation of the metastatic load of the lymph nodes in these animals . in this study , dogs with lymph node metastases with diameters > 7.32  mm had lower overall survival .
histological type is one of the most important prognostic factors in dogs with mammary tumors and , our results are similar to those described in the literature.23 , 24 we found that solid carcinomas are extremely aggressive histologically and have a worse prognosis compared with histologically welldifferentiated tumors , such as carcinomas in mixed tumors , papillary carcinoma , and tubular carcinoma .
another interesting finding was that the presence of itc in the lymph nodes of dogs with malignant mammary tumors was associated with lower overall survival in comparison to dogs with no metastatic malignant mammary tumors .
