we report here the case of a 57-year - old patient with unstable psoriasis , who developed unexpected methotrexate toxicity and cyclosporine - induced thrombocytosis in a span of two weeks of being given both drugs sequentially .
we present this case to highlight the as - yet - unknown toxicities and interactions encountered with the administration of methotrexate and cyclosporine in the treatment of psoriasis .
we present this case to highlight that unknown long - term toxicities and unexplored interactions between systemic agents used for psoriasis still remain a chink in our therapeutic armamentarium for this common disease .
psoriasis is a common , chronic , disfiguring , relapsing , inflammatory , and proliferative condition of the skin .
long - term treatment of moderate - to - severe psoriasis is challenging and often requires a combination , rotational or sequential therapy , with two or more systemic agents .
although it had been avoided earlier , combination therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporine is being increasingly found to be safe and useful in the management of psoriasis .
a 57-year - old male , who was known to be suffering from psoriasis vulgaris for the past 10 years , presented to us with features of unstable psoriasis for a duration of two weeks . he had been previously treated for multiple exacerbations with methotrexate ( cumulative dose - 2285 mg ) , cyclosporine , and topical steroids , on separate instances .
