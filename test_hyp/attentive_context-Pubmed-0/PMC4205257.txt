the coil migration occurred during an endovascular embolization performed for treatment of a mca bifurcation aneurysm at a local medical center where no neurovascular surgeon is available .
a 63-year - old man was referred to chonbuk national university hospital emergency center because of a coil migration during endovascular coil embolization .
we report on migration of a coil into the inferior branch of the middle cerebral artery ( mca ) , which was retrieved by craniectomy and arteriotomy .
rapid extraction of the migrated coil as possible is critical , and , for this reason , a skillful neurovascular specialist who can provide appropriate surgical management and endovascular management for such a patient with a coil migration complication can come in handy .
neurosurgical management is one of the most effective ways to revascularize parent artery occlusion by coil migration . in order not to leave any sequela associated with coil migration ,
since the introduction of the guglielmi detachable coils in the early 1990s , endovascular detachable coil embolization has become one of the most preferred treatment modalities for intracranial aneurysms .
for achievement of a successful endovascular coil embolization , selection of the right indication is essential and should be performed carefully because unexpected complication can occur during the procedure .
