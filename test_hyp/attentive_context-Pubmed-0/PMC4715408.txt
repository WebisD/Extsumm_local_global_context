, we tried to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with mtle - hs with those who had tle due to other etiologies in order to identify potentially differentiating clinical characteristics between these two groups of patients . 

epilepsy risk factors were reported to be as follows ( mtle - hs vs. others ) : parental consanguinity in 41 / 30 ( p= 0.6 ) , family history of epilepsy in 18 / 10 ( p= 0.6 ) , significant head trauma in 15 / 7 ( p= 0.4 ) , cns infection in 2 / 2 ( p= 0.6 ) and pregnancy complications in 2 / 3 ( p= 0.3 ) . 
 

174 patients were eligible to enter the study ( 105 patients with mtle - hs and 69 patients with tle due to other etiologies ) .
video - eeg monitoring was available in 155 patients ; and 19 patients had a routine eeg only .
right sided , left sided or bilateral focal epileptiform discharges ( i.e. , temporal seizures , spikes or sharp waves ) were observed in 36 , 38 , and 20 patients with mtle - hs and 31 , 21 and 13 patients with other etiologies , respectively ( p= 0.4 ) . focal polymorphic delta activity or temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity ( tirda ) was seen in 60 and 7 patients with mtle - hs , respectively .
