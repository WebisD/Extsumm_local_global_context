the findings of this study suggest that particulated autogenous bone with fibrin glue and solid autogenous bone blocks were superior in new bone formation to bioactive glass and tricalcium phosphate , while tricalcium phosphate granules were found to be superior to bioactive glass with more new bone formation in the rabbit critical - sized defect model .
the aim of this study was to evaluate bone healing in rabbit critical - sized bicortical calvarial defects comparing two different synthetic scaffold materials , solid bioactive glass and tricalcium phosphate granules versus solid or particulated autogenous bone .
were superior to bag and tcp ( p = 0.012 , p = 0.025 , p = 0.019 and p = 0.024 , respectively ; table 1 ) .
since granular materials were used in the form of tricalcium phosphate and particulated autogenous bone chips no mechanical testing was planned in this study since granular scaffolds are known to be characteristically non - loadbearing materials .
the micro - ct analysis also showed significantly more new bone formation with tcp granules than with bag scaffolds ( p = 0.024 , table 1 ) . 

micro - computed tomography ( micro - ct ) serves as a new and accurate tool to analyze bone healing and to evaluate the bone formation on biomaterials such as tcp and bag .
