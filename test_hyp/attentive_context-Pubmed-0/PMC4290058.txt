thus fish consumers should eat more o. niloticus to get a variety of fas types and r. argentea to obtain high levels of epa and dpa .
the present study investigated the types and levels of 3 pufas in four different species , nile perch ( lates niloticus ) , nile tilapia ( oreochromis niloticus ) , tilapia zillii , and dagaa ( rastrineobola argentea ) in mwanza gulf of lake victoria .
o. niloticus was found to contain more types of fas and 3 pufas than l. niloticus , t. zillii , and r. argentea .
the dominant 3 pufas in all four sampled commercial fish species were docosatrienoic acid , docosahexaenoic acid , docosapentaenoic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid , and eicosatetraenoic acid ( table 2 ) .
some of the types of fas that were found only in o. niloticus included hexadecadienoic acid , alpha linolenic acid , 9-tetradecenoic acid , 11-tetradecenoate , and 11 , 13-eicosadienoic acid ( table 1 ) .
tukey 's hsd multiple comparisons test showed significant higher levels of epa in r. argentea than o. niloticus ( p = 0.001 ) , t. zillii ( p = 0.036 ) , and l. niloticus ( p = 0.009 ) .
