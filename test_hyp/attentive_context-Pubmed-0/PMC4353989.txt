epigastric hernia repair through a mini - abdominoplasty incision is a reliable method to approach an abdominal wall defect with an esthetic procedure .
we report a case of epigastric hernia repair through a transverse lower abdominal incision with the resection of excess of skin .
we find this approach suitable for those people who need a surgical repair of an epigastric hernia and have such conditions:laxity of the skin in the lower part of the abdomen.high position of the navel.patients refusing midline vertical scar .
the use of the mini - abdominoplasty approach isolates the incision from the hernial defect and repair .
a 37 year - old female patient was diagnosed an epigastric hernia with a little diastasis recti .
we found a little difficult to access to the epigastric area through the subcutaneous tunnel , but , when the defect is not too big to repair and the flaps are elevated till the xiphoid process , then it is easy to prepare the posterior fascia and to inset the polypropylene mesh . in conclusion
epigastric hernia is a type of abdominal wall hernias due to a weakness , gap or opening in the muscles or tendons of the upper abdominal wall , on the alba line between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process .
