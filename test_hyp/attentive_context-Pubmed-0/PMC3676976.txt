its anti - inflammatory property is actively studied in macrophages and ex vivo human whole - blood models   . in this study , we investigated the anti - inflammatory capacity of naringenin to regulate cytokines and chemokines produced by mouse j774 macrophages infected with live c. trachomatis ( mopn nigg ii ) .
we used multiplex elisa to determine a broad range of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced during the interaction of c. trachomatis and macrophages .
like other infection agents , c. trachomatis induces the secretion of various inflammatory mediators upon its infection of macrophages . in the present study , we employed multiplex elisa to identify and quantify cytokines and chemokines in supernatants from macrophages infected with live c. trachomatis .
overall , our results show increased phosphorylation of p38 map kinase in c. trachomatis infected macrophages , which was downregulated by naringenin , suggesting a potential downstream mechanism for naringenin to regulate inflammatory mediators .
combining these findings suggests that naringenin downregulates tlr2 and cd86 expression at both the protein and mrna gene transcripts levels , thus underscoring its role in regulating c. trachomatis inflammation in macrophages . among the many mapk pathways
overall , our results indicate that naringenin has an anti - inflammatory effect against c. trachomatis induced inflammatory mediators by macrophages . to ensure that the inhibitory effect of naringenin is not attributed to cell death
