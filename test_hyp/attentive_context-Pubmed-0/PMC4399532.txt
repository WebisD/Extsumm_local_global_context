as expected , dental students scored the lowest total dental anxiety scores ( table 2 ) which were significantly lower than those scored by either medical or engineering students ( f = 14.13 , p = 0.00 ) .
although the current study utilized the modified anxiety scale and investigated the levels of dental anxiety among university students from different fields of study and the sample size was representative and large , further studies are required to investigate the effect of various correlates on dental anxiety .
