univariate analysis was performed to assess the influence on overall survival of the following factors : age > 75 , histologic type of tumor ( mucinous adenocarcinoma versus adenocarcinoma ) , peritoneal cancer index ( pci ) , completeness of cytoreduction score ( ccs ) , amount of blood transfused , duration of crs + hipec , and occurrence of postoperative complications .
pci was 25 ( 439 ) and a complete removal of the peritoneal disease ( ccs0 ) was achieved in 16 patients ( 53.3% ) , while in the younger group ( < 70 years ) the mean pci was 24 ( 339 ) and a ccs0 was achieved in 55.7% .
using prospectively collected data from our institution with specialized interest in peritoneal surface malignancies , we examined the outcomes in the elderly patients who underwent crs and hipec .
three patients from the older group ( 10% ) required surgical intervention in order to deal with acute and severe complications compared to five patients ( 7.1% ) from the younger group . 

also the treatment is feasible in patients over 70 years with good performance status and is well selected after consideration of the tumor volume , grading , and the type of resection .
