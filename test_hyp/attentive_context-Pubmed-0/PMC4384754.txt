the structure of k3eu3tio2(otbu)11(ome / oh)(tbuoh ) is based on a k3eu3o octahedron capped by a k3tio tetrahedron on the k3 face,7 and the metal atoms in sm4tio(oipr)148 and ( tb0.9er0.1)4tio(oipr)149 form a trigonal bipyramid with an encapsulated 5-oxygen atom . although the work reported here involves only structural issues , the mixed ln / ti clusters could be interesting precursors for mixed - oxide materials.10
an interesting side aspect of this work is that no acetate and only methacrylate ligands are incorporated into the clusters .
the cluster structures described in this article show a clear correlation with the ionic radii of the trivalent metal atom ( see table1 ) .
this is also seen for the alternatively formed clusters lati4o3(oipr)2(omc)11 with the largest ln ions ( lati4 and ce2ti4 ) in which the coordination number of the ln atom is nine .
carboxylate - substituted tim oxo clusters with trivalent metals are only known for y. in previous work , three y / ti clusters of the general composition ti4y2o4(omc)12x2l2 ( x = -omc or och2ch2ome ; l = meoch2ch2oh or mcoh ) were obtained upon treating ti(oipr)4 and y(och2ch2ome)3 with methacrylic acid , among them y2ti4o4(omc)14(homc)2 ( y2ti4).5 because the variance of the ion size of trivalent rare - earth ions is much smaller than that of the divalent metals mentioned above , much more detailed information on the dependence of ion size of a specific cluster structure can be expected .
