the present study was performed to investigate the protective effect of interaction between melatonin and vagus nerve during gastric i / r .
it is suggested that melatonin is neuroprotective in gastric i / r probably by decreasing gastritis and mda and increasing the activities of cat , sod and gpx .
the results of this study showed that melatonin administration decreased neutrophils infiltration and mda level and increased sod , cat and gpx activities in gastric tissue . also , vagus stimulation increased neutrophils infiltration and mda level in gastric tissue while melatonin administration along with vagus stimulation decreased the effect of vagus stimulation in gastric tissue .
these effects of melatonin are probably mediated by vagus nerve . moreover , in gastric i / r , melatonin can reverse harmful effects of vagus stimulation .
probably , vagus nerve and melatonin have interactions in their protective effects during gastric i / r events
moreover , in our study , a stimulation of vagus nerve increased gastritis which was associated with an increase in mda level while vagotomy after i / r was ineffective .
, melatonin can reduce gastritis during i / r , probably through decreasing the activity of oxidant enzymes and increasing the activity of anti - oxidant enzymes such as sod , cat and gpx .
