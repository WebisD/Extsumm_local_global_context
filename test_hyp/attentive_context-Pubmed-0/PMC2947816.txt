the purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology and preliminary data of this study . in particular , we wish to highlight the advantages and disadvantages associated with using survey methodology via the internet to study uncommon vascular manifestations of ssc .
of these , 16 of the 66 ( 24% ) with hypertensive crisis and 5 of the 10 ( 50% ) with normotensive crisis were on an ace inhibitor or an arb prior to the onset of src .
fifteen percent ( 15% ) of patients were positive for an rna polymerase autoantibody ( although not all centers tested for this antibody ) and 42% for a speckled antinuclear antibody ( figure 2 ) . of the 76 patients , 66 ( 87% ) had a hypertensive src and 10 ( 13% ) a normotensive src according to the recruiting physician .
twenty - two percent ( 22% ) of the patients were on an ace inhibitor and 5% on an arb immediately prior to the onset of the src ( table 2 ) .
over 50% of the patients were also on glucocorticoids immediately prior to the onset of src , at a mean dose of 17  mg / d of prednisone ( or its equivalents ) .
