an illustration of this is seen in the guidelines for the surviving sepsis campaign , in which the evidence for different treatment modalities was evaluated in a formalized way .
intensive care medicine is a comparatively young speciality , and within our arsenal of treatments the amount of evidence - based knowledge is often embarrassingly low .
this is highlighted by a report from colleagues in the netherlands presented in this issue of critical care .
nevertheless , a short period of starvation appears to be a part of clinical treatment in many icus .
systematic under - feeding of icu patients may be used as a marker of suboptimal care . wherever it is considered a human right not be hungry
does it have any bearing on outcome in the icu or during the post - icu period ?
although not evidence based in any prospective , controlled , randomized clinical trials , it is unlikely that anyone would dispute that under - feeding eventually leads to death .
whose attending physician is unsure regarding which modality will be optimal , the results demonstrate a very low feeding success rate with enteral nutrition and that complications are related to the duration of nutritional treatment , regardless of the mode of administration . in general terms it has repeatedly been shown that when patients are given only enteral nutrition , the success of feeding is below 70% .
