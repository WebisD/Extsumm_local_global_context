to conclude , adolescents'/young adults ' pr and pss of nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse differ from their perception of illicit drug use , particularly for crack or cocaine .
therefore , we hypothesize that ease of access to nonprescription and prescription drugs will be predictive of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . based on kandel 's   adolescent socialization theory and the proposals by friedman   and manchikanti   about the role of pr , pss , and ease of access in the increased prevalence of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse , we hypothesize that these variables will be predictive of misuse .
their perceptions are important because they are correlated with misuse and program planners should work towards targeting these perceptions to prevent and decrease misuse .
  as discussed in friedman   and manchikanti , we proposed that pr , perception of illicit drugs being safer than street drugs , pss , and access to nonprescription and prescription drug misuse would be significantly related to misuse .
we hypothesize therefore that medicine kept in the home being a significant predictor of misuse may be due to a combination of access and acceptability of use for medical reasons as suggested by manchikanti   and consistent with social reinforcement and imitation .
