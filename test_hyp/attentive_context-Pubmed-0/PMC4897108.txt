this research paper highlights by means of experimental , numerical , and analytical tool the behaviour of a bimaterial zinc / steel interface submitted to mechanical loading . in particular , the case of crack / cracks at the bimaterials interface was considered .
optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) techniques were involved to evaluate the experimental performance of the bimaterials compound .
the sif were calculated to obtain value of the stress singularity that characterizes the crack evolution in the bonding area of bimaterial , for both crack tip values , that is , the fronts of cracks a and b. the analytical , numerical , and experimental assessments prove that the crack / cracks that arise during the hot - dip galvanized steel process will propagate during the mechanical fatigue test .
the main objectives of this paper were to assess the behaviour of the crack / cracks generated at the end of the hot - dip process and to reveal that the numerical computations are in a good agreement with the experimental outcomes .
it was also established that the crack / cracks will stop near the steel - zinc interface at a distance of about 3  m and only in particular cases yield a deflection at the bimaterial interface . to summarize
