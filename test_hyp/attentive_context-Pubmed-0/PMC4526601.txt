we found that pain control methods had an effect on vas score and fragmentation rate of the stones with multivariate analysis ( p = 0.000 and p = 0.012 , respectively and adjusted
the results of this study showed that a pethidine combination with diazepam was superior to diclofenac in combination with hyoscine - n - butyl bromide . by providing good analgesia and sedation ,
there was no significant difference with regard to vomiting ; however , the nausea rates were higher in the first group ( p = 0.02 ) ( table 1b ) .
the responses to the two questions , as noted previously , were higher in the second group ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 1b ) . with regard to the pain scores ,
the main purpose of this study was to compare two treatment modalities for pain control during the eswl procedure .
the difference between groups with regard to oxygen saturation was not significant ( p = 0.06 ) ; however , the difference in pulse rate was significant ( p < 0.001 ) .
chaussy and thuroff showed that the need for analgesia during the eswl depends on the lithotripter used , the stone location , age , gender , and the number of shock waves performed . according to the results of this study , the pain scores were higher in women ; however , this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.06 for scale 1 and p = 0.3 for scale 2 ) ( table 3 ) .
