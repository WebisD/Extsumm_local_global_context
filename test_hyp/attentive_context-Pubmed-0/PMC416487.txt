a 56-year - old man was referred for biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch ( bpd - ds ) for intractable complications associated with morbid obesity .
bpd - ds : biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch c - pap : continuous positive airway pressure device vgb : vertical gastric banding nih : national institutes of health e / a ratio : early / atrial transmitral filling velocity
the patient had an hemodynamically stable pulmonary emboli on the day 12 after surgery and was anticoagulated .
obesity is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease ( cad ) and mortality [ 6 - 8 ] .
mitral doppler at rest and during the valsalva maneuver before and after biliopancreatic diversion surgery e wave : early transmitral filling velocity a wave : transmitral atrial filling velocity e / a : early / atrial transmitral filling velocity this case report emphasizes the improvement in cardiovascular parameters , including the diastolic function ( demonstrated by a pseudonormal ventricular filling or grade 2 filling pattern ) and sleep apnea syndrome , following weight loss - induced by the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch .
he had all features of the metabolic syndrome and was treated for sleep apnea with a nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure device ( c - pap ) .
