, we aimed to carry out an exposure assessment in selected areas of zambia in order to quantify the prevalence of ddt and its metabolites in soil and water around communities where it was recently used .
low detection limits were also estimated in both soil and water samples and when these are compared to the 1  g / l which is the world health organization ( who ) maximum recommended limit ( mrl ) for ddt and its derivatives in drinking water , they were found to be low enough for analysis
this work is part of a broader research project which aims to link recent ddt exposure to neurodevelopmental outcomes in children of the targeted populations and also evaluate other factors that may be associated with the observed outcomes .
given that the breakdown products dde and ddd are more stable in the environment and human matrices and have been implicated in dire effects , urgent action is required .
the presence of ddt and its metabolites in environmental samples from soils and water of selected study areas has been demonstrated .
the concentrations varied in all the study areas but the highest amounts of ddt at 25.8  ng / g were determined around a rural homestead of chongwe followed by 25.7  ng / g in soils collected very close to the exterior walls of a house in chawama township .
