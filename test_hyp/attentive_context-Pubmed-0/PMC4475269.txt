its molecular genetic basis is not yet fully clear , and the same is true of its diagnosis , treatment , and prognosis .
nccm is a primary genetic cardiomyopathy , caused by a defect in endomyocardial morphogenesis . as a result ,
now , it increasingly attracts scientific attention , especially because the condition has not been fully understood so far and is thus a subject of ongoing investigations on its pathology , development , clinical course , and therapy ( 1 ) .
syncopies have not been mentioned so far in possible signs of the disease but are plausible since it is a result of cerebral hypoperfusion . in advanced stages ,
when the angiogenesis of coronary arteries is not accompanied by a simultaneous regression of trabeculae , nccm is occurring ( 2 ) .
more aggressive treatments such as surgical interventions have been reported in severe nccm cases ( 6 ) . in our case , the symptoms were still limited to situations where our patient is physically challenged .
the exact prevalence is not known and it is assumed to bear a significant number of undiagnosed cases . in echocardiography , it is found in 1 of 2,000 studies . since the diagnosis is defined by structural features , which can only be evaluated by cardiac imaging , mostly transthoracic echocardiography .
