pregnant patients may present with ventricular tachycardia during any trimester careful and timely clinical , electrocardiographic , as well as echocardiographic assessment help identify those individuals with structural cardiac abnormalities such as congenital heart disease or peripartum cardiomyopathy , as well as those with long qt syndrome who will need specific management beyond therapy for the arrhythmia . in those stable patients with structurally normal hearts ,
ventricular tachycardias ( vt ) may be seen in pregnancy and can manifest as a new onset arrhythmia or be exacerbated by pregnancy and can cause concern for the well - being of both the mother and the fetus .
a study of 11 pregnant women who experienced a new onset of vt during pregnancy showed that onset was distributed equally over the three trimesters and disappeared completely during the postpartum period.1 the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of new - onset vt during pregnancy have not been adequately investigated .
identification of the location of origin of tachycardia will help in choice of appropriate medical therapy .
although the majority of vts that occur during the pregnancy are benign , in women with structural heart disease , arrhythmias ( especially those of ventricular origin ) is one of the five independent predictors of having an adverse outcome during pregnancy.2,3 peripartum cardiomyopathy ( ppcm ) needs to be considered in women presenting with vt in the last month of pregnancy.4,5 the criteria for the diagnosis of ppcm include : development of congestive heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery , absence of preexisting cardiac dysfunction , and absence of identifiable cause of heart failure and lv systolic dysfunction demonstrated by classic echocardiographic criteria.6 hence in women presenting with vt in the last month of pregnancy , an urgent echocardiographic study can assist in establishing a diagnosis of ppcm .
