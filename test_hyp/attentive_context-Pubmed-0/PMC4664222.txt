in summary , the present study demonstrated that mis - tlif with ups fixation leads to similar clinical outcomes , compared with bps procedure for multi - level dld . despite an association with decreased operative time and less blood loss ,
based on the previous studies which have shown similar clinical and fusion results of ups as those of bilateral fixation , we conducted this retrospective study to compare clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with multi - segment dld treated with ups or bps instrumented tlif .
the ups technique had a lower fusion rate than the bps construct did . due to the limitations of this study , multi - center studies with more patients and longer follow - up period
all parameters , including blood loss , operative time , duration of hospital stay , complication rate , visual analog scale ( vas ) , and oswestry disability index ( odi ) scores , were obtained and compared to evaluate efficacy between the 2 groups .
both mean postoperative vas and odi improved significantly in each group , compared with preoperative vas and odi ; however , no statistically significant differences were obtained between the 2 groups ( table 2 ) . with respect to fusion rate ,
