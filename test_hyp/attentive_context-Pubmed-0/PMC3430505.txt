it is possible that improved operational symptoms could lead to increased measurement precision and a better assessment of the validity of diagnostic categories .
a systematic review of literature was performed to identify the prevalence of adhd in iranian children and adolescents ( up to 18 years old ) from 1977 .
quality assessment checklist for prevalence studies  which assesses sampling , measurement and analysis method of studies : does the study design yield a sample of respondents representative of defined target group , do the survey instruments yield reliable and valid measures of adhd and other key concepts ( also for translated version ) , and were special features of the sampling design accounted for in the analysis or subgroups prevalence rates reported ?
the other limitation was that some studies had reported only the mean score of the indexes .
inclusion criteria were : 1 ) conducting a study by generalizability of the produced data to the population of the same age ; 2 ) using valid instruments to assess adhd diagnosis or symptoms ; and 3 ) presenting a prevalence of adhd or attention deficit and / or hyperactivity symptoms .
one limitation of the literature we reviewed is the reliance of many studies on rating scale measures rather than interviews with patients and parents . unlike rating scale methods , interview - based procedures come close to reproduce the results one might expect from a clinical evaluation and are better able to incorporate the impairment and pervasiveness criteria of the dsm diagnoses of adhd . as discussed by hartman et al ( 21 ) ,
