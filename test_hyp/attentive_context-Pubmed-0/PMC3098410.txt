the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of admission estimated glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) on in - hospital outcomes in patients with st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) undergoing primary pci using data from the korea acute myocardial infarction registry ( kamir ) .
renal dysfunction is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population,1 ) and it is associated with an increased risk of death and cardiovascular events in patients with a broad range of cardiovascular diseases , including heart failure,2 ) stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci)3)4 ) and acute coronary syndromes.5)6 ) in the setting of acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) , mortality risk is increased in patients with renal dysfunction ( rd ) of any degree of severity.7 - 9 ) primary pci is the best reperfusion strategy for ami patients and its mortality benefit has been shown in randomized trials.10 - 12 ) however , most of these trials frequently excluded patients with rd , and few studies examining the outcomes of ami patients with rd undergoing primary pci have been reported . to date
in addition , decreased estimated gfr was also identified as a powerful independent predictor of in - hospital mortality . when compared with the normal rf group , adjusted or was 2.67 { 95% confidence interval ( ci ) : 1.44 to 4.93 ; p=0.002 } in the moderate rd group and 4.09 ( 95% ci : 1.48 to 11.28 ; p=0.006 ) in the severe rd group ( table 5 ) .
