the present study has been undertaken to compare the advantages and disadvantages of medpore and osseous augmentation in genioplasty procedure .
hard tissue to soft tissue relation in case of osseous genioplasty was 1:0.88 , while in the case of medpore augmentation it was 1:0.77 , i.e. , soft tissue predictability of osseous genioplasty was better in comparison with medpore augmentation . in brief , medpore is indicated for mild to moderate horizontal chin deficiency and to modify chin shape , i.e. , for minor contour irregularity , while osseous genioplasty is recommended for any chin , i.e. , short , long or for laterogenia .
horizontal osteotomy for chin augmentation is an old and established procedure while medpore has become popular in the recent years for facial skeletal augmentation .
hard tissue to soft tissue relation in case of osseous genioplasty was 1:0.88 , while in the case of medpore augmentation it was 1:0.77 , i.e. , soft tissue predictability of osseous genioplasty was better in comparison with medpore augmentation .
