csf : cerebrospinal fluid ; icp : intracranial pressure ; mri : magnetic resonance imaging ; onsd : optic nerve sheath diameter .
present their research correlating magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) measurements of onsd with icp . in a retrospective review of 38 patients with traumatic brain injury requiring both invasive icp monitoring and mri
the recognition that elevated intracranial pressure ( icp ) is transmitted through the optic nerve and its sheath has been known for many years . this physiological process is the basis for the physical exam finding of papilledema on fundoscopic examination .
recently , interest has turned to measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter ( onsd ) through non - invasive imaging technologies to provide surrogate markers for early elevated icp . in this issue of critical care , geeraerts and colleagues  
the study by geeraerts and colleagues adds to a growing body of research demonstrating a correlation between increased onsd and elevated icp . by demonstrating the correlation of mri measurements of the onsd with invasive icp monitoring
the research presented by geeraerts and colleagues is unique in its comparison of onsd with simultaneous direct measurements of icp through invasive monitoring .
