the purpose of the present study was to measure the three - dimensional ( 3d ) movement of 1st molars after using this newly designed distalizing appliance .
maxillary 1st molars were moved distally an average of 2.3  1.1 mm , and the difference between the right and left sides was not statistically significant ( p = 0.63 ) .
the mia - tpa is an appliance that can achieve absolute anchorage , and successfully drive maxillary 1st molars distally .
the mean duration of distalization was 6.8  2.8 months ( range 2 - 14 months ) , thus the average rate of distalization achieved via the method utilized in the current study was 0.4  0.2 mm / month .
the mean intermolar width increase was 2.9  1.8 mm ( range 0.6 - 6.8 mm ) .
maxillary 1st molars were slightly rotated mesially around the palatal root after distalization , though the amount of rotation was not statistically significant ( this rotation is shown with a minus sign in table 2 ) .
the sample group consisted of 26 patients ( 22 females , 4 males ) with an average age of 19.8  6.3 years ( range 12 - 36 years ) at the beginning of treatment ( table 1 ) .
