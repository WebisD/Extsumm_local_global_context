we are currently studying the role of this modality vis - a - vis 99mtc - mibi scan with early spect / ct in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism .
nuclear medicine imaging techniques have played an important role in the detection and localization of parathyroid adenomas , with 99mtc - methoxy - isobutyl - isonitrile ( mibi ) scan currently being the standard test used .
although f - choline has been used as a photon emission tomography ( pet ) tracer for some years now , its utility in the detection of parathyroid adenomas has only recently been explored .
the addition of single photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography ( spect / ct ) has had an incremental benefit in exact localization of the adenomas .
a 45-year - old female patient presented with complaints of bone pain and difficulty in walking for last 3 months .
surgical excision of abnormal parathyroid tissue whether adenoma , carcinoma , or hyperplasia is considered as the definitive treatment of hyperparathyroidism .
surgery is the standard of care due to potential long - term skeletal , cardiovascular , and neuropsychiatric effects of even mild hyperparathyroidism .
it appears to provide additional hope specially in cases of low gland mass and multi - gland involvement due to better resolution of pet / ct as compared to spect / ct coupled with good image contrast .
