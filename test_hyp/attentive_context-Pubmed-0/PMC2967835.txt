we found no significant relationships between the levels of cyclooxygenase mrna expression in duodenal biopsies and the content of fatty acids in feces , except for the estimates of the content of delta-9-desaturase ( stearoyl - coa desaturase , scd ) activity , namely the ratio of palmitolic acid / palmitic acid   in the ileostomy group .
we may suggest that fatty acid content in feces is related to dietary intake , serum lipids , and fatty acid composition in duodenal biopsies , even in colectomized familial adenomatous polyposis patients .
moreover , the content of linoleic acid in feces correlated significantly to the proportion of myristic acid ( r = 0.8 , p < .001 ) in duodenal biopsies , whereas the content of alpha - linolenic acid in feces correlated inversely to eicosaenoic acid ( r = 0.6 , p <
the content of palmitic acid in feces was positively correlated to levels of ldl - cholesterol ( r = 0.05 , p = .05 ) .
no significant correlations were found between the content of different fatty acids in feces and the fatty acid dietary intake ( data not shown ) .   with the exception of the palmitoleic acid / palmitic acid ratio and levels of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in duodenal biopsies ( r = 0.8 , p = .003 ) , no relationships were found between fatty acids in feces and the levels of cyclooxygenase mrna expression ( figure 1 ) .
