the present data first demonstrate that uag , unlike ag , reverts diabetes - induced epc damage by inhibiting activation of the nox regulatory protein rac1 ; as a consequence , uag protects diabetic epcs from senescence and improves their vasculogenic capability ; again , only uag rescues epc mobilization under diabetic conditions by restoring enos phosphorylation , and specific uag - binding sites mediate its effects .
this effect results from uag - mediated inhibition of rac1 activation , a prerequisite for nadph oxidase assembly .
in contrast , basic and clinical studies have proposed ag as a diabetogenic hormone ( 8,38 ) . indeed , clinical conditions of insulin resistance are associated with an alteration in the circulating ghrelin profile with relative ag excess with respect to uag ( 12 ) .
although we can not exclude that uag may act in a paracrine manner by locally inducing the release of vegf from bone marrow stromal cells , we demonstrate that short - term treatment with uag , but not ag , of bone marrow cells in vitro leads to akt and enos phosphorylation and that , in vivo , these events are associated with mmp9 activation and epc mobilization .
