we report a case of successful angioplasty of forearm arteries in a patient with esrf , and thereby saving her finger , with good clinical and functional outcome .
a 51-year - old right - handed lady with esrf presented with a 2 months history of progressively worsening infected gangrene involving her right ring finger which developed after a nail clipping injury .
this report emphasized the importance of specialist vascular care with a combination of expert care and angioplasty of forearm arteries , even in delayed setting , with successful salvage of the patient s finger .
many patients with finger gangrene presented to orthopedic surgeons for primary amputation , but there are more reports29 now of revascularization of forearm arteries to be a useful adjunct for finger salvage .
patients with end - stage renal failure ( esrf ) are more prone to finger gangrene , especially those with multilevel stenosis or calcification involving the forearm vessels , as shown in clinical and autopsy studies.1 this is also particularly important in patients with elbow - based arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis , as there is a danger of arterial steal .
with improvements in endovascular technology and wide availability of low - profile small balloons , angioplasty of the forearm arteries should be considered for finger salvage in patients with esrf .
