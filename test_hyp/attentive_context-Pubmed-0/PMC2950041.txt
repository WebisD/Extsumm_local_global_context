the phylum apicomplexa includes a large group of protozoan parasites responsible for a wide range of animal and human diseases . among the human pathogens are plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium vivax , the major causative agents of human malaria , as well as cryptosporidium parvum and toxoplasma gondii , which are particularly pathogenic in immunocompromised patients .
emerging evidence indicates that viruses and bacteria manipulate the microrna ( mirna ) pathways of the host cells they infect .
these findings open an exciting opportunity to pursue a deep understanding of how the host proteome can be reprogrammed dynamically and reversibly upon apicomplexa infection .
an additional line of research should explore the upstream regulatory mechanisms , that is , how the parasites directly interfere with rna silencing pathways and , more specifically , the parasite effectors that are involved in the process . as discussed above , in response to cryptosporidium and toxoplasma infections , the expression of specific mirna genes is altered at the transcriptional level .
cryptosporidium is able to trigger the down - regulation of let-7i ( a mirna with complementarity to toll - like receptor ( tlr)-4 mrna ) in the host cell , leading to the up - regulation of tlr4 , a key pathogen recognition molecule that plays a central role in epithelial innate immunity to cryptosporidium infection .
