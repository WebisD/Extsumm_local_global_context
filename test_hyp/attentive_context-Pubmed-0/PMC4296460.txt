this study is aimed at testing the efficacy of hyaluronan gel as an adjunct to caf in root coverage .
comparison of mean clinical attachment level values between experimental and control groups student 's t - test showing the cal difference between control and experimental groups on an average , experimental site showed initial rd of approximately 3.2 mm  0.78 mm and control sites 2.9 mm  0.73 mm .
descriptive analysis of two groups mean probing pocket depth values plotted against time for experimental and control groups results of repeated measure anova for ppd for between experimental and control groups clinical attachment level had a significant gain and stability , at 24 weeks follow - up both groups .
descriptive analysis of two groups mean recession depth values plotted against time for experimental and control groups percentage of root coverage comparison of mean percentage of root coverage between control ( c ) and experimental ( e ) group at 24 weeks , the change in rd was statistically significant ( p = 0.00 ) in both groups [ tables 6 and 7 ] .
mean probing pocket depth ( ppd ) in experimental sites at baseline was 1.8  0.42 mm , and in control sites it was 2.0  0.47 mm . at the end of 24 weeks
