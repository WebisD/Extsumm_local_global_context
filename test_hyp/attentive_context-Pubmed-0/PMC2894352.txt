thus , we have presented an example of the inassbp quaternary qds , pits and dots  pits cooperative structures growth on the inas(100 ) substrates by lpe . the interaction and surface morphology of the dots  pits combinations were investigated .
the results of our study can be also used for producing controlled arrays of strain - induced qds , which is very important for the fabrication of wide - band photodiodes , thermo - photovoltaic cells and other inas - based mid - infrared devices .
application of the inassbp and other similar quaternary materials opens up interesting physical and technological prospects for the dirigible growth of qds , pits and dots  pits cooperative systems . by the corresponding and independent variations of the v - group elements concentrations ,
lifshits  slezov - like distribution for the amount and surface density of  small  qds , and pits versus their average diameter was experimentally detected .
independent variations of the third and fourth components provide corresponding sign of the misfit ; i.e. , providing the tensile or compressive misfit stress .
at the first case , elastic strain will be relaxed by the formation of qds , but at the second one  by the pits . in this article , an example of inassbp quaternary qds , the pits and dots  pits cooperative structure growth on inas(100 ) substrates by lpe , as well as the interaction and surface morphology of the dots  pits combinations are presented and investigated .
