the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) injuries has spawned a great deal of research .
, it should be undertaken only by a surgeon with experience treating pediatric and adolescent injuries of this nature .
this paper aims to discuss acl tears in the skeletally immature patient , specifically focusing on the natural history , nonoperative management , operative management including complications , and prevention of these injuries .
managing acl tears in the skeletally immature patient is a complicated and at times challenging undertaking . as such
while data can be found to support both modes of care , an overwhelming preponderance of the literature supports early operative intervention for complete acl tears in this population .
additionally , this age group is poorly compliant with activity restrictions leading to a significant risk of further meniscal injury or articular cartilage damage   . in a recent systematic literature review , vavken and murray   identified only 1 study with level ii evidence and 10 with level iii evidence on this topic .
consequently , the management strategy for acl injuries in this population is not as clearly elucidated as it is for their skeletally mature counterparts .
as there is little data supporting one surgical technique as superior , patient age and surgeon familiarity and comfort should guide the choice .
