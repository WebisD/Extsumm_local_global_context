however , after adjustment , neither the difference in 30-day mortality ( adjusted or=1.20 ; 95% ci , 0.91 to 1.58 ) , or in 31- to 180-day mortality was significant ( adjusted hr , 1.15 ; 95% ci , 0.93 to 1.43 ) .
patents with current or a history of af had a lower heart rate at 24  hours ( 78 vs. 80  bpm ; p=0.012 ) and at discharge ( 75 vs. 80  bpm ; p<0.001 ; figure 1 ) .
patients with af had a longer median in - hospital length of stay ( 7 vs. 6  days ; p<0.001 ) . compared to patients without af , patients with af had a higher in - hospital all - cause mortality rate ( 2.6% vs. 1.7% ; p=0.015 ) , a higher 30-day all - cause mortality rate ( 4.7% vs. 3.3% ; p=0.005 ) , a higher 31- to 180-day mortality rate ( 11.1% vs. 8% ; p<0.001 ) , and a higher 180-day mortality rate ( 15.3% vs. 11.1% ; p<0.001 ) .
although there was no difference in heart rate at presentation between patients with or without af , heart rate was significantly lower at 6 and 24  hours and at discharge in patients with af and less dyspnea relief at 24  hours for patients with current or a history of af .
