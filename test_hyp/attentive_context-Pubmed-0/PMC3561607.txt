is expected to enable better clinical outcome analysis , including deeper understanding of the correlations between point a dose and dose - volume parameters of the hr - ctv .
mri - guided , conformal bt , the correlation between conventional point a doses and dose - volume parameters of hr - ctv / ir - ctv have been reported , although no phase iii clinical outcome studies between mri - guided , conformal bt and conventional point a based bt are presently available . using the more stable new point a definition
the variance seen between point a definitions comes from two main sources : i ) imprecise implantation of the applicator and/or ii ) inter - planner differences while defining either point a on 2-d radiographs or 3-d imaging datasets .
however , the gynaecological european group of curietherapie and the european society for therapeutic radiology and oncology ( gec - estro ) still recommend the recording of conventional point a doses during 3d - image based planning , at least for a transition period .
the point dose values at manchester point a and new point a were recorded and compared to the prescription dose and volumetric tumor coverage values ( hr - ctv d90 , d100 and ir - ctv d90 ) ( see fig .
