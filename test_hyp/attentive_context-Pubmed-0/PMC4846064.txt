notes : transabdominal two - dimensional ultrasound in the transverse plane showing an abnormal placenta with thinning of the myometrium in the left posterior uterine wall , indicated by an asterisk .
herein , we describe a woman diagnosed with repeated placenta accreta that was complicated by spontaneous rupture of the uterus .
a 32-year - old woman in her fourth pregnancy , with parity of 2 , presented at 19 weeks gestation to the gynecologic emergency department with lower abdominal pain for the past 2 days .
the most severe complication of placenta accreta is spontaneous rupture of the uterus , which poses diagnostic challenges and management dilemmas , and can be a life - threatening event to the mother and fetus .
furthermore , repeated invasive placentation occurred at the same site , and not at the cesarean section ( cs ) scar , which raises a fundamental question regarding the mechanism of trophoblast implantation and location of recurrence of placenta accreta .
this case demonstrates increasing placental invasiveness and , to the best of our knowledge , is a first report of this kind .
understanding the processes that influence the timing and location of this life - threatening complication may set the basis for better diagnosis and management protocols .
