the aim of this study was to examine the tmj sounds with repect to frequency spectra patterns and the integral > 300 hz / < 300 hz ratios via six - months follow - up .
it is suggested that clinicians consider the integral > 300 / < 300 ratios as well as the frequency spectrums to decide the starting - point of the treatment for tmj sounds .
therefore jva will provide the clinician with the visible patterns of tmj sounds for patient management .
the integral > 300 / < 300 ratios in group i and group ii listed in table i and ii show variations before and after the six - months recordings respectively . in group ii ,
the frequency spectra in some subjects showed similar patterns while the others showed varied patterns . by the comparative study between the integral > 300 / < 300 ratios and the frequency spectrums , it was conceivable that the frequency spectrums showed similar patterns at the same location that the joint sound occurred between before and after the six - months recordings . while the frequency spectra showed varied patterns at the different location that the joint sound occurred in before and after the six - months recordings ( fig . 2 , 3 ) .
