, we investigated the clinical and radiological results and complications of total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) using the advance medial pivot knee for a minimum follow - up of 5 years under the hypothesis that the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing , non - substituting ( ps ) implant designed to replicate the medial pivot motion in the non - arthritic knee would yield satisfying functional improvement without significant complications .
and the incidence of tibial component loosening after using this ultracongruent implant was not remarkable .
the clinical and radiological results of tka using the ps advance medial pivot knee designed to reproduce normal knee kinematics were satisfactory after the minimum 5-year mid - term follow - up .
the ks knee score and function score , and the womac score for pain and stiffness and function were significantly improved ( p<0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .
of the patients who had undergone tka using the ps advance medial pivot knee between october 2004 and december 2006 , 80 patients ( 120 knees ) who were available for more than 5-year follow - up were retrospectively reviewed .
there was significant improvement in the rom between the preoperative and last follow - up assessments : the mean flexion contracture decreased from 7.6 to 1.5 and the mean range of further flexion increased from 115.1 ( rom , 107.5 ) to 120.5 ( rom , 119 ) ( p<0.05 ) .
