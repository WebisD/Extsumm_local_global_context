this includes the identification and presentation of relevant metadata that allows the results to be objectively evaluated and interpreted in a biological context and reproduced in the laboratories of other scientists .
in 2006 , participants at the workshop on analytical and bioinformatic glycomics , agreed that there is an urgent need to develop infrastructure , including standardized protocols for the exchange and reporting of structural glycan data and metadata to implement  a worldwide network of databases containing experimental and analytical data relevant to the structures and functions of glycans 
in addition , adoption of the guidelines by glycomics databases will facilitate methods for processing and mining of the data produced by glycoanalytic experiments . at the moment of writing this paper a guideline for glycomics
structural analysis of glycoconjugates is technically challenging , requiring sophisticated analytical and computational techniques applied at the interface of biology and chemistry .
the mirage guidelines provide a framework that allows this information to be identified and presented in a consistent manner in order to enhance the value of structural analyses that are disseminated by both scientific journals and databases .
the working group defines the tasks , makes general decisions and integrates detailed guidelines , which are developed by subgroups focusing on structural analysis , interaction analysis and bioinformatics .
