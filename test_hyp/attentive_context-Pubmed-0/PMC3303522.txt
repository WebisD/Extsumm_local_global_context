group ii consisted of 25 diagnosed cases of olp ; these cases were subdivided into two groups : group iia and group iib .
better understanding of the etiopathological mechanism underlying olp will help in the development of new treatment strategies , as well as to manage persistent inflammation in patients showing poor response to conventional immunosuppressive drug regimes .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of olp , using cd34 stain to highlight the blood vessels for measuring the mvd .
this study included 40 cases , categorized into two groups : group i and group ii .
comparison of microvessel density between group i and group ii comparison of mvd between group iia and group iib
group iia consisted of 18 diagnosed cases of reticular olp and group iib consisted of 7 diagnosed cases of erosive olp .
our study suggests that angiogenesis is significantly increased in olp as compared to normal oral mucosa [ figure 1 ] , also in erosive olp [ figure 3 ] as compared to reticular olp [ figure 2 ] ; this suggests that angiogenesis is one of the main contributing factors in the progression of olp .
