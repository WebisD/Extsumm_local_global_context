, we aimed to evaluate cell viability of mc3t3-e1 and total protein content on the above - mentioned four different titanium surfaces , as a next series of our experiments .
previously we investigated the influence of two different surface roughness , namely , nanometer smoothing ( ra : approximately 2.0  nm ) and sandblasting ( ra : approximately 1.0  m ) , as well as biochemical treatment , namely , fibronectin immobilization using tresyl chloride - activated technique , of a titanium surface on osteoblast - like cell behavior . it was reported that the nanometer - smooth surface was beneficial for the differentiation of mc3t3-e1 cells and that fn immobilization provided better arrangement of attached cells . in the present study
the filopodia was extending from the cell body to the titanium surface and higher magnification indicated the presence of short - fiber - like structure , which is presumed to be microvilli . comparing ti smooth and ti smooth / fn , ti smooth / fn surface showed more attached cells and attached cells showed better arrangement on ti smooth / fn surface rather than on ti smooth ( figure 3 ) .  
cells attached on nanometer smooth titanium ( ti smooth , ti smooth / fn ) showed the flat shape with a large and thin cytoplasmic layer and with numerous filopodia .
