we analyzed here the rna binding properties of the three most abundantly expressed fxr1p isoforms and show that they have different affinities for the g - quartet rna structure . since all protein members of the fxr family are able to heterodimerize with fmrp , they are believed to act together ( 4 ) . in the present study we determined that , when complexed to fmrp , fxr1p isoforms can modulate its affinity for g - quartet rna and also the dynamics of this complex .
some of these isoforms are differentially expressed in various tissues ( 21 ) . up to date , the ability of full - length fxr1p and fxr2p to bind a g - quartet rna structure in a specific manner has not been reported .
fxr1p has been reported to bind au rich element ( are ) and , through the interaction with this element , to regulate the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) in macrophages ( 16 ) . in the cytoplasm
our data demonstrate that fxr1p has a synergistic molecular function with fmrp rather than a redundant role .
in addition , very little is known concerning the precise function of fxr1p in muscle , and it is possible that muscle - specific fxr1p interacting proteins might modulate its affinity for rna . our analysis to dissect the binding capacities to g - quartet rna fxr1p and its heterodimer with
