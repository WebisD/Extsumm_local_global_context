however , its association with pheochromocytoma in indian subjects has not been reported till date .
though cases of renal artery stenosis , renal artery aneurysm and inferior vena cava thrombosis have been described , we found the uncommon association with ivc thrombosis in an indian patient .
two aspects render our case unusual : 1 ) the coexistence of pheochromocytoma with ivc thrombosis 2 ) though there are case reports citing the association between malignant pheochromocytoma and ivc thrombus , to our sincere belief ; this is the first such report citing this uncommon association from india .
localization of the tumor is done using computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scans .
pheochromocytomas are rare catecholamine producing tumors arising from chromaffine cells in the sympatho adrenal system .
a 48-year - old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of headache , sweating , anxiety , dizziness , nausea and vomiting .
thrombosis of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) has comparable etiological factors to lower limb deep venous thrombosis .
ct or preferably mri imaging are required to delineate ivc anatomy and ascertain proximal extent of the thrombus .
