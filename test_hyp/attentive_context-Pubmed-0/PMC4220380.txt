innovative techniques to incorporate real - time intraoperative imaging and nerve mapping methodologies to identify and preserve the cavernosal nerves seem to have a challenging but promising role in the future .
much of the success achieved in the last decade in terms of improved trifecta outcomes following robotic radical prostatectomy relates to the adoption of an athermal , traction - free , risk - stratified , graded nerve spare approach to preserve the neural hammock .
the introduction of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening over the last two decades has resulted in stage migration of prostate cancer .
it is in the pursuit of these improved oncological outcomes along with preservation of sexual function and continence that ralp can have the greatest impact . in this review ,
we describe the neuroanatomical concepts and recent developments in the ns technique of ralp with a view to improving the  trifecta  outcomes . the pioneering contributions of walsh et al . in 1982 on the anatomic dissection for preservation of the neurovascular bundles ( nvbs ) remains one of the most significant landmarks in urological history .
radical prostatectomy ( rp ) for organ - confined prostate cancer is an effective treatment option but can result in erectile dysfunction ( ed ) and incontinence in a significant proportion of patients .
