a central concept of the step response equation , the eigenvalue , showed different values in healthy and diseased lungs .
recently , a modification of the mbnw method has been introduced , implicitly utilizing a first order difference equation for the calculation of frc based on mass conservation and a change in fio2 of 0.1 . in the present study ,
the difference equation is solved for the step response using basic digital signal processing ( dsp ) techniques   where the step is interpreted as the nitrogen fraction change initiating the measurement . the resulting step response equation by comparing calculated clearance data to experimental and clinical washout data .
a step response equation was derived based on techniques from dsp and used to calculate the course of fetn2 during washout .
 as a function of peep in five patients . in the analysis of mono- vs. bicompartmental analysis we found a difference between mono- and biexponential fit to measured fetn2 in the icu ( copd ) patient
bland & altman analysis showed bias of 0 , upper and lower limits of agreement of 0.49 and 0.5 and error 1.3% , see figure 3 .
the eigenvalue of the step response was shown to be dependent on peep level and to be different among healthy and diseased states of the lung .
