, the coefficient value ( coeff ) measures the incremental patient cost ( i.e. ,  j ) above that of patients in the same admission apr drg associated with the presence of the ppc after accounting for the presence of other ppcs .
isolating and quantifying the incremental cost of a specific type of complication requires the disentangling of these interrelated factors . in order to adjust for the mix and severity of illness of patients , all patient refined diagnosis related groups ( apr drg ) were used to classify patients in terms of their reason for admission and severity of illness at the time of admission ( averill et al . , 2002 ; sedman et al . , 2004 ) .
it is the purpose of this article to develop an estimate of the incremental cost of different types of hospital acquired complications and to determine the total incremental cost burden of hospital acquired complications on the health care system . improved estimates of the magnitude of incremental cost incurred by short term acute hospitals due to hospital acquired complications should stimulate debate around the financial justification for supporting quality improvement efforts aimed at reducing hospital acquired complication rates .
