we describe a patient with pd who had vivid nightmares and dream - enacting behavior that resolved after treatment with zns .
our experience suggests that zns potentially might be effective for the management of vivid nightmares or dream - enacting behavior in patients with early pd .
in 2009 , a 71-year - old man with a history of pulmonary surgery noticed tremor of the left hand and akinesia . in march 2010 , he showed features of moderate parkinsonism , including masked face , stooped posture , bradykinesia , left - side - dominant rigidity , and resting tremor .
this disorder strongly suggested a rapid - eye - movement sleep behavior disorder ( rbd ) . in our patient , who had rbd
our patient showed aggressive and violent behavior associated with vivid nightmares , which probably preceded such behavior , during the middle of the night .
dream enactment associated with aggressive , violent behavior can carry a serious risk of injury to patients , as well as to spouses or caretakers .
recently , zns has been approved as a new adjunctive therapy for motor complications of parkinson 's disease ( pd ) in japan .
