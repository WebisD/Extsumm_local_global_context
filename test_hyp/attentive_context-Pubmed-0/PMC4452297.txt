the objective of this study was to analyze and compare the levels of lp - pla2 and hscrp as predictors of ms in subjects without atherosclerotic disease .
in this study , we have demonstrated in a population without atherosclerotic disease that levels of lp - pla2 activity and hscrp are elevated in subjects with ms .
both biomarkers significantly increased with the number of metabolic risk factors , and both were shown to be independent and statistically significant predictors of ms .
mg / l ) between genders ( 39% in men and 36% in women ) . of note , hscrp was significantly and directly correlated with bmi , waist circumference , blood glucose , systolic bp , non - hdl - c , and fibrinogen , and it was inversely and significantly correlated with hdl - c ( table 3 ) .
men had significantly higher waist circumference ( p < 0.01 ) , systolic and diastolic bp ( p < 0.0001 ) , and creatinine levels ( p < 0.0001 ) than women .
both biomarkers significantly increased with the number of ms components : lp - pla2 levels increased from 163  nmol / ml / min to 198  nmol / ml / min ( p < 0.01 ) and hscrp increased from 1.5  mg / l to 4.1  mg / l ( p = 0.04 ) when subjects with 0 and 3 components of ms were compared ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
