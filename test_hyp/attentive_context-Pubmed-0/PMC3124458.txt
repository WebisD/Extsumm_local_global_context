first described by cushing in 1898 , chyle fistula can induce severe nutritional , metabolic and immune disturbances , delay wound healing , prolong hospital stay and , in the past , even resulted in death   . the incidence rate reported in the literature ranges from 0.5 to 2.5%   . in thyroid surgery , the rate of chyle fistula increases significantly ( p < 0.001 ) with the extent of the surgical procedure : 0.5% after less than total surgery with central compartment node dissection ( ccnd ) , 0.8% in patients with total thyroidectomy and ccnd , 5.1% after total thyroidectomy associated with ipsilateral neck dissection , and 6.2% in patients treated by total thyroidectomy with bilateral neck dissection . due to anatomic reasons ( left side termination of thoracic duct in 7592% ) ,
most chyle fistulas ( 2575% ) develop postoperatively , with a 86% rate of occurrence between the first and the third postoperative day .
a 27-year - old woman was referred to our department for the surgical treatment of a goiter with hyperthyroidism treated for 2 years with neomercazole 10 mg / day and levothyrox 50 g / day .
advances in surgeons knowledge of the anatomic landmarks and variability of the cervical portion of the thoracic duct should minimize the incidence of injuries which lead to an often unrecognized but significant morbidity rate .
