results show that unilateral hearing aid contributed to the elimination or reduction of depression symptoms and of social activity constraints in elderly participants in this research sample group .
moreover , the length of time between assessments was 30 days , shorter than that considered ideal for auditory acclimatization , and even then , benefits occurred , confirming the importance of auditory rehabilitation in elderly .

this is a prospective interventional study of elderly individuals of both sexes with recommended use of hearing aids at a hearing center in porto alegre .
no significant association was found for these variables in the periods before and after the adaptation ( p  >  0.999 ) .
results show evidence of the positive effects of hearing aid use , even if unilateral , helping to reduce the impact that hearing loss has on social relationships and on the quality of life of the elderly.9 results are consistent with another study that examined the short - term benefits of amplification in new users.29 
  the data also show a significant difference in scores obtained in phases 1 and 2 of the gds ( p  =  0.031 ) and hhie - s ( p  <  0.001 ) , confirming a reduction or elimination of depression symptoms and social activity constraints in elderly patients , agreeing with other published studies ( table 4).2
