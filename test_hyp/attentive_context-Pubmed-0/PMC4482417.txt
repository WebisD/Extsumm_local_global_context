finally , these results identify og and sp lesions 
 in dna and rna strands to be the most stable ( table 1 ) , and they support a hypothesis that these lesions in the 
 genome or transcriptome would be much longer lived than the other 
 guanine base lesions .
these data will be paramount for researchers 
 that oxidize oligomers of dna or rna with known sequences and then 
 interpret the reaction yields from a biological prospective , for which 
 oxidation events on these polymers are a rare occurrence .
the 
 current research determined the chemical cleavage rate constants 
 for many lesions derived from oxidation of the nucleobase guanine 
 in dna and rna oligomers . in these studies , the base damages og , sp , 
 gh , z , and 2ih were site - specifically synthesized in dna and rna oligomers . 

in addition , 
 in rna strands , all lesions were found to cleave at a slower rate 
 than their analogous dna counterparts ( table 1 ) .
the alternative 
 approach for identifying lesion sites in dna utilizes a base excision 
 repair enzyme , such as fpg ; however , fpg cleavage also suffers from 
 lesion - dependent cleavage kinetic differences .
