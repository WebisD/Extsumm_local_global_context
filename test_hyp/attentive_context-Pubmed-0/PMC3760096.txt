the object of this study was to examine nurses ' experience of how ethical values are expressed in daily practice in a norwegian hospital where health reforms have been introduced as well as market thinking .
we suggest a change of system based on the caritative leadership theory which may contribute to a combining of nursing and administration in such a way that it prevents suffering in the patient and will also further the development of nursing and care , humane and professional , on all levels in the organization .
we took our point of departure in the national core values in the norwegian specialist health services : respect , quality , and safety .
we also consider formal and regular clinical nursing reflection and supervision as crucial for safeguarding moral practice and thus preventing the development of moral distress .
the collection of data was carried out by conducting focus group interviews with a total of 20 nurses from different somatic and psychiatric bed units in a medium large hospital in norway .
the results of the study demonstrate that all the nurses believe that ethical values are of decisive importance for the quality in nursing .
financial and organizational structures contribute to the fact that the values are repressed in the nurses ' practice and that this , together with insufficient time for clinical supervision and reflection , can be the basic reason for moral distress .
