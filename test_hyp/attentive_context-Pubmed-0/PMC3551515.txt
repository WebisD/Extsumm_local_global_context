we present a case of an 8 year - old girl with a nine - month history of intermittent vomiting and no history of prior surgery and review the embryology and radiologic findings of this entity using different imaging modalities .
congenital anomalous bands resulting in proximal jejunal obstruction are a rare entity that should be considered in the differential in patients with clinical signs of obstruction and no prior history of abdominal surgery .
an 8 year - old girl with a past medical history of constipation presented with a history of vomiting for nine months .
external compression of the proximal jejunum by an anomalous band should be included in the differential diagnosis of obstruction of the distal duodenum or duodeno - jejunal junction for patients without previous history of surgery , especially when ugi barium examination shows normal duodenal rotation and duodeno - jejunal fixation .
congenital causes of intestinal obstruction include duodenal atresia , malrotation , duodenal obstruction from ladd bands , other congenital bands , superior mesentery artery syndrome , enteric duplications as well as several other entities .
, discovered a band running from the antimesenteric wall of the proximal jejunum just distal to the treitz 's ligament to the root of the mesentery . the anomalous congenital band in that case was considered to be the remnant of ventral mesentery that failed to resorb completely . in both our case and the case described by liu et al .
