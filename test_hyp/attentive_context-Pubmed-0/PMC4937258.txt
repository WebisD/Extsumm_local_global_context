cystatin c is a 13.3kda protein , well known and commonly used in the clinic as a marker of kidney function.1 it is also involved in extracellular matrix remodeling2 and may be directly associated with the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ascvd).3 , 4 there is a wellestablished relation between chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) and ascvd,5 , 6 , 7 which is evident even in patients with only mild renal impairment,8 and a lowered glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) is a risk factor for incident ascvd.9 like ascvd , ckd is a complex disease derived from a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors.10 previous studies have estimated the heritability of gfr in the range between 0.36 and 0.82,11 , 12 which indicates that additive genetic effects explain 30% to 80% of the interindividual variation of gfr .
the association between cystatin c level and allcause mortality was first reported by shlipak et  al,22 and the prognostic value of cystatin c for cardiovascular morbidity as a biomarker for ckd has also been thoroughly investigated.23 , 24 , 25 , 26 thus , the finding of the current study that cystatin c is superior to creatinine for prediction of incident ascvd confirms findings from previous populationbased studies.27 , 28 , 29 however , since our study is the first of this topic in a twin cohort , it allows us to control for genetic confounding .
