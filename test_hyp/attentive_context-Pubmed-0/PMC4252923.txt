within the limitations of this study , we can conclude that when the inferior alveolar nerve block fails to provide profound pulpal anesthesia , the x - tip system using 4% articaine , was successful in achieving pulpal anesthesia in mandibular posterior teeth of patients presenting with irreversible pulpitis .
the purpose of the study was to evaluate the anesthetic efficacy of x - tip intraosseous injection in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth , using 4% articaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline as local anesthetic when the conventional inferior alveolar nerve block proved ineffective .
supplemental intraosseous injection with x - tip using 4% articaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline enabled soothing , swift , and sound anesthesia .
the purpose of the study was to evaluate the anesthetic efficacy of x - tip intraosseous injection in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth , using 4% articaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline as local anesthetic when the conventional inferior alveolar nerve block proved ineffective .
thirty patients , 15 males and 15 females 15 - 53 years of age with a diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis of mandibular posterior teeth were included in this study .
the results of this study shows that supplemental x - tip intraosseous injection helps in achieving successful pulpal anesthesia in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis .
