although the study has a number of limitations the relaxation program appears to be a promising alternative to traditional treatment of akathisia .
we tested a structured relaxation program on nine patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia suffering from akathisia .
a wilcoxon signed ranks test revealed a significant reduction in bas score from baseline to endpoint ( p = 0.026 ; z = 2.232 ) and a highly significant reduction from baseline to follow - up ( p = 0.008 ; z = 2.636 ) .
all patients were rated on barnes akathisia scale ( bas ) before the relaxation program , immediately after and again one week later .
akathisia ( inability to sit still ) is a movement disorder characterized by objective movements and restlessness and/or distress , which is common among patients under - going treatment with psychotropic drugs .
the structured relaxation program appeared to be well accepted and to be associated with a notable reduction in the severity of symptoms of akathisia in this group of patients with chronic schizophrenia , treated with antipsychotic drugs .
the mean bas score was before the relaxation 3.3 which reduced to 1.4 immediately after to finally 1.0 a week later .
