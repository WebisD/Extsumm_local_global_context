lower ffr values remained an independent predictor in the acs group , but not the non - acs group of cv death , mi , or dli ( hr , 1.07 ; 95% ci , 1.02 to 1.11 ; interaction , p=0.08 ) , mi or dli ( hr , 1.08 ; 95% ci , 1.03 to 1.13 ; interaction , p=0.026 ) , and dlf ( hr , 1.11 ; 95% ci , 1.05 to 1.17 ; interaction , p=0.005 ) .
lower ffr values were associated with a significantly higher rate of cv death , mi or dli ( hazard ratio [ hr ] , 1.08 per 0.01 decrease ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.03 to 1.12 ) , mi or dli ( hr , 1.09 ; 95% ci , 1.04 to 1.14 ) , dlf ( hr , 1.12 ; 95% ci , 1.06 to 1.18 ) , mi ( hr , 1.07 ; 95% ci , 1.00 to 1.14 ) , and dli ( hr , 1.12 ; 95% ci , 1.06 to 1.18 ) .
for patients with intermediate severity coronary lesions that are deferred revascularization in the setting of acs based on ffr > 0.80 , lower ffr values are associated with a significantly higher rate of adverse cardiac events .
