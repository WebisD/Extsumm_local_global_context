the aim of the current study was to evaluate the patients ' characteristics , risk factors , complications , and visual outcome of traumatic wound dehiscence after keratoplasty .
this is a retrospective case series that included 20 eyes of 20 patients who had undergone a keratoplasty procedure followed by traumatic wound dehiscence .
mean duration between the time of previous keratoplasty and the trauma was 15.5  10.7 months ( range from 2 to 35 months ) .
those 20 patients represent around 4% of the total number of keratoplasty patients ' records scanned during the period between 2010 and 2014 .
the data recorded included the type of the keratoplasty procedure , the indication for the keratoplasty , sex , age at the time of the trauma , type of the trauma , the time interval between the previous keratoplasty and the trauma , size of the wound dehiscence , anterior segment complications , posterior segment complications , and visual outcome .
ten cases ( 50% ) of traumatic wound dehiscence occurred during the first year following the keratoplasty procedure , four cases ( 20% ) occurred during the second year , and six cases ( 30% ) occurred during the third year ( p < 0.05 ) .
