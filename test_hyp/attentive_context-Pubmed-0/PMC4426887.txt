( 2010 ) argues that scientific assessments in the field of ecosystem services and biodiversity should aim at evaluating the impacts of specific ( combinations of ) measures rather than focus on broad overarching scenarios .
1interactions between land use and the vulnerability / damage as result of changes in flood occurrence interactions between land use and the vulnerability / damage as result of changes in flood occurrence this paper intends to take such an approach by analyzing the land use consequences of a policy package of adaptation measures for the territory of the european union .
land use and land use planning play a critical role in the evaluation of possible strategies to adapt to the consequences of climate change and increased flooding in particular ( fig .  1 ) .
however , during the specification an improved mutual understanding of the possible implications of the measures as well as an understanding of the capacities and limitations of assessment models to evaluate such measures was obtained .
this paper presented a quantitative approach to analyze this mutual interaction between climate adaptation measures and other policy objectives in the context of a multi - scale analysis of land use dynamics .
