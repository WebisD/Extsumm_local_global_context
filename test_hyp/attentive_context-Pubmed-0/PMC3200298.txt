we report the case of a 76-year - old woman who underwent a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy for a sigmoid tumour . the patient was discharged in good general conditions and with open alvus on the 7th postoperative day .
when in laparoscopic surgery a resolution of postoperative ileus after a period of 714 days of medical therapy and observation is not obtained , a differential diagnosis between postoperative ileus and pathologic postoperative occlusions ( trocar site hernia , adhesions ) is to be assessed . in these patients observation alone
trocar site hernia ( tsh ) is defined as an incisional hernia which occurs after minimally invasive surgery on the trocar incision site ; some authors also define this condition as a port site hernia . in 2004
because of the clinical , us and radiological signs of obstruction , the patient underwent an emergency explorative laparotomy which showed a small bowel herniation through the trocar incision site in the left upper quadrant ( figure 1 ) ; the intestinal loop appeared necrotic and had to be resected , and the hernia orifice was repaired .
could be not enough appropriated to perform a well - timed diagnosis , making abdominal ct still play a key role for   a right differential diagnosis .
