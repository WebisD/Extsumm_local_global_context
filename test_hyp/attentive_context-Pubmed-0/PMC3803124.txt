we hypothesized that the fetal anomaly rate in women with hiv - infection is as low as in all other pregnancies ( 35% )   .
, we confirm the low fetal malformation rate of 4.5% in women living with hiv .
the nuchal translucency was measured in 67 ( 20.3% ) of the 330 cases ( nt median 1.22  mm ( range 0.63  mm ) ) . a multivariate analysis for factors influencing a woman having an early anomaly scan ( table 3 ) showed that african ethnicity and first diagnosis of hiv during the ongoing pregnancy were factors which significantly could be related to not having early prenatal ultrasound screening ( figure 1 ) .  
three categories were used : very preterm delivery ( 24 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks of gestation ) , preterm delivery ( 34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks of gestation ) , and term delivery ( 37 weeks of gestation ) .  
hiv - positive pregnant women who presented in our tertiary referral center between january 1 , 2002 and december 31 , 2012 were included in this retrospective cohort study .  
pregnant hiv - positive women usually have a combined antenatal care in a tertiary referral center and with their own gynaecologists .   as well as the prevalence of prenatal ultrasound screening , prenatal , and postnatal finding was recorded .
