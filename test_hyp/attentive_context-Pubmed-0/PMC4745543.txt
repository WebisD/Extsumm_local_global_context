quality characteristics for chapatti revealed that dough handling and puffing of bran enriched chapattis prepared by 5 and 10% level of bran supplementation did not vary significantly .
all types of bran enriched chapattis except rice bran enriched chapattis showed nonsticky behavior during dough handling .
rice bran enriched chapatti recorded maximum moisture ( % ) , water activity , and free fatty acids ( % ) . with increase in level of supplementation , moisture , water activity , and free fatty acids increased .
a value of wheat , rice , oat , and bran in combination was 4.18 , 5.24 , 4.71 , and 4.28 , respectively .
the l value of 66.83 , 61.59 , and 61.14 was observed at 0 , 5 , and 10% level of supplementation , which means slightly lower brightness at higher levels of supplementation .
the pooled scores obtained by the various bran enriched levels of chapattis for appearance , color , texture , and flavor were 7.92 , 7.18 , 7.68 , and 8.10 for wheat bran , rice bran , oat bran , and bran in combination enriched chapattis , respectively .
cutting force increased due to presence of more fibres at higher enrichment levels . at 0 , 5 , and 10 percent level of supplementation , the corresponding cutting force ( n ) was 5.25 , 5.91 , and 5.97  n , respectively .
