in proof - of - concept studies for 
 species - specific killing , these conjugates selectively kill e. coli in the presence of staphylococcus aureus , a gram - positive organism that is more susceptible to the parent 
 -lactams .
these studies support the notion that native siderophore 
 platforms provide an effective means to target molecular cargo to 
 siderophore - utilizing organisms and to hijack siderophore 
 uptake machinery to deliver cargos , including antibiotics , across 
 the outer membrane permeability barrier of gram - negative microbes .
our investigations of ent - amp / amx establish the following : 
 ( i ) ent - amp / amx provide up to 1000-fold enhanced antibacterial activity 
 against e. coli strains ; ( ii ) ent - amp / amx are transported 
 into e. coli by fepa and potentially other catecholate 
 siderophore receptors ( iron , iha ) employed by pathogenic ctf073 
 and uti98 ; ( iii ) ent - amp / amx are captured by pbps in the periplasm , 
 which results in pbp inhibition and cell death ; ( iv ) selective killing 
 of e. coli in the presence of less susceptible organisms 
 such as s. aureus is achieved because of the enterobactin 
 scaffold ; ( v ) ent - amp / amx exhibit negligible cytotoxicity to human 
 t84 intestinal epithelial cells ; and ( vi ) although lcn2 has the ability 
 to bind ent - amp / amx , this siderophore - scavenging protein prefers 
 to capture native ent . in total
