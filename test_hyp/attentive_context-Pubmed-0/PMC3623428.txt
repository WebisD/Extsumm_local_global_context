this study was conducted to study the relationship of vitamin d deficiency and insufficiency with insulin resistance in obese children and adolescents and the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency among children living in the metropolitan area of istanbul , turkey .
we found significant association between the degree of obesity and some biochemical parameters with insulin resistance , but different levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin d status among obese children were not an independent predictor of insulin resistance .
the correlation of vitamin d levels with insulin resistance in the obese group was evaluated with homa - ir .
insulin resistance values were higher in obese subjects compared with the healthy , vitamin - d - sufficient , age- and gender - matched children and adolescents . in order to determine the role of 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in obese children
the homa - ir levels of the obese subjects who were vitamin d deficient and insufficient did not statistically differ from those with vitamin - d - sufficient ones ( p = 0.72 ) ( table 3 ) . 

subjects of the obese group had significantly higher waist circumference sds ( 0.027 ) , bmi ( p < 0.001 ) , bmi sds ( p > 0.001 ) , and bmi percentage ( p > 0.001 ) compared with the control group ( table 1 ) . 
 table 2 presents the biochemical characteristics of all subjects . compared with the nonobese subjects , obese subjects had higher fasting insulin , homa - ir , serum alt , triglyceride , and total and ldl - cholesterol levels .
