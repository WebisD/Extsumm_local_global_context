the slox-1 levels were significantly higher in nongravidity group than pregnancy followed by delivery group ( 0.78  0.13  ng / ml and 0.52  0.18  ng / ml , resp . ,
the smoker subjects in group 1 had 3.5  1.3 pack - year history of smoking , and smoker subjects in group 2 had 5.0  2.1 pack - year history of smoking ( p = 0.1 ) .
was positively related and number of gravity was negatively related with slox-1 levels ( for age p = 0.011 , beta = 0.169 , t = 2,589 for parous p
sixty - eight subjects with pregnancy followed by delivery ( group 1 ) and 57 subjects with nongravidity ( group 2 ) were included in this study .
we conclude that pregnancy followed by delivery may delay the progress of arteriosclerosis and its clinical manifestations in women of reproductive age .
the mean age of first menarche was 12.1  2.3 years in pregnancy followed by delivery group and 11.9  1.9 years in nongravidity group ( p = 0.5 ) .
the levels of total - c , ldl - c , hdl - c , and triglyceride were also similar between the two groups ( table 1 ) .
