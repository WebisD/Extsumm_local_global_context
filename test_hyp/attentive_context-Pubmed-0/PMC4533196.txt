the technical quality of preclinical molar rcts performed by undergraduate dental students using step - back technique and cold lateral condensation was considered to be acceptable in 35.6% of the cases . when gg drills were used along with k - files , the technical quality of rcts was enhanced .
in addition , the effect of gg drills use on the final quality of the performed rcts was evaluated .
no relationship was found between the type of instrument used and the length ( p = 0.499 ) and taper of fillings ( p = 0.238 ) . on the other hand , the mann 
table 3 shows the length , density and taper of rcts based on the type of instrument used ( whether gg drills were used ) .
the selected exposure environments ( i.e. kvp , ma and exposure time ) were based on a pilot exposure prior to the final imaging confirmation of an endodontist and a maxillofacial radiologist . in the present study , a total of 146 images including 64 of maxillary molars and 82 of mandibular molars ( from two directions )
a significant relationship was found between the type of teeth ( maxillary or mandibular ) and the length of fillings , with more number of under - fillings in mandibular root canals ( p = 0.001 ) .
