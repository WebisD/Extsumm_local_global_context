since a subset of these patients are not ideal candidates for radical surgery because of medical co - morbidities , advanced age , and obesity , the preoperative radiation therapy followed by simple hysterectomy may be a better option .
two patients with high grade pathology ( one each with serous and clear cell histology ) also received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery . at a median follow up of 37 months ( 1 - 91 months )
twelve women clinically diagnosed with clinical stage ii endometrial carcinoma from 1999 - 2010 were treated with preoperative radiation therapy .
, one patient has developed recurrence at the vaginal apex six months after completing initial therapy and is alive with the disease at 91 months , while another developed a lung recurrence at 28 months .
complete pathological response ( pcr ) was seen in two patients ( 17% ) while five patients ( 42% ) had only microscopic residual disease confined to either the endometrium or cervical glands .
ours is the first published series using hdr and shows the hdr fractionation schedule , as done in our series , is well tolerated and would be an option for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy .
