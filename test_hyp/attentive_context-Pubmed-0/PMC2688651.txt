in this study we evaluated the extent to which [ f]fdg pet imaging can accurately characterize the antitumor activity of enzastaurin in two different mouse xenograft tumor models .
our study implies that [ f]fdg pet imaging will be useful only in a select type of tumors and perhaps detect antitumor activity only for a limited number of drugs .
recently , enzastaurin has shown antitumor activity in xenograft models of the colorectal cancer cell line hct116 and in the glioblastoma cell line u87 mg .   while enzastaurin was designed as a selective pkc-   inhibitor , recent studies suggest that its antitumor activity is modulated by activation of gsk-3 and the pi3k / akt pathway .  
in addition to suv , we also used tumor / muscle ratio to determine the metabolic effect of enzastaurin in tumors .  
imaging    techniques play an important role in the diagnosis , staging , and follow - up of cancer patients .   while standard imaging techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , are based on differences in the anatomical structure of the tissues , positron emission tomography ( pet )
, we also found that suv correlated with u87 mg tumor size as measured by ct ( figure 1(b ) ) .   based on these preliminary observations of initial tumor growth , we elected to use both tumor cell lines to evaluate enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes as detected by [ f]fdg uptake .
