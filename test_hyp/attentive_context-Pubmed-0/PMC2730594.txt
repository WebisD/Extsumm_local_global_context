brain structure segmentation is the apportionment of brain tissue into gray matter and white matter , based on the appearance of tissue in images produced by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
the two adaptations are : ( 1 ) a function g(i ) is able to characterize the statistical properties of the data to achieve better segmentation results , and ( 2 ) the tuning weights in(out ) are able to segment brain tissues in a probabilistic fashion and achieve three - tissue segmentation .
the whole procedure moreover includes the determination of optimal flip angles in achieving the balance between accuracy and efficiency , and joint registration of flip angle images and generation of brain mask .
radiofrequency ( rf)-inhomogeneity is another unavoidable problem encountered in mr imaging . the nonuniform distribution of the rf field can cause the resulting images to have low contrast and inhomogeneous intensity , which makes quantitative description and segmentation of the image difficult .
we propose a novel method to jointly segment a t1-map and calibrate rf - inhomogeneity , and in section 5 we show the results of registering the flip angle images , determining optimal flip angles , and segmenting the t1-maps .
