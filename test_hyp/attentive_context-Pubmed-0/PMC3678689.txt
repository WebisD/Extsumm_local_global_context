weight of animals of the control and test groups weight and length of femur bones of the control and test groups the organ - somatic index in the tg and cg was 0.0025  0.008 and 0.0033  0.004 respectively , with a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0126 ) .
the mean femur bone concentration ( mg / l ) of zn , p , ca , na , and k were significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) in the tg compared to the cg [ table 3 ] .
group i served as the control group ( cg ) , while group ii served as test group ( tg ) .
as there are no clinical studies , it is important therefore to investigate the effect of c. chalk on the morphometry and mineralization of the bone in experimental animals with the aim of relating the findings to human situation , hence this study was conducted .
the mean initial body weights ( g ) of the tg animals were significantly lower ( p < 0.0006 ) compared with the cg , while the mean final body weights of the tg animals were also significantly lower ( p < 0.0008 ) compared with the cg . the mean change in body weight of the animals in the tg and cg were 52.17 g ( 47% ) and 66.29 g ( 48.6% ) , respectively [ table 1 ] .
