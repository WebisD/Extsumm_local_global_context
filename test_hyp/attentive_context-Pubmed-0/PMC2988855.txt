we report a case of a macular hole caused by accidental exposure to an nd : yag q - switched laser .
the preoperative visual acuity was 20/60 , which may explain the good improvement of visual acuity of 20/20 after 24 months of postoperative follow - up .
the q - switched nd : yag laser may cause photodisruption at the injury site , which occasionally results in a macular hole .
vitrectomy with gas tamponade has been shown to improve the visual acuity in patients with q - switched nd : yag laser - induced macular holes   .
we used the following parameters : a fixation target consisting of a single cross , 2 in diameter ; a white , monochromatic background at 4 asb ( apostilb ) , a stimulus size goldman iii , with projection time of 200 ms ; a customized radial grid of 33 stimuli covering 20 ( centered onto the fovea ) .
surgical intervention was advised in our case because of the unlikely possibility of spontaneous closure due to the size of the macular hole ( approximately 820 m in diameter ) ( fig .
the improvement in the visual function includes not only visual acuity but also retinal sensitivity and fixation stability that are obtained by using mp1-microperimeter .
