these results reveal mif as a key regulator of proinflammatory function and m and dc activation in t1 dm .
we show for the first time a role of mif in promoting costimulatory molecule expression in m and dc in t1 dm .
studies in nod mice or mice treated with multiple low doses of stz ( despite the pathogenic differences between these models ) have shown that pancreatic  cell destruction results from the toxic effect of free radicals ( o2 , h2o2 , and nitric oxide ) and inflammatory cytokines released by activated m and t cells   .
the activities of mif may reside at the levels of both the inductive and effector phases of the inflammatory response attributed to antigen - presenting cells . here , we analyzed the influence of mif on m and dc activation using an autoimmune diabetes model in which multiple low doses of stz were administered to mif/ and wild - type ( wt ) mice ( mif/stz and wtstz , resp . ) in the balb / c genetic background .
we further demonstrate that , in addition to regulating m and dc activation in t1 dm , m isolated from t1 dm mif/ mice exhibit reduced t cell activation . here
