in this study , we assessed the characteristic features of intracranial filling in bd patients  delay and weakness of cerebrovascular opacification .
, we performed a dynamic evaluation of contrast enhancement of the cerebral and extracranial arteries in patients with bd and control subjects with the use of the 40-s series of ctp scans .
baseline density for cerebral and extracranial arteries was significantly higher in bd patients in comparison to the control group ( 60.5 vs. 41.5  hu ( hounsfield unit ) ;
it led to the conclusion that delayed and weak opacification of cerebral arteries do not necessarily mean the presence of cerebral perfusion , thus does not preclude diagnosis of bd .
the intensity of peak enhancement in cerebral arteries in relation to extracranial arteries expressed as c / e peak ratio appeared to be significantly lower in bd patients in comparison to the control group ( 0.31 vs. 0.87 ; p  <  0.0001 ) ( see fig . 
we found significantly longer time to peak enhancement in cerebral arteries in bd patients than in controls ( median , 32 vs. 21  s ; p  < 
we also confronted stasis filling pattern with ctp findings to assess the relevance of this phenomenon to brain perfusion .
