this is the first study to determine the polymorphism of the fshr core promoter at position 29 , alone and in combination with the snp   at codon 680 in exon 10 ,   and to evaluate the possible role of these two fshr snps on serum levels of fsh in southeast turkey .
(  = 6.67 , p < .05 ) ,    for genotype asn - ser between proven fathers and severe oligozoospermic groups (  = 5.18 , p < .05 ) ,    for genotype asn - ser between nonobstructive azoospermic and severe oligozoospermic (  = 15.36 , p < .001 ) , and for genotype ser - ser between nonobstructive azoospermic and severe oligozoospermic groups (  = 11.86 , p < .05 ) . to assess whether the polymorphism at 680 influences fsh levels , we compared fsh concentrations among genotypes .
the impact of 29  snp , alone or in combination with exon 10  snps , is less clear   but does not seem to influence the clinical parameters or plasma fsh concentrations both in women and men   .
the interaction   between follicle - stimulating   hormone ( fsh ) and the fsh receptor ( fshr ) is essential for normal oogenesis and spermatogenesis   . in the male ,
