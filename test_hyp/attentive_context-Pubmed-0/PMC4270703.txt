ureteric injury from herniorrhaphy is unusual . we present a case of ureteric injury complicating an inguinal herniorrhaphy for a huge right inguino - scrotal hernia .
ureteric injury following herniorrhaphy is rare .this is probably the first reported case from nigeria .
complete inguinal hernia may contain the lower urinary tract especially if the patient presents with luts .
we present a 66-year - old male farmer with right inguino - scrotal swelling noticed 10 years earlier which became irreducible 2 years prior to presentation .
preoperative radiological evaluation is advised in such cases to avoid injury to the ureter and/or bladder .
case reports are important as they describe rare clinical conditions , highlight uncommon challenges or therapeutic adaptations .
groin hernia surgery demands sound knowledge of the anatomy of the region as it does the principles of good perioperative care .
the resultant septicemia from the latter coupled with the metabolic response to surgery in an already challenged cardio - pulmonary system could be enough to tip him into sirs and finally death from multiple organ failure .
surgery lasted about 3 h. he developed features of systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) which progressed to multiple organ failure culminating in death by the fourth day postsurgery .
