this technology is simple and noninvasive , and is ideally suited for use in the emergency room and the trauma bay .
the esophageal or sublingual pco2 gap may prove to be a useful endpoint for the resuscitation of trauma victims .
both ivatury and colleagues and kirton and coworkers have demonstrated that gastric intramucosal ph correlates well with the degree of injury and that optimizing the gastric intramucosal ph in the first 24 hours following trauma is associated with a reduction in the incidence of organ failure and death .
while flow to the brain and the myocardium is preserved in patients with ' compensated shock ' , splanchnic and renal perfusion may be seriously compromised .
the assessment of intravascular volume and the adequacy of volume resuscitation are among the most difficult clinical challenges .
used the central venous oxygen saturation as the endpoint of resuscitation in the intervention group , while treatment in the control group was guided by standard clinical endpoints including the central venous pressure .
the base excess ( be ) has become the standard endpoint of resuscitation in trauma patients .
increased mucosal permeability has been strongly associated with the development of the multiorgan dysfunction syndrome .
