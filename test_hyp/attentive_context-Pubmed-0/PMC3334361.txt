ev is relatively rare in hiv - infected adults but appears to be frequent in vertically - infected children , and close dermatological surveillance for potential skin malignancy is required .
it is a disfiguring condition and difficult to treat because no impact on the progression of skin disease has been observed after the administration of cart .
this is particularly important among this group of children with longstanding immune deficiency and high levels of sun exposure . in summary , we describe 4 hiv - infected adolescents with ev - like lesions .
hpv 1 and 2 , classically associated with plantar warts , were also isolated in skin biopsies from our patients , together with hpv 5 , commonly found in patients with congenital ev .
we describe acquired ev in 4 adolescents with longstanding , untreated vertically acquired hiv infection .
only 18 cases of hiv - associated ev have been reported , and only 2 described congenital hiv and ev   .
preliminary results suggest that among long - term survivors of vertically - acquired hiv , this might be a common clinical hpv phenotype .
classical ev is associated with a high risk of lesional transformation to squamous cell carcinoma , occurring in up to 70% of cases
