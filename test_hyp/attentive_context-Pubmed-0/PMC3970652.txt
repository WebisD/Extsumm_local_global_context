finally , we recommend that the serological diagnosis of 
 t. cruzi 
 infection in the amazon region should be made using at least two different techniques , e.g. , immunofluorescence and elisa and confirmed by western blot analysis when possible .
the numbers of blood samples collected on filter paper , along with the percentage of positivity for 
 t. cruzi 
 infection , varied according to the number of people living in the area and their degree of exposure to infection in rural areas , especially in relation to piassava harvesters and their families .
the prevalence of serological positivity in samples collected on filter paper gradually increased after the age of 15 years , precisely when adolescents ( especially males ) started to be involved in piassava harvesting and after the age of 20 years among women , when as wives would accompany their husbands to the piassava plantations (

of the 178 serum samples for which the immunofluorescence was considered doubtful , 89 ( 50% ) were seronegative in all three confirmatory reactions , 79 ( 44.4% ) were considered to be serodivergent 
 , 
 with only one positive reaction out of the three reactions , and only 10 ( 5.6% ) were considered to be seropositive , with two or three positive reactions (

 ) . in summary , of the 137 samples that were positive in the screening serological tests , only 33 ( 24.1% ) were positive in the confirmatory tests , while only 10 ( 5.6% ) of the 178 samples that were doubtful in the screening test were positive in the confirmatory test , as shown in
