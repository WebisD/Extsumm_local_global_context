the overall association of the mets with crp is predominantly driven by the low hdl cholesterol feature , a paramount predictor of vascular events .
thus , crp is strongly associated with the mets but not with angiographically diagnosed coronary atherosclerosis .
significant cad at angiography was present in 564 patients ( 55.8% ) ; its prevalence was higher in patients with mets than in subjects without mets ( 59.5 vs. 52.8% ; p = 0.034 ) ; adjustment for age , sex , ldl cholesterol , smoking , cardiovascular medications ( statins , aspirin , ace inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blocking agents and -blocking agents ) , and crp confirmed this result , with an odds ratio ( or ) of 1.49 ( 95% ci 1.121.98 ; p = 0.007 ) for mets patients . the low hdl cholesterol ( or 1.57 [ 95% ci 1.112.22 ] ; p = 0.011 ) and the high - glucose traits ( 1.33  
specifically , the overall association of the mets with crp is driven by the low hdl cholesterol feature .
from our data , we conclude that among angiographied coronary patients crp is strongly associated with the mets but not with angiographically characterized coronary atherosclerosis .
