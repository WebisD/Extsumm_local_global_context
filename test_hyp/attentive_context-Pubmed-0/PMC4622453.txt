although about two - thirds of patients with epilepsy ( pwe ) treated with antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) reach seizure - freedom , about one - third remains drug - resistant to the current therapies.1 despite the introduction of new aeds with a better pharmacokinetic and safety profile compared to old generation aeds , today , one of the major causes of failure of antiepileptic treatment is poor adherence often due to occurrence of adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) , leading up to 25% of patients to discontinue treatment before the achievement of effective doses and with a consequent increase of health care costs.2,3 during the last 25 years , many efforts have been directed to the development of new aeds with different mechanisms of action able to reduce brain hyperexcitability ; recently considerable interest has been focused on synaptic vesicle protein 2a ( sv2a ) and its role as a target for aeds.4 the first drug of this new class approved for epilepsy is levetiracetam ( lev ) , and from this lead compound , several racetam analogs have been synthesized.5 based on target - drug program , brivaracetam ( brv ) ( 2s)-2-[(4r)-2-oxo-4-propylpyrro - lidinyl]butanamide , an n - propyl analog of lev has been identified and has entered clinical trials for pwe;6 it is an sv2a ligand with high selectivity and a 1030-fold higher potency , depending on the experimental conditions , when compared to lev.7,8 the purpose of this review is to present updated data available on the pharmacology , efficacy , and tolerability of brv .
