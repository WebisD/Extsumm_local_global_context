we report a case of a 15-year - old boy with a fatal systemic adv infection .
he complained of fever and right shoulder pain 4 days after completing the reinduction chemotherapy . in spite of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal therapy ,
he had received reinduction chemotherapy for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia under continuing antifungal therapy for previously diagnosed fungal pneumonia .
a multiplex polymerase chain reaction test for respiratory viruses was positive for adv in a blood sample , and a urine culture was positive for adv .
he received oral ribavirin , intravenous immunoglobulin , and intravenous cidofovir therapy ; however , he eventually died . relapsed leukemia , concurrent fungal pneumonia , and delayed cidofovir administration were considered the cause of the grave outcome in this patient .
although adenovirus ( adv ) infection usually causes self - limiting respiratory disorders in immune competent children ; severe and systemic adv infection in children undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia has been continuously reported .
adv may cause severe infections not only in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients , but also in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia .
nevertheless , there has been no consensus on risk factors and treatment strategies for severe adv infection in children undergoing chemotherapy .
