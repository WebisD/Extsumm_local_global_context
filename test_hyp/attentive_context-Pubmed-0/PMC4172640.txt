2007 ) . taking the latest data from the fields of nutrigenomics into consideration , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of long - term ( 14 months ) use of biologically active substances - enriched diet ( base - diet ) containing the mixture of polyphenolic compounds , -carotene , probiotics and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on transcriptomic profile of rats liver .
5expression of gpx1 , irf1 and prodh genes in livers of control rats and rats fed with base - diet measured using dna microarrays and real - time pcr ( normalized vs. actb ) expression of gpx1 , irf1 and prodh genes in livers of control rats and rats fed with base - diet measured using dna microarrays and real - time pcr ( normalized vs. actb )
therefore , the results indicating the strong influence of base - diet on genes involved in the gonadotrope cell activation pathway may also suggest the strong impact of base - diet on the aging process by the regulation of gnrh - dependent cells .
our previous study has shown that base - diet , which was enriched with the mixture of polyphenols , beta - carotene , probiotics and polyunsaturated fatty acid , prevented from hepatic and systemic oxidative damage and was able to attenuate the development of some senile features in adult and old rats ( oszkiel et al .
