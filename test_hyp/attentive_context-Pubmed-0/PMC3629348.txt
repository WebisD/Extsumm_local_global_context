therefore , an mri should be taken when there is clinical suspicion of infection in order to not miss the complications after interventional procedures , even if the laboratory findings were normal .
there has been a reported case of spondylodiscitis following cervical nucleoplasty : in theat case , the complication was detected 3 weeks after the procedure . in our case ,
in addition , fever was a typical symptom associated with this infection . in our case ,
a 33-year - old male ( height 172.3 cm and weight 61.5 kg ) visited our pain clinic due to neck pain radiating to both shoulders , which started 3 years ago .
mri is considered to be the most sensitive and specific method , 93% and 97% , as reported . furthermore , mri is the gold standard for diagnosing spondylodiscitis . in conclusion ,
we postulate that the pathogen may be sequestrated from the blood stream completely , therefore , systemic inflammatory changes were not triggered , or the immunity of this patient ( 33 year - old man ) was strong enough to overcome the dispersion of the pathogen . for detecting postoperative discitis , mri is the imaging method of choice , with its high sensitivity and specificity .
