the goal of the present study is to assess the perception of family medicine pcps in a university based family medicine network surrounding the barriers of preventing and treating obesity in the young child and to analyze pcps reported behaviors at well - child checks . in addition
, the present study allows for a comparison of attitudes and practice between family medicine pcps and pediatric pcps who participated in an earlier study using a similar survey .
further study is needed to examine actual obesity prevention and treatment guidelines in clinical practice and to discern the specifics , feasibility , and benefits of incorporating additional counseling into routine well - child care .
the barriers identified were in areas that were inconsistently addressed in practice , specifically prior to the two - year well - child check . despite the apparent lack of congruence between the identified barriers and the actions by pcps in clinical practice ,
a major finding of the current study involved the relative importance pcps ascribe to perceived barriers in treating obesity .
surveys were completed by 56 of the 78 family medicine pcps ( 41 family medicine physicians , 8 physician assistants , and 7 nurse practitioners ) at the 11 participating clinics , for a 72% response rate .
