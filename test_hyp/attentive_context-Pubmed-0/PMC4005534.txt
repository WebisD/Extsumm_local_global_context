, the present study demonstrated that the lymphocytes of patients who are 
 chronically infected with hbv or hcv exhibit greater chromosomal instability , 
 characterised by the presence of mn , npbs and nbuds .
, we demonstrated that the lymphocytes of hbv - infected patients and 
 hcv - infected patients exhibited an increased frequency of mn compared with lymphocytes 
 from healthy , non - infected individuals .
considering the hbv - infected patients and the hcv - infected patients separately , the 
 numbers of mn in the hbv - infected patients ( 7.18  3.57 ) and hcv - infected patients ( 6.78 
  2.80 ) were significantly higher than in the non - infected group ( 4.41  2.15 ) ( p < 
 0.0001 ) . the numbers of npbs and nbuds in the hbv - infected patients ( 3.27  2.40 and 
 4.71  2.79 , respectively ) and in patients infected with hcv ( 2.09  1.33 and 4.38  
 3.28 , respectively ) were increased relative to those of the control group ( 1.15  0.97 
 and 2.98  1.31 , respectively ) .
together with our results , 
 these data suggest that the chromosomal instability in lymphocytes that results from hbv 
 infection ( and likely also from chronic hcv infection ) is characterised by the presence 
 of dicentric chromosomes and gene amplification . in this study ,
