in this case study , we report a very rare manifestation of cmv disease , a cutaneous ulcers , in a live related renal transplant recipient .
, we report an unusual case of a renal alograft recipient who developed ulcers over the right axilla , scrotum and penile skin not responding to antibiotics , and the skin biopsies from the axillary and scrotal ulcers revealed several enlarged endothelial cells of the dermal blood vessels containing intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions positive for cmv antigen on immunohistochemistry .
cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) is a common viral infection in renal transplant recipients , affecting more than 50% of recipients of major organ transplants .
the most common clinical presentation is a viral syndrome characterized by fever , leucopenia , thrombocytopenia , atypical lymphocytosis and other well - documented manifestations including pneumonia , liver dysfunction and gastrointestinal disease .
skin biopsy may be of help in the prompt diagnosis and treatment of cmv skin ulcers .
a 52-year - old , live related renal allograft recipient , after a 2.5-month post - transplant period , presented with a history of vesicular eruptions over the right axilla , scrotum and penile skin which later developed into ulcers ( figure 1 ) . both the donor and the recipient were cmv immunoglobulin g ( igg ) antibody positive and cmv igm antibody negative before transplantation .
