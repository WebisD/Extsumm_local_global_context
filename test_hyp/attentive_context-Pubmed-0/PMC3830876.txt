this review focuses on the role of emps in angiogenesis , coagulation , and inflammation during age - related vascular diseases and the contribution of estrogen to these diseases .
endothelial microparticles , as pleiotropic factors , play a role in both physiological and pathological conditions and thus may contribute to regulation of vascular homeostasis .
vascular aging with impairment of endothelial cell function leads to altered angiogenesis , a key factor in the etiology of various cardiovascular disorders .
vascular diseases are among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality , and both number and severity of morbid vascular conditions increase with age . regulations of angiogenesis , coagulation , and inflammation are very important issues in vascular biology , both in normal physiology and pathology .
emps not only reflect the stage of disease but also play a causative role in the development of various vascular diseases .
new insights into endothelial dysfunction and alterations in angiogenesis are emerging from studies of vascular microparticles , particularly endothelial microparticles in elderly populations .
furthermore , circulating emps show great promise not only as biomarkers in the diagnostics of vascular diseases but also as a target for the treatment of these disorders , especially in elderly patients .
