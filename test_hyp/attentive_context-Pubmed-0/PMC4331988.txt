the overall results of this study suggest that condurango 30c has more apoptosis - inducing ability than condurango 6c , which is consistent with the claim made in the homeopathic doctrine .
results showed up - regulation and downregulation of bax and bcl2 , respectively , at 18 hours in response to both drug treatments as compared to drug - untreated cells ( fig .
present findings would demonstrate that exposure of nsclc- h460 cells to ic50 doses of both condurango 6c and 30c for 48 hours resulted in apoptotic cell - death .
first , do the two potentized homeopathic drugs , condurango 6c and 30c show any ability to induce apoptosis in nsclc , and do they act via reactive oxygen species ( ros ) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential ( mmp)-depolarization .
an increased expression of cytochrome - c was found in response to drugs at 24 hour of treatment ( fig .
in fact , our earlier in vivo findings on benzo[a ] pyrene - induced lung cancer in rats   also convincingly demonstrated the ameliorative effect of condurango 30c , for which we tried to verify that the potentized remedy showed anti - cancer potential in nsclc cells .
