in the treatment of class ii div.1 malocclusion , omis can provide less anchorage loss , mesial - in rotation of the maxillary posterior teeth , and less arch dimension change than does conventional anchorage during en - masse retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth .
therefore , the purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the effect of conventional and omi anchorage on tooth movement and arch dimension change of the maxillary dentition in class ii div.1 patients treated with extraction of the maxillary first premolars and the mandibular second premolars and sliding mechanics using superimposition of 3d virtual maxillary models pre- and post - orthodontic treatment .
although mxp2 , mxm1 , and mxm2 did not show significant changes in inclination , they showed mesial tipping ( 4.0 , p < 0.01 ; 5.2 , p < 0.01 ; 6.7 , p < 0.001 ) and mesial - in rotation ( 5.1 , p < 0.001 ; 3.3 , p < 0.001 ; 3.0 , p < 0.01 )
although mxp2 , mxm1 , and mxm2 did not show significant changes in inclination , they showed mesial tipping ( 3.1 , p < 0.01 ; 2.5 , p < 0.01 ; 3.8 , p < 0.001 ) . among them , only mxp2 was rotated mesially ( 4.2 , p < 0.01 ) . when the amount of change was compared between the ca and oa groups , the oa group showed more lingual inclination of mxli ( 4.1 vs. 3.2 , p < 0.05 ) and less mesial - in rotation of mxm1 and mxm2 ( 3.3 vs. 0.7 , 3.0 vs. 0.5 , both p < 0.05 ) than ca group
