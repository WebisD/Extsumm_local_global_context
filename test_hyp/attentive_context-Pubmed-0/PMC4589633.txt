we used the bewo choriocarcinoma cell line in the experiments , which is a well - characterized trophoblast model exhibiting dynamic dna methylation as well as ability to syncytialise and increase crh expression when stimulated with camp   .
clonal bisulfite sequencing revealed the cpg site - specific and allele independent partial methylation of the crh proximal promoter and classified it as an intermediately methylated region of the genome .
we have utilized the dynamic changes of dna methylation in the bewo cell line to explore the relationship between this epigenetic chromatin modification and crh gene expression in a trophoblastic cell type .
furthermore , our results are consistent with the possibility that dna methylation controls crh expression indirectly , but any intervening factor that may regulate crh expression by a dna methylation - dependent mechanism remains to be determined .
the data suggest that promoter methylation determines the contribution of the cre , its various associated transcription factors , and a trophoblast specific alternative camp - response element to crh gene regulation .
methylation of the cre may thus function to influence the relative contribution of the two camp - response elements , their associated transcription factors , and the coupled signaling pathways to the overall activity of the crh gene under basal and camp - stimulated conditions .
