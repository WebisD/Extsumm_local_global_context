in the neu group also , the difference in mean dose between baseline and week 24 was small ( 0.24  0.09 and 0.28  0.09 , respectively ) , suggesting that perhaps the physicians were overly cautious in applying dose titration .
idet therapy was noted to be well - tolerated with minimal change in weight and a low risk of hypoglycemia in patients switched from nph insulin and iglar .
this sub - analysis of the a1chieve study aimed to determine the clinical safety and effectiveness of insulin detemir in indian patients switched from previous nph insulin or iglar therapy .
glycemic control was sub - optimal at baseline in patients previously treated with iglar and nph insulin . in the gla group , patients had a mean baseline hba1c of 9.9  1.8% , diabetes duration of 9.0  5.7 years and had been taking insulin for an average of 2.6  2.0 years . in the neu group ,
a total of 102 patients switched therapy from pre - study iglar to idet ( gla group ) , while 39 patients switched from pre - study nph insulin to idet ( neu group ) .
outcomes for lipid profile , body weight and sbp by pre - study basal insulin regimen in the gla group , the mean body weight was 72.1  11.7 kg at baseline and 72.3  11.3 kg at week 24 [ table 5 ] . over the same period in the neu group ,
