the purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the burden on healthcare workers by measuring rom , muscle activity , and hr during transfer of a simulated patient using either the rwc or a cwc .
our study showed that transferring a simulated patient from bed to the rwc decreased the rom on shoulder flexion , back muscle activity , and hr in the subjects compared to using a cwc .
shoulder flexion rom , activity of the back muscles , and hr were decreased in the subjects when transferred from bed to the rwc .
the peak rom of both shoulder flexion and left ankle abduction during assistive transfer to the rwc were significantly lower than with the cwc . left shoulder abduction , right shoulder rotation , and left knee flexion were significantly higher with the rwc than with the cwc . 

it is possible that the rwc will decrease workplace injuries and lower back pain in healthcare workers . using an assisted device to transfer patients without manual lifting has obvious benefits in healthcare and rehabilitation settings .
the % mvc of the right biceps , the left upper back muscles , the left lower back muscles , and the right vastus medialis muscle were significantly lower with the rwc than with the cwc .
