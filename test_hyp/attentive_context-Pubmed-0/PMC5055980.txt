although antibiotic resistance in aquaculture in the malaysian borneo is still in its infancy , the need for continuous monitoring of the antibiotic resistance patterns should not be overlooked and the community should be educated on the awareness of antibiotic resistance and its implication on human health and environment .
the mar indexing has revealed that 63.1% of the isolates came from low antibiotic usage area .
there is limited data on the antibiotic resistance of bacteria in fish and other cultured organisms sampled directly from fish farms as well as the aquaculture environment .
the resistance patterns were highly variable ; 20.2% ( n = 94 ) isolates have no resistance towards any antibiotics tested , 16% ( n = 94 ) isolates were resistant to only one antibiotic , and 63.8% ( n = 94 ) isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics .
the bacterial isolates showing the top five highest percentages of resistant were towards streptomycin ( 85% , n = 20 ) , followed by ampicillin ( 56.8% , n = 74 ) , penicillin ( 47.1% , n = 51 ) , erythromycin ( 43.1% , n = 51 ) , and cephalotin ( 42.3% , n = 71 ) . the bacterial isolates showing the top five highest percentages of susceptible were towards gentamicin ( 1.1% , n = 90 ) , followed by tobramycin ( 2.2% , n = 90 ) , chloramphenicol ( 4.0% , n = 75 ) , norfloxacin ( 5% , n = 80 ) , and amikacin ( 5.6% , n = 90 ) . the other bacterial isolates and their percentage of resistant are shown in table 1 . in this study , the antibiotic resistant patterns for all isolates were also determined to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance .
