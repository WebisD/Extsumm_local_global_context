instead , we selectively review a set of specific topics in neuroscience and cognitive science together supporting the notion that , within a particular interpretation , certain aspects of the mind - brain relationship can be framed as a rigorously defined and in principle soluble mathematical problem . in order to build this argument
we refer the reader to a sample collection of over 200 articles on consciousness and neuroscience available online .
the goal of this spotlight paper is emphatically not to provide an extensive review or even a balanced perspective of the enormous body of work on the brain - mind relationship in cognitive philosophy . to appreciate the breadth and depth of this topic ,
finally , we overview a sample of more specific available frameworks in neuroscience and cognitive science that appear particularly promising among the known existing candidates to help crack the mystery of the link between mental and neural activities .
next , we explicate what in our view would count as  solving  the mind - brain problem
the development of modern neuroscience led to the ( still ongoing ) accumulation of massive evidence that irreversibly linked the mind to the brain .
. then we elaborate on relevant general topics in the investigation of the brain and of the mind that will likely play a central role in a satisfactory explanation of the mind - brain relationship .
