frequent fractures due to trauma can aid in diagnosing this condition . in our case , the patient was negligent about the condition and reported to us with a fractured jaw .
oral manifestations include obtuse gonial angle , grooved palate , anterior cross - bite , malpositioned teeth associated with increased incidence of dental caries and periodontitis , hypoplastic maxilla , receded chin , delayed eruption of permanent teeth , delayed exfoliation of deciduous teeth and hypoplasia of root - obliterated pulp spaces .
now - a - days , symptomatic treatment is provided for patients with pycnodysostosis , with the main intention of prevention of fractures .
a 47-year - old man reported to the department with a complaint of deformed lower jaw for the past 10 years .
pycnodysostosis was first reported in 1923 by montanari , and he called it as atypical achondroplasia .
as pycnodysostosis is associated with inappropriate bone remodeling , it can pose a challenge for a dental health care professional to provide treatment as there can be serious complications , such as osteomyelitis arising as a result of dental infections .
our patient showed evidence of sequestrum in relation to the tooth 46 as a result of osteomyelitis .
