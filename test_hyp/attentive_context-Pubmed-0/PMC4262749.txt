based on national formulary of india , our data suggest that magnitude of off - label prescribing in pediatric inpatients is considerable higher than reported in some of the countries .
dose discrepancy and use in restricted age limits were identified as main contributor to off - label prescribing .
the prospective observational study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital in ahmedabad ( india ) for the period of six months .
there is need for strict drug regulation for pediatric population to ensure safety and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy .
using the data of the pediatric ward of a tertiary care hospital , we found that 70% of medicines were prescribed in off - label manner .
medicines which had no pediatric information were predominantly in antihypertensive drug class . on multivariate regression analysis as shown in table 5 , we found that pediatric patients in age of 0 to 2 years ( or 1.68 , 95% ci , 1.262.24 , ) were more likely to receive off - label medicines than any other age group .
