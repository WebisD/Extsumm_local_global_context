in addition , ra is more readily available than retinaldehyde in india and therefore , we did the following retrospective assessment to study the efficacy of topical raga combination in the treatment of acne scars .
a retrospective assessment was done at cutis academy of cutaneous sciences , bengaluru to study the efficacy of topical ra 0.025% and ga 12% ( raga ) combination in treating acne scars and pih ( postacne ) .
this study shows that the raga combination can be considered as a topical treatment for early acne scars including pih , thereby minimizing the need of procedural treatment for acne scars
. however , more studies are required to optimize the ideal concentration of each ingredient , viability of combined formulations in a single tube , frequency of application , and duration of treatment .
of the 35 patients , three showed no improvement in scar grades at the end of 12 weeks , while 16 patients demonstrated a mild improvement in their scars that is , the acne scar grades reduced to up to 5 points [ figure 1a and b ] .
though the efficacy of retinaldehyde and ga ( ralga ) combination has been well explored in treating acne scars , the efficacy of ra and ga ( raga ) combination has not been recorded .
