nevertheless , as antifungal activity of the present compound has not been reported so far and the efficacy is significantly high at low concentrations , there is enough possibility of using this compound in plant disease control under field conditions .
the maximum effect of the chemical was seen on the spores of h. penniseti as there was no germination at 1,500 ppm and also only 21% at 1,000 ppm as compared to control ( 87.33% ) .
similarly , among the four curvularia species , c. lunata was the most sensitive as the spore germination was significantly inhibited even at 250 ppm .
the fungi included in the present study belong to two different groups . but based on the activity of the chemical , it is at present difficult to conclude as to which group of fungi will be most susceptible to this chemical as the number of fungi from different groups is very low .
the effect of the chemical was tested at varying concentrations starting from 100 , 250 , 500 , 750 , 1,000 to 1,500 ppm .
significant inhibition of spore germination in a. brassicae was observed at 500 ppm and above and other two species of alternaria showed sensitivity at 750 ppm and above concentrations . while 250 ppm and above doses were significantly inhibitory for the germination of spores of heterosporium species , similar significant effect on erysiphe pisi and f. udum was seen at 1,000 and 1,500 ppm concentrations ( table .
