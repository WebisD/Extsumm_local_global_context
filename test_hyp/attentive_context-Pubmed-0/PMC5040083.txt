the results of elisa for 3 peptides , p2 , p10 , and p11 , are shown in fig .
gra6 localized in the dense granules and in the parasitophorous vacuole closely associated to the network .
the identification of specific epitopes targeted by the host antibody response is important both for understanding the natural response to infection and for the development of epitope - based vaccines and diagnostic methods .
the number of positive samples / tested for each peptide was as follows : p1:8/51 , p3:25/51 , p4:18/51 , p5:9/51 , p6:27/51 , p8:20/51 , and p10:31/51 . to determine the specificity of the anti - peptide antibody , elisa using an irrelevant peptide
4a ) . to compare the serological reactivity of the peptides with esa and recombinant gra6 , elisa using esa and recombinant gra6
furthermore , no significant differences were found between the mean absorbances of the 3 peptides , p2 , p7 , and p9 .
, we found that many regions of gra6 , particularly the regions represented by peptides p2 , p7 , and p9 , are involved in the pig antibody response , and strong reactivity with the t. gondii - infected pig sera was observed .
