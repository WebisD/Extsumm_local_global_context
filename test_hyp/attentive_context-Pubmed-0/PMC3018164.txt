indeed , while engineered sk variants tested in vivo showed strong and specific phosphorylation of new partners ( skerker et al , 2008 ) , we have found that , at least for the cases that we tested , the variants were unresponsive to changes in input stimulus ( supplementary figure s1 ) . taken together , the above observations suggest that to produce a signal - responsive system , it may be necessary to change both phosphotransfer and phosphatase specificity of a bifunctional sk . here , we use a directed evolution approach to explore interactions between the non - partner regulators cpxa and ompr . we show that by combining mutations in cpxa that individually increase ompr phosphorylation , phosphatase activity emerges and results in a circuit that is responsive to changes in cpxa stimulus .
this also simplifies the process of screening for new signaling pathways , which may be useful for synthetic applications involving the engineering of new microbial signaling circuits .
two - component systems , which are found in large numbers within bacteria , offer a rich setting for exploring the evolution of cell signaling ( wuichet et al , 2010 ) .
this complex behavior may emerge by simply combining mutations that increase cross - phosphorylation , which would be a relatively simple path in protein sequence space for the evolution of new signaling systems .
