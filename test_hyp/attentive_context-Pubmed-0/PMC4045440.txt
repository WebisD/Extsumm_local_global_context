the antioxidant -lipoic acid is more palatable than n - acetylcysteine and has shown benefit in preventing events associated with oxidative stress including diabetic neuropathy and glomerular injury . in humans , -lipoic acid has been used successfully to treat symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy , an effect believed to be induced by enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species . in a comparative study involving -lipoic acid and -tocopherol supplementation in human subjects , -lipoic acid administration was associated with comparable decreases in oxidative stress markers ( urinary fip , plasma protein carbonyls , and ldl oxidizability ) ; thus , it is plausible that administration of this agent may reduce oxidative stress induced by iv iron . the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a single oral dose of -lipoic acid given prior to administration of iv sodium ferric gluconate attenuates formation of oxidative stress markers and to determine if changes in iron indices correlate with changes in these markers .
the effect of chronic supplementation of -lipoic acid in patients with elevated free iron and inflammation warrants further study .
this study demonstrated that iv iron administration in hemodialysis patients was associated with a rise in oxidative stress markers ; however , pretreatment with the antioxidant -lipoic acid failed to prevent this increase in oxidative stress .
