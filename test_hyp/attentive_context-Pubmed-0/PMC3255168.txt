this suggests that genes , pathogens , and the immune system act together to cause alzheimer 's disease , and that a focus on pathogen detection and elimination should be a priority in the ageing at risk population .
hundreds of genes have been implicated in alzheimer 's disease , many of which can be grouped into discrete signalling networks and pathways relevant to the various subpathologies , risk factors , and biochemistry of alzheimer 's disease .
these gene subsets are thus related to multiple external factors that are each able to promote beta - amyloid deposition , suggesting that certain genes are related to the causes of alzheimer 's disease , ( agents able to provoke beta - amyloid deposition ) rather than ( and as well as ) to the underlying pathology of the disease itself .
many of the environmental risk factors associated with alzheimer 's disease , including infectious agents ( herpes simplex , chlamydia pneumonia , and borrelia burgdorferi ) as well as vitamin a deficiency , hypercholesterolaemia , hyperhomocysteinaemia or folate deficiency , oestrogen depletion , cerebral nerve growth factor ( ngf ) deprivation , diabetes , cerebral hypoperfusion ( leading to hypoxia and hypoglycaemia ) or are able to promote cerebral beta - amyloid deposition ( in the absence of any particular gene variant ) in animal models .
