thus , the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate effects of lwis and 
 mwis under unilateral weight - bearing conditions in healthy young adults .
in this study , we evaluated the immediate effects of lwis and mwis under unilateral weight 
 bearing conditions in healthy young adults .
however , the 
 change in kam and kla significantly decreased in the lwi condition compared with the mwi 
 condition .
therefore , to more accurately investigate the effects of a wedged - insole intervention , 
 unilateral weight bearing was analyzed as a movement task that assumed the mid - stance during 
 gait according to a previous study20 .
the changes in kam and kla under the lwi and mwi conditions between the subgroups are 
 presented in table 4table 4.the change in kam and kla under the lwi and mwi conditions between the

additionally , in the lwi condition , the change in kam 
 was positively correlated with the change in kla .
similar 
 to their findings , our results demonstrated that the change in kam mildly correlated with 
 the change in kla under the lwi condition . in brief , the reduction in kla with lwis may be 
 the central mechanism explaining the load - reducing effect , which also led to the reduction 
 in kam with lwis .
