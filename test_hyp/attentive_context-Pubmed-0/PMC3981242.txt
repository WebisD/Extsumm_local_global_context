we describe a case of a previously healthy caucasian female whose takayasu s arteritis presented as an association of aortic and main left coronary aneurysms with severe aortic insufficiency .
takayasu s arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis of unknown etiology that affects mainly the aorta and its branches . as a result of intimal fibroproliferation , segmental stenosis , occlusion , dilatation , and aneurysmal formation of the involved vessels
it is an uncommon disease , with an approximate incidence of 23 cases per year per million individuals and usually affects young female of asian ascendance during their second and third decades of life .
cineangiocoronariography confirmed the findings of the ct and also revealed a severe aortic insufficiency and a large main left coronary aneurysm ( figure 1 ) .
a 26-year - old caucasian female was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of fatigue , malaise , exertion dyspnea , ortophnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . there was a marked difference on the blood pressure measurement between the arms ( 140/90 mmhg on the right arm and 90/60 mmhg on the left ) .
the complexity of this case , allied to the absence of previously described medical interventions specific to this situation , certainly turns it into a therapeutic challenge .
