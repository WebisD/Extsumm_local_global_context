, we assessed the effects of eight weeks of three grams per day cinnamon supplementation ( cinnamomum zeylanicum ) on glycemic status , lipid profiles , blood pressure and body composition in type 2 diabetic patients .
in conclusion , our study shows that in type 2 diabetic patients , the intake of three grams per day cinnamon may lead to a moderate effect on glycemic status indicators , but does not improve blood pressure , blood lipid profile or body composition parameters .
while the fbg , hba1c and triglyceride levels in the cinnamon group was significantly reduced after the intervention compared with baseline ( p=0.005 , p=0.008 , p=0.038 respectively ) , no such effect were observed in the placebo group .
body weight and bmi in both groups were significantly reduced after the intervention compared with baseline ( p=0.017 , p=0.010 respectively ) .
our findings indicate that consuming three gram per day of cinnamon for eight weeks leads to significant reduction in some biochemical and anthropometric variables compared with baseline ( i.e. , fbg decreased by 9.2% , hba1c decreased by 6.12% , triglyceride decreased by 15.38% , body weight decreased by 1.19% , bmi decreased by 1.54% and fat body mass decreased by 1.36% ) . but these reductions were not significant compare to placebo group .
