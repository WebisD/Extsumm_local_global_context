we observed that the frequency of high index value of igm anti - hbc was 5.0% in obi and 2.5% in hbv carrier , suggesting a recent hbv infection .
cellular and humoral immune response pressure against hbv envelope proteins are the principal mechanisms originating obi . in this context , the aim of this study was to develop algorithms / methods to confirm anti - hbc test results .
the proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to nonspecific ( pha ) and specific stimuli ( hbv core antigen ; hcv ns5 antigen ) was analyzed in hbv carriers , obi , healthy donors , and two groups based on a threshold of co / s  0.1 and co / s  0.1 .
in addition , the magnitude of t - cell responses to hbcag in hbv spontaneous resolvers was clearly higher when compared to hbv carriers , healthy donors , anti - hbc false - positive results , and obi ( p > 0.001 ) .
however , the index value of igm anti - hbc may increase to levels usually detectable in acute infection in 1020% of chronic hepatitis b patients with acute exacerbation or hepatitis flare that often leads to a misdiagnosis of acute hepatitis b . in our study
