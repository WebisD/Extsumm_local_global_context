variation in the organization of root tissues , development of apoplastic barriers and the distribution pattern of zn and cd and other elements in s.  caprea isolates originating from polluted and unpolluted sites support the hypothesis that these features are results of environmental adaptation . understanding the molecular basis of these adaptive traits
edx analyses show that cd and zn interfere differently with the element uptake systems in s.  caprea , and that for some elements this effect is isolate - specific .
might help to increase the tolerance and heavy metal accumulation capacities of s.  caprea for phytoremediation technologies .
( 2005 ) found that the total area of the root , the diameter of the vascular bundles , the number of xylem strands and the area they occupied in stele were higher in coffee plants grown without zn in the medium than in plants exposed to zn . a similar decrease of tissue areas after zn application
the aim of this work was to get a better understanding of the involvement of root tissues in the uptake , translocation and accumulation of cd and zn in a woody species promising for phytoextraction , s.  caprea .
to better understand uptake and accumulation of elements into shoots , knowledge of root anatomy and physiology is essential .
