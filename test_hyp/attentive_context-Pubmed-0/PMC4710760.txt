therefore , in this study , we address the question of whether , and if so how , acute nicotine administration into te2 can modulate the memory of cues that are predictive of threat events .
thus , the relationship between nicotine use and stress - related disorders requires further evaluation .
2014 ) . in the present study , we focused on the effects of nicotine in the retrieval phase of memory processes , which could be similar to the mental recall / avoidance of trauma - associated stimuli observed in ptsd - suffering individuals . in this framework , our data suggest that individuals with ptsd tend to use nicotine ( by smoking cigarettes ) as a self - medication to relieve fear and anxiety induced by sensory cues or intrusive memories . on the other hand , our data also showed that threat memories are unaffected by nicotine after its use , i.e. ptsd - like symptoms remain intact after nicotine use .
it is worth mentioning that in our study nicotine was administered locally in the cortex and acutely in drugs - nave animals .
in this study , we have shown that acute nicotine administration into the te2 auditory cortex before the retrieval of remote fearful memories decreases fear - evoked responses .
