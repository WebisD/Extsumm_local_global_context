we report a very rare case of trigeminal ganglioneuroma in the prepontine and cerebellopontine angle cistern , in a 44-year - old female and describe the magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging characteristics , including diffusion - weighted imaging ( dwi ) findings .
trigeminal ganglioneuroma is a very rare tumor ; however , this tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumors with low adc values in the prepontine and cerebellopontine angle cistern .
a 44-year - old female was admitted to our hospital because of a 2-year history of facial pain and numbness in the left side .
intracranial involvement of ganglioneuromas is extremely rare ( 1 , 2 ) , and there has been only one report of ganglioneuroma arising from the trigeminal nerve .
trigeminal ganglioneuroma is a very rare tumor ; however , this tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumors with low adc values in the prepontine and cerebellopontine angle cistern .
ganglioneuromas are rare benign tumors of neural crest origin ; they arise from peripheral sympathetic ganglia or the adrenal glands .
the preoperative diagnosis for this poorly enhancing mass with a dwi high signal intensity lesion in the prepontine and cerebellopontine angle cistern was an epidermoid cyst .
