although work provide a range of benefits such as increased income , social contact , and sense of purpose , it can also have negative effects on mental health , particularly in the form of stress .
the reviews used standardised differences including mean differences and mean effect sizes , and standardised differences and means . using a consistent set of outcomes to measure anxiety and depression in future primary studies
