thus bacterial infection plays an important role in the progression of acute otitis media to ome , which in turn causes hearing loss , social malformation and high medical costs .
as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis of the pcr products , a. otitidis was the bacterium most frequently isolated ; there were 18 positive samples amongst a total of 55 ( 25.7% ) , and bacterial dnas related to a. otitidis were detected in 33% and 67% of unilaterally and bilateral affected patients , respectively .
amongst 12 patients with bilateral ome caused by a. otitidis , unilateral infection was caused by h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae in one and two cases , respectively .
, we accepted that a. otitidis , s. pneumoniae , h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis are major bacterial pathogens in otitis media with effusion , where a. otitidis was the most often isolated bacterium in iranian children with middle ear effusion .
the quality of the effusion was analyzed visually and was mucous in 32 ( 71.2% ) children and serous in 13 ( 28.8% ) patients .
about 20 out of 45 patients ( 45% ) with unilateral involvement and 25 out of 45 patients ( 55% ) with bilateral involvement had samples positive for bacterial dna . during surgery ,
