, we performed a systematic literature review and evaluation of the evidence associating circulating levels of mmps with subclinical atherosclerosis outcomes in ckd patients .
in summary , the published evidence reviewed here demonstrates that circulating mmps levels could potentially be of use as biomarkers of subclinical atherosclerosis in adult ckd populations .
studies characterized by larger and well defined ckd populations and involving several mmps and a consistent and homogenized assessment of different measures of subclinical atherosclerosis such as imt and plaque burden are urgently needed .
inclusion criteria were ckd cohort or case - control studies involving ckd patients , reporting as one of the outcomes of interest , the relationship of circulating measurement of mmps or their tissue inhibitors ( timps ) , and markers of atherosclerosis ( i.e. , imt , plaque number , or similar atherosclerotic outcomes ) .
although this state of chronic inflammation in ckd renders mmps attractive candidates for studies in this population and despite the mounting evidence of their role in cvd , the association between mmps and subclinical atherosclerosis in ckd patients has not been systematically studied . to this effect
notably , in these studies , circulating levels of mmp-2 were associated with previous history of cvd in a non - hd ckd population   and in a peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) population , providing further supporting evidence for mmp-2 association with cvd in ckd ( supplementary table  1 ) . for consistency , we also excluded studies that had measured mmp expression in vessel tissue instead of circulating concentrations .
