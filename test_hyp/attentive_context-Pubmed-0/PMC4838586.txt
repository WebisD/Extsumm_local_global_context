group a included all the korean g. lucidum strains , as well as the g. lucidum strains from bangladesh and japan , and chinese g. sichuanense and g. lingzhi .
the comparison of the its rdna sequences and the estimation of the basidiospores size presented in this study confirm previous findings and contribute additional evidence that suggests the naming korean cultivated yeongji strains of ' g. lucidum ' should be renamed as g. lingzhi .
the findings of the current study are consistent with those of park et al .   who reported that g. lucidum strains from europe and north america could be clustered into one group together with g. tsugae based on both analyses of the its rdna gene and partial -tubulin gene sequences .
group e includes three strains of g. resinaceum from the czech republic and uk ( two strains ) , and was supported by very high bootstrap values of 99% .
likewise , hong and jung   reported that the g. lucidum from korea and japan were monophyletic , and were distinguished from the g. lucidum from europe and north america based on sequence analysis of mitochondrial small - subunit ribosomal dna .
interestingly , korean g. lucidum strains could be clustered into a group together with g. sichuanense and g. lingzhi strains from china .
