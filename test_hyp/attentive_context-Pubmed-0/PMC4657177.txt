but at a time when scientists are increasingly challenged to focus on translational aspects of their research , it is perhaps worth reflecting on what we know about the cellular interactome and the extent to which our current understanding can lead to rational strategies with predictable outcomes for controlling biological systems .
another major impact area for cell biology is in our understanding of pathogens , which act by directly influencing or hijacking cellular processes in host cells ; understanding how leads both to therapeutic insights as well as to a better understanding of cellular processes .
the promise of cell biology for its impacts on downstream translational applications thus remains extremely high .
the impacts of such understanding are potentially vast , allowing us to create new medical therapeutics and diagnostics as well as to harness cells as factories in the biotechnology industry for medicines , pesticides , biofuels , and new foods and materials .
these networks are the basis of systems medicine , through which scientists are taking a network view of disease to enable drug repurposing and drug discovery .
this number is much higher if one considers the many possible combinations of interactions any protein may make at different times , or if one includes interactions between proteins and other macromolecules ( e.g. , dna and rna ) . a major challenge in cell biology is thus to elucidate dynamic interactomes of consequence and to understand how these interactomes lead to cellular phenotypes .
