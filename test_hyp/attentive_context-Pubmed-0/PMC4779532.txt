the patients and rabbit blood have shown significantly increased plasma concentration of tgf-1 is markedly correlated to the development of the iua , and iua is promoted to the increased tissue expression of tgf-1 and smad3 and decreased smad7 .
therefore , treatments targeting the modification of tgf-1 , smad3 , and smad7 signaling via suppressing smad3 with sis3 may provide a new therapeutic strategy for iua .
our findings indicate that alterations in the expression of tgf-1 and smad3 components occur during the development of iua in both patient and experimental rabbit model .
we found the tissue mrna and protein expression of smad3 levels are significantly increased in patients and experimental rabbit model compared to those in controls ( p < 0.05 ) .
we divided three experimental approaches : in the first approach we demonstrated patient plasma for tgf-1 and fibrous tissue for mrna and protein that has expressed the regulatory smad3 and inhibitory smad7 in addition to tgf-1 , respectively . in the second approach ,
elisa analysis was used to determine the expressions of plasma tgf-1 , rt - qpcr were used to determine smad3 and smad7 mrna , and western analysis was used to determine total smad3 , p - smad3 , smad7 , and tgf-1 protein expression in both patient and rabbit model . in the present study , we demonstrated that the plasma concentration and protein expression of tgf-1 levels significantly increase in iua patients and experimental rabbit model compared to those in controls , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .
