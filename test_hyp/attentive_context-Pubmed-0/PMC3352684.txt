there was a significant influence of the investment refractory materials on the color parameters a * , b * , and l * on the ceramics tested , resulting in chromatic alterations unacceptable for some of the ceramic groups tested .
because color is considered a sensation obtained through proprioceptive mechanisms , and thus considered subjective , standardized colorimetric techniques were developed with the objective of transforming colors in numeric values.8 for this aim , the cie l*a*b system of colors was created,19 eliminating inconsistencies inherent in color perception and specification among observers.8 this type of evaluation becomes important as the investment / ceramic relationship constitutes the base of the process of manufacturing ceramic restorations and is directly related to the final aesthetic quality of this type of restoration.7,15 the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of investment type on the color of various conventional powder - slurry feldspathic ceramics .
vision esthetic ceramic was the only ceramic to present statistically significant differences ( p=.0001 ) in all color parameters ( a * , b * , and l * ) among the control and investments tested .. the exception for vision esthetic ceramic was for the investments fortune and vitadurvest for b * and duravest for a * , with no statistical difference ( p>.05 ) .
