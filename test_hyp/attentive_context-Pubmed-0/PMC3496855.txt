, we focus exclusively on the growing body of evidence that annexin a2 and its partner protein p11 contribute to human health and disease .
, we summarize evidence from both animal models and human studies on the in vivo functions of the annexin a2/s100a10 system .
annexin a2 ( a2 ) belongs to the annexin family of ca - regulated phospholipid binding proteins , which are expressed in plants , animals , and protists throughout the phylogenetic tree .
these data suggest that annexin a2 may represent a significant modifier gene that shapes the clinical expression and natural history of sickle cell disease .
a2 is a 36-kilodalton protein produced by endothelial cells , monocytes , macrophages , trophoblast cells , and some tumor cells and exists both free in the cytoplasm and in association with intracellular and plasma membrane surfaces   .
this mechanism appears to require cleavage of a2 by plasmin as well as activation of toll - like receptor 4 . in this paper
expression levels of annexin a2 have been examined in a variety of human malignancies . in some , such as renal cell   , gastric , prostate , pancreatic , breast   carcinoma , and osteogenic sarcoma , increased expression levels appear to correlate with higher histologic grade and/or development of distant metastases . in human glioblastoma ,
