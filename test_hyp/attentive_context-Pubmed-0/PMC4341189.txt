this strength obviously has a detrimental effect on the bone next to the implant and could lead to disintegration.2,3 rotation of an implant after eight weeks of healing , based on contractual implant success benchmark , could be a sign of failure and in this situation implant removal would be planned even in the absence of the other established indicators of non - osteointegration.4,5,6,7,8 in other words loose implants are considered as failure and are prescribed to be removed.1 but several studies have shown that loose implant can result from the absence of bone - implant contacts,1 and is not considered as the failed implant.1,9,10,11 there is a difference between rotational mobility and buccolingual mobility.2 according to observations from clinicians , despite the possibility of non integration implicated by the rotation,4 it seems acceptable if the implant is allowed to heal for an additional period of time , integration of an implant can be re - established.1,12 considering the resistance to 20 ncm reverse torque is a parameter for osseointegration and a measure of functional stability,13 so clinicians have to decide how long they should wait for re - integration of the implant or when they should remove it from the mouth.2 however , there are very limited data supporting their decision at present.2 there is no basic and fulfilling study in this field therefore more research due to the increasing use of implant in the world and also the interest in early and immediate loading of implants is needed.2,4 this investigation is designed to find the answer to two questions : first , the best time and the success of counter torquing or transposition of inserted implants , second : whether it is possible , for any given reason , to transport implants in the bone once they are integrated .
