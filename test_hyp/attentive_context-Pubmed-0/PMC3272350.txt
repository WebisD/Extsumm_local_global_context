the current state of knowledge of the aetiology and differential diagnoses of tw will be discussed , followed by an analysis of patient wishes and expectations when seeking sensible solutions for their tw problems .
will ensure that as much good as possible is achieved for the patient ( beneficence ) whilst avoiding harm ( nonmaleficience ) and upholding the patients ' rights to have the reasonable treatment undertaken that most closely matches their wishes and expectations ( autonomy ) .
tooth wear ( tw ) , also known as tooth surface loss ( tsl ) , is an insidious and cumulative multifactorial process involving destruction of enamel and dentine which can threaten tooth survival and the oral health related quality of life of affected individuals   . despite the overall trends towards improved oral health and reduced dental caries incidence over the last decades
traditional concepts must now be reassessed in order to achieve a radical paradigm shift in the philosophies behind tw management .
the relative risks and benefits of the possible management options will then be weighed up with reference to current available evidence .
greater understanding of the pathophysiology of tw has driven advances in dental materials and techniques for the benefit of affected patients .
