hence , the main goal of the study was to examine the role of difficulties in emotion regulation and mindfulness in psychological and somatic symptoms of patients with fgid .
overall , the findings of the study indicate that the constructs of emotion regulation difficulties ( emotional dysregulation ) and mindfulness are related to both psychological and somatic symptoms in fgid , but some factors of dysregulation have more influential role in relation to increased symptoms as well as decreased mindfulness .
so , should this concept be valid , self - reported lack of awareness in ders alone may not be related to awareness of the present moment in mindfulness , because mindfulness includes awareness of emotional experiences with an attitude of acceptance and nonjudging ( 21 ) .
although more research is needed to uphold conclusions , the study can be a thoroughfare for future research in more examination of influential factors in poor emotion regulatory ability and their roles in developing psychological and somatic symptoms in physical disorders .
afterwards , to examine whether the factors of difficulties in emotion regulation ( ders ) and mindfulness ( maas ) predict independent variances in the severity of both aspects of symptoms , we performed stepwise multiple regression analyses . in the first step of regression , ders ( total and its factors ) were entered as the sole predictors of symptoms , and in the next step , mindfulness was entered .
