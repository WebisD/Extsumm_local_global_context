acute gastroenteritis ( age ) , characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting , still represents a major cause of morbidity even in industrialized countries , being mortality confined in mostly resource - constrained nations .
the rv vaccine coverage ( estimated less than 10% ) did not reach yet significant levels to affect the overall epidemiology of the disease , the figures reported here can be considered as a pre - vaccination picture . a progressive reduction of all hospitalizations for acute diarrhea in children , in the study period , which is more evident for age of unspecified etiology and of bacterial and parasitic origin was observed .
vitale et  al , using the markov model and considering a cohort of 555,791 births in 2011 in italy , in the absence of vaccination , estimated an average of 14,000 hospitalizations per year by using the rvge hospital rates collected within the reveal study ; in our study , an average of 9,918 hospitalizations per year for rv in any diagnosis was found out . whereas an underestimation of hospitalizations through the hdd by around 4050% was reported ,
our findings support the need of including both pd and sd , which also includes nosocomial infection forms and the incidence of which was estimated in italy by 5.3% in children under 30 months , in rv hospitalizations analysis .
