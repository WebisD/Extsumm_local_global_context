thereby , reconstruction of the last common ancestor ( lca ) to all mollusks , the so - called hypothetical ancestral mollusk , has been hampered by difficulties in recovering fossils of unambiguous molluscan stem species and by the lack of a general agreement concerning the relationships of the various molluscan class - level taxa to each other . as a consequence ,
the transient expression of typical polyplacophoran - like muscles in the wirenia larva , however , strongly suggests that at least neomeniomorph aplacophorans stem from an ancestor with polyplacophoran - like features that most likely also included seven shell plates .
the recent description of a cylindrical ( i.e. , worm - shaped ) sclerite- and shell - bearing paleozoic mollusk   and the results of integrative molecular - paleontological studies   have been considered as evidence for the presence of seven or eight shell plates in the lca of crown - group aculiferans . if correct , this implies that the body plan of recent aplacophorans is the result of secondary simplification and thus a derived condition   . despite additional descriptions of fossils that exhibit a mixture of polyplacophoran- and aplacophoran - like features  
this , together with the cylindrical shape of the aplacophorans and the polyplacophoran larva as well as the fossil kulindroplax , argues for a worm - like body shape of the lca of aculifera , rendering the dorsoventrally flattened appearance of recent polyplacophorans a derived condition .
