the goal of this work was , based on a comprehensive review of the rich literature on the theme and adapting thereof , to develop , establish , and validate classical and real - time rt - pcr protocols for ( intravitam ) diagnosis of rabies and molecular - epidemiological characterisation of viral strains with the main emphasis on the growing number of known species / genotypes .
in this work we could show and validate the suitability of an adapted and further developed real - time rt - pcr protocol for the rapid , efficient , and highly sensitive intravitam diagnosis of a wide spectrum of lyssavirus species followed by rapid molecular - epidemiological characterisation of viral isolates respective to origin of the virus and source of exposure , using heminested rt - pcr .
this new tool is also particularly promising for active surveillance of european bat lyssaviruses using oral swabs in live - captured bats .
this assay uses genotype ( gt ) specific probes and fluorophore signals for direct differentiation of gt1 , gt5 , and gt6 in a single - tube reaction .
clinical specimens like brain suspensions ( 1x human , 12x mouse ) , skin biopsies from the nape of the neck ( 3x human , 1x mouse ) , saliva ( 4x human ) , and cerebrospinal fluids ( 6x human ) were used for the establishment of the assays . both hnrt - pcr and real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) were shown to work properly on all these samples without significant inhibition using gapdh as internal control for conventional rt - pcr and sendai virus for real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) , which was mixed to the samples before rna isolation .
