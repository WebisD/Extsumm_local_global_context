given that differences in the biology of lung cancer and other diseases exist between men and women   , investigations to identify genomic biomarkers for clinical assignment of therapies on an individual patient basis are crucial . in this paper , the ratio of between - group to within - group sums of squares ( bw ratio , ) gene selection algorithm is used to obtain a feasible set of influential genes via variable importance ranking procedure   in the training phases of 20 trials of 10-fold cv within leave - one - out cross - validation ( loocv ) procedure as illustrated below .
the procedure is shown to have good  sensitivity  and  specificity  in the sense that the sex - specific genes obtained can improve prediction accuracy in classification of individual patient 's prognosis .
the proposed procedure to discover predictive and prognostic sex - specific genomic biomarkers for individualized treatment of diseases can play a critical role in developing safer and more effective therapies that replace one - size - fits - all drugs with treatments that focus on specific patient needs .
development of a biomarker classifier involves two distinct components : ( 1 ) a procedure for building a classifier and ( 2 ) validation / evaluation procedure for estimating the error rate of biomarker .
