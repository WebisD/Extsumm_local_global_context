saline - enhanced rfa might be a promising technique for the management of inoperable lung malignancies and has the potential for use as a minimally invasive approach . to determine whether the technique can be feasibly and safely used to produce a sufficiently large volume of necrosis to be of value in the treatment of small peripheral lung tumors in patients for whom surgery or palliative radiotherapy is unsuitable , further study using a larger animal model is warranted
in addition , since the 17-gauge electrode used in this study is too large for rabbits , with their relatively smaller lungs , the complication rates of rfa might be overestimated . in conclusion , ct - guided percutaneous transthoracic rfa with simultaneous hypertonic saline infusion is feasible , and more effectively produces coagulation necrosis than rfa without saline infusion .
the mean maximum diameters of acute lesions induced by a 1-cm active tip , as measured in gross specimens , were 12.5  1.6 and 8.5  1.4 mm , respectively ; this difference between the two groups was statistically significant ( p < .05 ) ( table 1 ) . in the srfa group ,
1 ) , while contrast - enhanced ct showed no enhancement in the region of altered pulmonary attenuation .
