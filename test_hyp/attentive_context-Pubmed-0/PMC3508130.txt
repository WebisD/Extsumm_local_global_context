1structure of chitosan structure of chitosan in the present study , an attempt has been made to assess the salubrious effect of dietary chitosan intake on myocardial lipid peroxidation and glutathione - dependent antioxidant status in young and aged rats by virtue of its antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties .
each group was further subdivided into three groups ( six rats each ) : one control group ( group ia and group iia ) and two experimental groups based on the duration of supplementation of chitosan at 2  % level along with feed 30  days ( group ib and group iib ) and 60  days ( group ic and group iic ) . at the end of the experimental period ,
significant ( p  <  0.05 ) variation was observed in the body weight ( grams ) of young ( initial , 129    9.05 ; final , 249    18.3 ) and aged ( initial , 382    27.2 ; final , 336    23.1 ) chitosan - supplemented groups of rats .
level of total cholesterol was significantly ( p  <  0.05 ) higher in plasma and heart tissue of group iia aged rats as compared to group ia young control rats , indicating the development of mild age - associated hypercholesterolemic condition ( tables  2 and 3 ) .
