finally , if the incidence of frailty in the study population is compared to the number of years of anti - retroviral therapy taken by the patients , the longer patients took anti - retroviral therapy , the less the incidence of frailty ( p < 0.05 ) .
the characteristics of the frail and non - frail patients were not significantly different except for a higher rate of hepatitis c and neuropathy in the frail group ( p < 0.05 ) .
clinical measurement of frailty in hiv-1 infected patients is important as frailty may be reversible in its early stages ( e.g. interventions to reverse deconditioning , protein - energy malnutrition , depression , vitamin d deficiency and other frailty related conditions ) before depleted reserves reach a critical threshold leading to irreversible vulnerability and functional decline .
the clinical importance of frailty is that the syndrome is considered a high - risk state , predictive of adverse health outcomes such as decreased function and mobility , hospitalization and death.numerous studies in the last 10 years have tried to assess frailty in different populations .
the first study compared frailty in hiv-1 infected men in the pre - treatment era to a control group of hiv uninfected men .
