we report two patients presenting with swelling and pain in the maxillary region who were clinico - radiologically suspected of malignancy ; however , fnac in both the cases revealed fungal sinusitis ( fs ) .
this report emphasizes on the early diagnosis of ifs , which can be managed conservatively preventing the morbidity and mortality in these patients .
invasive fungal sinusitis ( ifs ) responds to conservative medical management and debridement ; hence , an early diagnosis by fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) is mandatory to prevent undue surgery .
cytology , being an easily available , minimally invasive and inexpensive procedure , can be used as initial diagnostic modality in cases of ifs .
clinico - radiological findings can be misleading as the lesions are locally destructive and mimic a neoplasm .
fungal sinusitis constitutes 69% of all the rhinosinusitis.  clinically , it presents as either an acute fulminant sinusitis or chronic invasive sinusitis .
worldwide , aspergillus fumigatus is the most common species , followed by aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus , whereas a. flavus is the most common species in india .
, aspergillus leads to highly destructive lesions ; however , literature search shows invasive aspergillosis in non - neutropenic patients also .
