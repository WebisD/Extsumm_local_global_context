high - grade necs of the esophagus are rare tumors exhibiting an overall aggressive behavior , and their prognosis is dismal .
novel therapies like mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , tyrosine kinase and angiogenesis inhibitors have showing promising results in clinical trials . we herein report a case of esophageal large - cell necs and review the published literature on this rare disease .
the majority are locally advanced or metastatic at presentation and are rarely associated with secretory hormonal syndromes .
treatment regimens are extrapolated from more robust data published on pulmonary high - grade necs .
a genetic etiology of gep - nens has been well documented in around 5 - 10% of cases as part of hereditary syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 , von hippel - lindau syndrome , neurofibromatosis 1 or tuberous sclerosis syndrome .
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms ( gep - nens ) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms defined as malignant transformation of neuroendocrine cells in the diffuse neuroendocrine system that regulates secretion , absorption and motility of the gastrointestinal tract .
large - cell nec of the esophagus is exceedingly rare ; few cases have been reported in the literature .
