the objective of the present study was to compare the 3-level acdf to combinations of acdr and acdf with displacement controlled kinematics at instrumented and adjacent levels .
the artificial disc in 3-level constructs has biomechanical advantages compared to fusion in normalizing motion .
these biomechanical findings suggest that while hybrid conditions failed to restore normal motion within the construct , they significantly normalized motion in adjacent segments compared with the 3-level acdf condition .
for the 3dpd hybrid construct , implantation of upper - level ( c3-c4 ) acdr resulted in significant increase of rom only in right rotation ( p<0.05 ; maximal variation of + 36% ) , while implantation of lower - level ( c5-c6 ) acdr resulted in significant increase of rom in all 6 loading conditions except for flexion ( p<0.05 ; maximal variation of + 41% ) .
for 3pdp hybrid construct , implantation of middle - level ( c3-c4 ) acdr resulted in significant increase of rom in extension , left rotation , and right rotation compared to intact ( p<0.05 ; maximal variation of + 67% ) but produced motion increase in flexion , left bending , and right bending , without significant difference ( p>0.05 ) ( figure 6 , table 1 ) .
