subjects with 25(oh)d3 concentration below 50 nmol / l had the doubled risk of newly diagnosed diabetes compared with those having higher serum concentrations . therefore , our data suggest an inverse association between the serum concentration of 25(oh)d3 and the odds of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes , thereby suggesting a protective role of vitamin d against the development of the disease , as suggested previously ( 13 ) . in further support of this association , we observed an increasing concentration of hba1c with decreasing 25(oh)d3 concentration , and this association was independent of bmi , serum triacylglycerides , smoking status , and sex .
vitamin d deficiency showed a much weaker or for type 2 diabetes previously diagnosed , as could perhaps have been anticipated , given the vigorous clinical management of the disease and the longer time interval between disease development and the assessment of vitamin d status .
after further adjustment for bmi , serum triacylglycerides , serum hdl , pcb exposure , smoking , and month of blood sampling , the association between vitamin d deficiency and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes remained unchanged ( or 1.99   ; p = 0.022 ) , whereas the adjusted or for pre - existing diabetes in vitamin d deficiency was reduced considerably by similar adjustment ( or 1.48 ; p = 0.132 ) ( table 2 ) .
