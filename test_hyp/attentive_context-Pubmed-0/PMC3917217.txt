the use of laser treatment in periodontal therapy is an emerging therapeutic option , although little reliable evidence suggests that it can effectively treat peri - implantitis .
traditional protocols of non - surgical periodontal therapy , in conjunction with the use of an 810-nm diode laser , can be an effective alternative treatment modality for peri - implantitis
peri - implantitis is inflammation of the peri - implant supporting tissue , which can lead to progressive loss of supporting bone , if untreated .
the outcome of non - surgical periodontal treatment ( nspt ) of peri - implantitis is unpredictable .
supportive periodontal therapy is essential to enhance the long - term outcome of implant therapy .
a 45-year - old male presented with pain and swelling at a mandibular implant site ( nobel biocare , sw ) . clinical examination revealed a deep pocket [ 7-mm pocket depth ( pd ) ] and bleeding on probing [ figure 1 ] , with suppuration and gingival inflammatory edema at the implant site .
regardless of the method used , correctly performed supportive periodontal therapy is a key factor in successful implant therapy .
it is of paramount importance to treat periodontitis of the residual dentition prior to implant placement . a higher implant failure rate and elevated number of sites with peri - implant bone loss were documented in periodontally compromised patients who did not adhere to comprehensive supportive periodontal therapy . customized and correctly performed
