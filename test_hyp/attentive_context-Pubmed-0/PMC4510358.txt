we report a case of hepatic glycogenosis mimicking mauriac syndrome in a patient with poorly controlled type 1 dm who showed hepatomegaly , cushingoid face , mild growth retardation , and delayed menarche .
thus far , eight cases of type 1 dm accompanied by hepatic glycogenosis and three cases of mauriac syndrome have been reported in korea234 ) .
3 ) . through a liver biopsy , we found ballooning degeneration with nuclear vacuolization of hepatocytes ( fig .
hepatic glycogenosis in type 1 dm is a key mechanism of mauriac syndrome and is a rare diabetic complication first reported by mauriac in 19305 ) .
therefore , appropriate glycemic control is important to the treatment and prevention of hepatic glycogenosis in type 1 dm .
however , hepatic glycogenosis in type 1 dm is a reversible complication that is different from nash , which is often presented in obese type 2 dm patients .
hepatic glycogenosis in type 1 dm patients is a reversible complication by strict blood glucose level control , which is different from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) in obese type 2 dm .
mauriac syndrome is a rare complication of type 1 dm that is characterized by hepatomegaly due to hepatic glycogenosis , growth retardation , delayed development of puberty , and cushingoid features .
