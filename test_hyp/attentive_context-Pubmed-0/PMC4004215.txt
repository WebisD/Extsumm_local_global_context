this method enables the investigation of protecting 
 groups on the anomeric equilibrium and is compatible with acid and 
 base sensitive functionality .
a new method of equilibration of sialyl anomeric 
 c  o bonds 
 has been developed on the basis of the fischer  ingold persistent 
 radical effect .
the trans - fused oxazolidinone 
 moiety is found by this method to stabilize equatorial glycosides 
 over their axial counterparts , i.e. , to reduce the magnitude of the 
 anomeric effect .
this effect , which adds to a series of recent observations 
 on the influence of cyclic protecting groups on the anomeric effect , is a manifestation of the strongly electron - withdrawing nature of 
 the trans - fused oxazolidinone , ( and by extrapolation trans - fused cyclic carbonates ) , which is a direct consequence 
 of the highly dipolar nature of such heterocycles .
the strongly electron - withdrawing 
 nature of these groups manifest by the present study more than likely 
 also plays an important role in the high kinetic selectivity observed 
 in the trans - fused oxazolidinone ( and cyclic carbonate)-directed 
 -sialoside synthesis methods .
the unusually poor kinetic diastereoselectivity 
 of anomeric radicals in the sialic acid series is a function of the 
 -type planar nature of these radicals coupled with the existence 
 of competing 1,3-diaxial interactions in the diastereomeric transition 
 states for the formation of both anomers .
