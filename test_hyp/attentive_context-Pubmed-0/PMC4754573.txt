this article describes two different revascularization treatment protocols in necrotic immature teeth , which led to different clinical outcomes .
since many of these teeth achieve acceptable clinical outcomes i.e. being infection - free , asymptomatic and clinically functional , it seems logical to reframe our perspectives in this field and expand the scope of definition of success in endodontic regenerative treatment , and consider the aforementioned clinical outcomes as success .
there is considerable debate on the ideal outcome of regenerative endodontic treatment . with respect to the nature of regeneration
, it seems that there is a gap between the expected histological outcomes and what actually happens in the root canal system , at least in many instances .
pulp necrosis in the first case was due to a traumatic event . in the second case ,
they suggested re - defining the clinical success and proposed that the clinical success must be redefined as when calcification occurs in the absence of any signs and symptoms and the infection is completely resolved . despite the fact that formation of intracanal mineralized tissue and pulp canal obliteration are inconsistent with the concept of regeneration
a healthy 16 year - old male patient was referred to the department of endodontics at the school of dentistry of tehran university of medical sciences .
