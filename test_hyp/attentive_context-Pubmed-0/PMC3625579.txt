recently , enormous progress has been made in better understanding of pathogenesis of gastric malt lymphoma .
still , not enough clinical trials are performed due to rare expression and high effectiveness of first line treatment of gastric malt lymphoma .
this disorder is the best example of how infectious pathogens and genetic abnormalities lead to malignant transformation .
malt lymphoma arises from the extranodal sites reach in b - lymphocytes , which appears in response to chronic antigenic stimulation caused by infection ( helicobacter pylori ) or autoimmune process ( hashimoto disease ) .
what is more important is that early diagnosis of gastric malt lymphoma is extremely important . while the symptoms are unspecific or not , always during the endoscopic exam the complete histological biopsies must be taken to make diagnosis correctly . the less advanced the stage of the disease , the bigger the chances to achieve complete remission
gastric malt lymphoma pathogenesis is a complex process including many gene alternations that result in cancer appearance .
it is an indolent type , but clinical outcomes and response to treatment vary among patients .
the name of mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphoma was first established in 1983 by isaacson and du . from the beginning , it was adopted well and is still used in an unchanged form .
