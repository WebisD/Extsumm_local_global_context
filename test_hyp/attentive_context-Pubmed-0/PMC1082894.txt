it is clear that the effective use of cell - culture - produced 
 anthocyanins can now elucidate previously hidden roles of 
 anthocyanin pigments in human health and metabolism .
the 
 free - radical scavenging and antioxidant capacities of anthocyanin 
 pigments are the most highly publicized of the modus operandi 
 used by these pigments to intervene with human therapeutic 
 targets , but , in fact , research clearly suggests that other 
 mechanisms of action are also responsible for observed health 
 benefits   .
the roles of anthocyanin pigments as medicinal agents have been 
 well - accepted dogma in folk medicine throughout the world , and , in 
 fact , these pigments are linked to an amazingly broad - based range 
 of health benefits .
phytochemicals in this class 
 are frequently referred to as bioflavonoids due to their 
 multifaceted roles in human health maintenance , and anthocyanins in food are typically ingested as 
 components of complex mixtures of flavonoid components .
the nature of the sugar conjugate and the aglycone 
 are important determinants of anthocyanin absorption and 
 excretion in both humans and rats .
anthocyanins have been credited with capacity to modulate 
 cognitive and motor function , to enhance memory , and to have a 
 role in preventing age - related declines in neural function .
