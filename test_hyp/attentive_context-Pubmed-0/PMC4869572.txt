itgcn is more common in higher tumor stages and is accompanied with elevated serum -fp levels before the surgery . since the prevalence of itgcn is higher in the regions with high incidence of testis cancer and in high stages of germ cell tumors , presence of itgcn in adjacent tissue may suggest a negative cancer behavior .
, we aimed to assess the prevalence of itgcn in the patients who have underwent radical orchiectomy due to testicular tumor , as well as its correlations with pathologic features of concomitant testis cancer and patients ' epidemiologic characteristics . to our knowledge , this is the first report on itgcn in association with testicular germ cell tumor in our region , also the first study which is looking for its prognostic role .
the study population was the patients who underwent radical orchiectomy due to testis tumor from 2003 to 2015 .
the prevalence of itgcn was significantly lower in the patients with stage t1 than those with higher stages ( t2 ) . among the 150 patients with stage t1 , 62 ( 41% ) had itgcn , while 18 out of 29 patients ( 62% ) with stage t2 and t3 had itgcn ( p=0.03 ) .
