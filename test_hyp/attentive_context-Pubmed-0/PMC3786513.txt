we aimed to evaluate the carotid intima - media thickness ( cimt ) as an indicator of this risk in gck - mody patients aging 35 years or older and their unaffected relatives , who share a similar environment and lifestyle .
myocardial changes typical of ischemic heart disease described on echocardiography and/or ecg were detected in three of 27 patients with gck - mody and two of the 24 healthy control individuals ( p = 0.866 ) .
the prevalence of smokers and hypertensive patients was similar in both samples ( p = 1 ) .
our data support a conservative therapeutic approach for hyperglycemia in nonpregnant patients with gck - mody .
three study participants had suffered from myocardial infarction ( two with gck - mody and one control individual ) ( p = 0.895 ) in the past , and two had suffered from ischemic stroke ( one with gck - mody and one control individual ) .
no significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between patients and control individuals , with the exception of fasting blood glucose ( gck - mody 7.6  mmol / l , sd  1.2 ( 136.4  mg / dl ) ; controls 5.3  mmol / l , sd  0.3 ( 95.4  mg / dl ) ; p < 0.0001 ) and glycated hemoglobin hba1c ( gck - mody 6.9% ( sd  1.0 ) , 52  mmol / mol ( sd  10 ) ; controls 5.7% ( sd  0.4 ) , 39  mmol / mol ( sd  3 ) ; p < 0.0001 ) ( table 1 ) .
