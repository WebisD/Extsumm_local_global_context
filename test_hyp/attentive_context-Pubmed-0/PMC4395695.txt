therefore , this study compared energy 
 expenditure in the ybt , the functional dynamic single - limb balance test , in elderly people 
 with good and poor binocular visual acuity ( bva ) .
the effect size value of the reach distance and energy expenditure showed that 
 the results were large for the a ( 1.064 and 1.525 ) , pm ( 1.268 and 1.044 ) , pl directions 
 ( 1.187 and 1.104 ) and composite reach ( 1.412 ) in terms of the differences between the good 
 and poor bva groups .
the normalized reach distance ( % maxd ) in the good bva group ( a , 60.84.3 ; pm , 94.36.1 ; pl , 
 88.97.8 ) during the ybt in the three directions and composite reach ( 81.34.8 ) were 
 significantly longer ( p < 0.05 ) compared with the values in the poor bva group ( a , 
 55.65.9 ; pm , 84.29.9 ; pl , 81.75.4 ; composite , 73.86.2 ) . the energy expenditure 
 ( cm / s ) in the good bva group during the ybt in the three directions ( a , 
 413.8145.2 ; pm , 490.0189.4 ; pl , 585.8209.7 ) was significantly reduced ( p < 0.05 ) 
 compared with the values in the poor bva group ( a , 697.4231.6 ; pm , 698.8227.3 ; pl , 
 791.6182.7 ) .
