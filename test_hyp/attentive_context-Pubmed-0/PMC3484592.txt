in patients with hypotension after left pneumonectomy a high index of suspicion should be observed for diaphragmatic hernia during the whole postoperative period .
a 60 year - old man with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent a thoracotomy through double incision ( 5 and 7 intercostal spaces ) for left pleuro - pneumonectomy and diaphragmatic resection after chemotherapy . the pre operative chest computed tomography scan showed a pattern of centrolobular emphysema .
the altered postoperative physiology after pneumonectomy interventions can cause severe implications , especially in patients receiving adjuvant therapy for advanced lung cancer .  
gastric hernia is a rare postoperative complication usually diagnosed at the first postoperative chest xray .   in our case
this figure shows the diaphragmatic herniation ( the chest xray was performed immediately before cardiorespiratory arrest ) .
a thoracic epidural catheter was placed before anaesthesia induction and a mixture of ropivacaine 0.375% and fentanyl was used during the intervention and postoperative period .  
the chest x - ray showed gastric and spleen herniation through a diaphragmatic breach ( figure 2 ) .
the left pneumonectomy likely created a vacant space into which the stomach acutely herniated compressing the heart and creating a cardiac tamponade .
