we also employ the nudged - elastic 
 band ( neb ) technique to case study anomalies of molecular transition through 
 ultranarrow pores .
in addition to the use of molecular dynamics simulation and experimental 
 methods for calculation of molecular diffusion , we analyze the free 
 energy landscape of the system based on the computational method of 
 sarkisov to provide more insights into structural 
 heterogeneity and internal constrictions in the sic - dc carbon , which 
 have rate limiting effects on gas diffusion .
we 
 have investigated the heterogeneity of the energy landscape 
 of the amorphous structure of microporous silicon carbide derived 
 carbon using a representative atomistic hrmc model of the sic - dc . 
 the limiting free energy barrier , the percolating free energy threshold , 
 henry constant , and differential heat of adsorption of water , carbon 
 dioxide , methane , and argon have been determined in the limit of infinite 
 dilution using analysis of free energy landscape .
anisotropic diffusion of ch4 and co2 is found , and considered to be related 
 to structural heterogeneity and pore size distribution of sic - dc , 
 arising from unidimensional motion of the reaction interface during 
 chlorination of the sic precursor .
