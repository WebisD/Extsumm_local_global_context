b ) -transaminase - catalyzed asymmetric amine synthesis and common methods to shift the equilibrium to the product .
various examples , which have been provided to a significant extent by companies , demonstrate the applicability of -transaminases for the synthesis of valuable targets . detailed investigation of the substrate scope , as well as a well - understood mechanism and detailed crystallographic analysis of the catalysts ' protein structures , have built up a consolidated base for the application of transaminase enzymes on a laboratory scale , as well as on a pilot - plant scale .
the broad range of accepted ketone and aldehyde precursors , the robust reaction conditions , and the relatively easy preparation of the catalysts represent a highly attractive alternative to recent amination methodologies .
the company celgene demonstrated the first enantioselective production of chiral amines through kinetic resolution of a racemate on a 2.5 m scale . at around the same time investigations into -transaminases for synthetic applications also started in academia , revealing that one of the major problems to overcome was shifting the equilibrium , especially in the case of asymmetric synthesis ( scheme 1 , b ) , as well as inhibition by certain carbonyl compounds . in order to circumvent inhibition ,
