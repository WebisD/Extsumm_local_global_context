the objective of the study was to assess concentrations of oxidized low - density lipoproteins ( oxldl ) in peritoneal fluid ( pf ) of women with endometriosis .
concentrations of oxldl in pf of patients with endometriosis were significantly higher compared to women with serous ovarian cysts ( p = 0.03 ) .
however , no significant difference in the pf oxldl levels was found between patients with endometriosis and women with dermoid ovarian cysts ( p = 0.4 ) .
however , it can not be excluded that high oxldl levels are the result of more oxidant environment in the peritoneal cavity of patients with severe endometriosis than with less advanced disease .
pf oxldl concentration did not differ significantly between the subgroups of women in the follicular and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle ( me , range : 71.5 , 1.21470  ng / ml versus 80.3 , 16.71870  ng / ml , p = 0.5 ) .
levels of oxldl in pf of women with serous ovarian cysts were similar to those noted in patients with dermoid cysts ( figure 1 , table 1 ) . by analyzing concentrations of oxldl in pf of women with different stages of the disease
