this report documents for the first time the healing response following anti - vegf treatment of cnvs and highlights possible causes of treatment failure .
we report herein on the clinical outcome of bilateral surgical excisions of cnv in a pic case which failed anti - vegf treatment .
this is the first pathological study employing human tissue that points to pericytes as a potential critical target with the aggravating influence of inner choroidal chronic inflammation .
we also analyzed the clinical and anatomical implications of surgical removal of cnvs following treatment failure of anti - vegf agents .
there is one other report in the literature of excision of a cnv membrane following intravitreal injection of the anti - vegf agent bevacizumab , in which only avascular fibrous tissue was described pathologically .
electron microscopic evaluation was performed on the excised specimens in an attempt to elucidate the pathogenesis of the condition and the possible mechanisms of treatment failure .
a multifactorial etiology of ocular angiogenesis , including inflammation and mediators other than vegf , as well as the different levels of vascular maturation of the neovascular complex , has been proposed . to date , there is no report of the surgical management and ultrastructural study of cnv secondary to choroiditis following intravitreal anti - vegf treatment .
