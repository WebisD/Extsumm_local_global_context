in summary , we have developed a general method for the cross - coupling 
 of hindered primary amines with a range of ( hetero)aryl chlorides 
 and bromides .
, 
 it was found that oxidative addition for aryl chlorides and reductive 
 elimination for aryl bromides with the initial catalyst based on ligand l4 were rate - determining .
this transformation occurs under mild conditions and 
 provides the desired products in high yields utilizing two catalyst 
 systems .
herein , we describe the development of two related catalyst systems 
 that demonstrate high activity for the coupling of ,,-trisubstituted 
 primary amines 15 with a variety 
 of ( hetero)aryl halides .
ligand l7 was designed after analysis of the 
 reaction mechanism using the rpka method . rather than amine binding
the 
 availability of a general method to obtain a broad range of hindered 
 anilines by a pd - catalyzed c 
these observations lead to the development 
 of l7 , a biaryl(alkyl)arylphosphine ligand that greatly 
 accelerated the reaction with both aryl halides .
l7 is 
 the first example of a hybrid ( alkyl)aryl ligand that provides superior 
 results as compared to its analogues with identical alkyl- or arylphosphorus 
 substituents , offering another tunable 
 site for better control of catalyst activity .
