our results suggest that the correlation between tropical temperature and the co2 growth rate is caused by an assortment of covarying processes , including nee responses to temperature and drought stress as well as fire emissions in tropical and boreal forest ecosystems .
we found that the combined influence of the response of nee to drought and fire emissions accounted for more of the variability than direct temperature responses of nee when these drivers were considered simultaneously .
this result underscores the need to consider the full spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric co2 and to use a consistent transport - modeling framework to infer the sensitivities to temperature and drought stress in both models and observations .
accurate attribution of co2 variability is required to constrain coupled models combined influence of drought and fire exceed ecosystem responses to temperature temporal and spatial smoothing of co2 observations masks variability from fire
analysis of the climate drivers of co2 variability at seasonal , interannual , and decadal time scales may ultimately provide a path toward improved climate predictability in esms .
that earlier models may have had unrealistically large ( negative ) values of at least for the nonfire component of the tropical net ecosystem carbon balance .
