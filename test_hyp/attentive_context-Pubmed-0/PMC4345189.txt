we retrospectively reviewed seventeen infants with hydrocephalus who were treated in our department by etv from jul .
endoscopic third ventriculostomy is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of infantile hydrocephalus .
this study included 17 patients between the ages of 51 days and 337 days , with an average age of 143 days , 9 males and 8 females , 4 han people and 13 hui people .
of the 17 patients there were 5 cases with encephalitis history , 2 cases with cerebral hemorrhage , and 10 cases of congenital hydrocephalus . among the 10 cases with congenital hydrocephalus , were congenital aqueductal stenosis in 6 cases , chiari malformation in 2 cases , and dandy walker syndrome in 2 cases .
considering all the benefits mentioned above , we conclude etv is the best treatment choice for infantile hydrocephalus
of the 17 postoperative infants the skull and ventricular system of 7 cases shrank : 1 case with encephalitis history , 1 cases with cerebral hemorrhage , 4 cases with congenital aqueductal stenosis , and 1 case with chiari malformation , yielding an effective rate of 41.2% . 1 case failed because of severe ventricle inflammatory adhesion , excessive exudation , and vague basilar artery . in the remaining 9 cases
