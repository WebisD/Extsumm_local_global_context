participation in the sts national database,  operative mortality stratified by the five sts - eacts ( european association for cardiothoracic surgery ) mortality categories, and  risk adjustment in congenital heart surgery ( rachs-1 ) pediatric heart surgery mortality . the sts states on its website that  sts believes the public has a right to know the quality of the surgical outcomes , and considers public reporting an ethical responsibility of the specialty .
since it is methodologically based on the jcvsd , the ncd represents an interface between medical databases and board certification systems , which is its point of difference from the sts national database . in 2014 , a new organization for medical board certification was established in japan that , beginning in 2017 , will certify all medical boards in close collaboration with medical associations .
clinicians are responsible for patient safety and quality improvement , and the database will aid in achieving these goals . as reinertsen   stated , to truly improve quality , the system must , 1 ) eliminate unnecessary variation ( standardize processes ) , and 2 ) achieve and document continuous improvement ( in care processes and outcomes ) . in recent years , the importance of  certainty , not excellence of operations , and that of the concept of structure , process and outcome   have been emphasized , and multiple approaches , for instance , postgraduate education systems , reporting systems of malpractice to prevent recurrence , introduction of information technology , introduction of simulators , ebm , and other techniques , have been used for patient safety .
