the aim of the current study was to demonstrate changing trends of colorectal cancer incidence according to age group , sex , and anatomical location .
the male - to - female irrs showed a significant increase between 1999 and 2009 for overall colorectal cancer ( 1.20 in 1999 to 1.51 in 2009 ) , distal colon cancer ( 1.32 to 1.60 ) , and rectal cancer ( 1.22 to 1.67 ) , whereas the irr for proximal colon cancer did not show a significant change ( 1.09 to 1.16 ) ( table 3 ) .
the male - to - female irrs were higher for distal colon and rectal cancer and increased between 1999 and 2009 due to more rapid changes in male colorectal cancer incidence .
increases in the proportion of colon cancer may be explained by a transition in risk factors for subsites and the effect of colorectal cancer screening programs .
the rapid increase in colorectal cancer incidence in korea between 1999 and 2009 is mainly attributed to increases in colon cancer , especially distal colon cancer .
age ( five - year intervals ) and sex - specific incidence rates and the number of cases of colorectal cancer between 1999 and 2009 were obtained from the korea national cancer incidence database .
