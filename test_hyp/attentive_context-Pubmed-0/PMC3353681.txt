rocm invades vessels , soft tissue , nerves , bone and cartilage producing tissue infarction and ultimately leading to tissue necrosis and vessel thrombosis.4 we present a case of an immunocompetent patient who survived rocm due to saksenaea vasiformis , and review the literature of this fatal condition .
a 40-year - old healthy male presented with painful swelling in the left eye for two weeks .
in contrast , only 61% of cases treated with amphotericin b deoxycholate only , 57% of cases that underwent only surgery and only 3% of untreated patients survived.1 in conclusion , diagnosis of rocm in immunocompetent patients is always misleading and possibly causes delay in treatment . it is essential to alert the managing ophthalmologist of the emergence of this rare disease among healthy individuals .
mucormycosis can cause severe , sometimes fatal disease in susceptible individuals with uncontrolled diabetic ketoacidosis , neutropenia , chronic glucocorticoid use , hematological malignancy , chronic malnutrition and burn patients.13 rhino - orbito - cerebral mucormycosis ( rocm ) is an uncommon infection in immunocompetent hosts .
mucormycosis is a rare but aggressive opportunistic fungal infection that is commonly caused by members of the family mucoraceae that include rhizopus , rhizomucor , mucor and absidia .
