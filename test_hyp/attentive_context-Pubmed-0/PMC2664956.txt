the sequencing of several genomes and the hapmap project , coupled to high - density genotyping technologies and new statistical tools , have made possible the systematic interrogation of the genetic basis of complex traits in humans .
these discoveries infuse us with optimism about the potential for understanding the key homeostatic pathways that are causally related to these disorders , which could lead to new drug development and better patient management . at the same time , these studies have presented us with some surprising findings .
firstly , the total sum of disease risk attributed to common variants detected by genome - wide association studies ( gwass ) remains modest , raising a problem analogous to the astrophysicists ' search for ' dark matter ' .
largely consistent with the community 's expectations , the past two years have seen a logarithmically expanding number of genomic regions associated with a broad range of phenotypes ( see   for an updated list ) .
population- and genetic - based arguments can suggest that certain alleles cause certain phenotypes , as has been shown by medical resequencing of candidate genes in patients at the extremes of high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) plasma levels . nonetheless , even in these examples , in vitro assays that tested the functional consequences of the mutations were necessary for the researchers to present compelling arguments . given these observations , it might be prudent to refocus our efforts on how to evaluate the physiological impact of genetic and genomic variation on gene function , because without that ability , the contribution of additional gwass on understanding disease mechanisms will remain limited . given the plethora of in vitro and in vivo tools available to the community
