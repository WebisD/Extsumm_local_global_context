this injury has a serious effect of the pertinent spinal cord segment with the breakdown of connections and networks and the development of a spinal cord scar .
a spinal cord injury that affects mainly the final common motor pathway and the primary sensory trajectories occurs as the spinal nerve roots are torn or avulsed from their medullary attachments . in humans
this type of injury will in the future be considered for similar type of surgical strategy in man as for the spinal cord injured patients control over pelvic organs has the highest priority .
this occurs most frequently in traction injuries to the brachial plexus but also in trauma to the lumbosacral plexus and cauda equina as well as conus medullaris .
disintegration of the shorter central part of the sensory axon and most of the motoneuron axon with a dying back into the spinal cord follows . within a few weeks after such a trauma
root avulsion interrupts the local transverse segmental spinal cord motor and sensory nerve fibers and is a longitudinal spinal cord injury .
the biological background to such exceptions to the rule of unsuccessful regeneration in the cns remains partly elusive . a human surgical strategy for the repair of avulsed ventral roots and
