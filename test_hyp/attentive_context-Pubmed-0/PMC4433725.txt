further , the adaptive fitness of tasters is higher than that of non - tasters for all phenotypes , which speaks of adaptive value of taster pheno - type . therefore , understanding the nature of the variation in bitter taste perception and its relationship to diet and other behavior aspects may have important implications for human health .
human infants show an innate pleasure response to sweet taste , but dislike bitterness and reject bitter - tasting foods ( 30 ) .
the highest fit genotype is taken as having fitness value of one , and the fraction of fitness of each genotype with fitness of highest trait is taken as relative fitness of the other genotypes ayala ( 29 ) .
two major forms of this bitter receptor gene were identified in most of the world s populations , designated as the 
the aim of the present study was to analyze the gene frequency , relative fitness value and threshold distribution for phenylthiocarbamide among some muslim populations of uttar pradesh , india to show their genetic heterogeneity . males and females of different populations have also been compared for the taste sensitivity of this trait .
allele frequency for the non - taster ( t ) varies in different populations . the allelic frequency for the non - taster ( t ) for males and females
