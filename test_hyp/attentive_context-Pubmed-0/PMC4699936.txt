necrotizing sialometaplasia of the hard palate re - occurred on the contralateral side after 5 months .
a 36-year - old woman was referred to the gangnam severance hospital ( seoul , korea ) by a private practice endodontist .
our patient was not definitively diagnosed upon the second occurrence , but the second lesion may have been caused by the patient 's heavy smoking habit , because she had experienced no dental events such as the use of local anesthesia .
it is histologically similar to mucoepidermoid carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but is a benign disease that spontaneously heals within 4 to 10 weeks .
however , in our case , there was a second occurrence on the contralateral side with a time lapse between the first and second occurrences , a presentation that is thought to be quite rare .
the second lesion was still within the initial period of necrotizing when observed , and we therefore conducted an incisional biopsy including both normal and necrotized tissues to confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing sialometaplasia . necrotizing sialometaplasia occurs unilaterally in 71% of previously - reported cases , and on both sides of the median suture line of the hard palate in 12% of cases2 .
