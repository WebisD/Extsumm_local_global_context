we present a rare case of spontaneous rectal perforation after uncomplicated nerve sparing endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy in a patient with a previous history of rectal polypectomy at the perforation site .
this conservative therapy for such rectal perforations is indicated if the patient 's general condition remains stable without any signs of infection .
rectal polypectomy causes thinning ( or even perforation ) of the rectal wall in addition to thermic injury at the polypectomy site .

adequate time interval should be given to allow healing and avoid adding further thermal wall damage which may obscure healing leading to complications like fistula .
we present a rare case of spontaneous rectal perforation after uncomplicated nseerpe in a patient with a previous history of rectal polypectomy at the perforation site , which was successfully treated conservatively .
intra - operative use of an intrarectal device / air should be emphasized in difficult cases .
however in the presence of a large perforation , generalized peritonitis , ongoing sepsis or if the patient condition deteriorates surgery is indicated .
