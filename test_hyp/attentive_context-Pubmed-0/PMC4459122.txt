in previous works we compared the performances of an x - ray tes microcalorimeter under ac and dc bias by measuring the iv characteristic , the noise , the impedance and the x - ray response at perpendicular magnetic field b=0 .
the tests were carried out both with an sron pixel and a gsfc pixel    . with respect to the dc bias case , under ac bias we observe a smaller ( about 15% ) current output at small voltage bias low in the transition , a low tes current and temperature sensitivity , a slightly worse integrated nep resolution and about a factor two x - ray resolution degradation . in order to better understand the reasons for the suboptimal performance of the tess under ac bias we thoroughly studied the effect of the perpendicular magnetic field and the voltage bias on the detector response . here
a  possible interpretation of this effect is given by comparing the detector and the ac read - out to an rf - squid . in this analogy
the tes is seen as a weak - link in a superconducting ring weakly coupled to an lc resonator .
a  strong dependency of the baseline noise on the bias voltage is at the origin of the non reproducible results obtained in the past . in the iv curve under ac bias
