a 48-year - old man presented with several episodes of loss of consciousness in 2005 .
we report here two cases of patients who benefited from the addition of bevacizumab to temsirolimus .
a 54-year - old man presented with hematuria revealing a left kidney tumour in january 2004 .
treatment of metastatic kidney cancer has changed dramatically over the past years with the use of vegf - targeted therapies and mtor inhibitors . however , resistance occurs .
the brain metastases were treated with gamma - knife radiosurgery . in 2006 , he developed lung metastases and mediastinal lymph nodes . in march 2007 , the mediastinal lymph nodes increased and he was started on sunitinib ( 50 mg 4 weeks on treatment and 2 weeks off ) .
however , some reports already mention the development of polyglobulia with anti - angiogenesis agent . this effect may correct a pre - existing anaemia   .
there were probably several causes to his anaemia ( a side effect of temsirolimus and the disease ) . in january 2009
the lesions were stable but the lymphangitic infiltration was extensive and the patient still experienced dyspnoea .
these two cases show the effect of adding bevacizumab to temsirolimus for patients who were progressing on the mtor inhibitor .
