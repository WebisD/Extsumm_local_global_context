response to hbv vaccine ( i.e. anti - hbs levels > 10 iu / ml ) between iranian dental workers has been studied extensively and 89.2% to 94.4% of dentists showed reasonable levels of anti - hbs following one to three doses of hbv vaccine ( 11 - 14 ) . in the largest iranian survey , of 598 participants , 35 ( 5.9% ) were nonimmune ( anti - hbs < 10
the objectives of the present study were to assess the hbv vaccine coverage and investigate the responsiveness to hbv vaccine as well as socio - demographic data , health - related and occupational factors and other correlates of vaccine responsiveness in iranian dentists and dental staff .
nevertheless , the mean anti - hbs titers were 24.89 ( 95% ci : 11.16 - 55.52 ) , 100.32 ( 95% ci : 70.52 - 142.72 ) and 107.04 ( 95% ci : 96.82 - 118.33 ) for subjects who received one , two and three doses of vaccine , respectively ( p values between 1 and 2 ; 2 and  3 doses : 0.006 , and 0.98 , respectively , results not shown ) .
356/542 ( 65.7% ) of dentists who had received their third dose of vaccination less than five years before the study were completely immune ( anti - hbs > 100 iu / ml ) ; this rate was significantly higher than individuals who had completed all three recommended doses in a period more than 5 years prior to the study 279/491 ( 56.8% ) ( p = 0.003 ) ( table 1 ) .
