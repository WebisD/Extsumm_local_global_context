therefore , we sought to investigate specifically ( a ) working memory capacity and auditory segregation using pairs of concurrent auditory stimuli and ( b ) the possible influence of working memory capacity on auditory segregation in children with apd and subsequently compare them with those in healthy controls .
the findings of the current study revealed that the children with apd were significantly poorer than were the control group in both working memory capacity measures and auditory stream segregation according to the concurrent minimum audible angle . working memory capacity deficits in children with apd
means and sds of the non - word repetition and forward and backward digit span tasks for the group with audio processing disorder ( apd ) and the control group .
bamiou found that the working memory capacity of their children with apd , as measured by non - word repetition and forward and backward digit span tasks , was significantly poorer than that of their control group .
poor working memory capacity in children with apd may be the possible cause of poor performance in the segregating and grouping of incoming information and in turn poor speech perception in complex and noisy environments .
