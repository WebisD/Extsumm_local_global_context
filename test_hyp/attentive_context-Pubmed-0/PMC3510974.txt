therefore , the aim of this study was to examine the effect of low - gl diet ( gl = 6777 , 36% energy as fat , and 42% as carbohydrate ) , with having higher percentage of fat and lower amount of carbohydrate than conventional diabetics diet on cardiovascular risk factors changes in poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients .
cholesterol and tg concentrations were 205.9  21.6 mg/ dl and 181.5  22.2 mg / dl and reduced to 182.6  18.2 and 161.6  16.7 , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
fbs concentration , hba1c percentage , weight , and bmi were significantly different between the values before and after intervention ( p < 0.001 ) , which reduced as follows : fasting blood glucose by 28.1  12.5 mg / dl ( 16.6% ) , hba1c by 1.1  0.3% , weight by 3.3  1 kg , and bmi by 1.2  0.4 kg / m ( p < 0.001 ) .
the mechanism of low gl diet for weight loss is due to its effect on oxidation elevation of nutrients in muscles rather than storing them in white adipose tissue , a process that increases satiety , delayed return of hunger , or decreased ad libitum food intake and weight loss .
