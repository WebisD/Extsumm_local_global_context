in summary , oncologists faced various difficulties in treatment of patients with rare cancers , including the lack of clinical practice guidelines and personal experience , lack of approved treatment options , and reimbursement issues .
they were generally supportive of recent recommendations by multi - stakeholder initiatives as well as professional societies for development of clear clinical practice guidelines , flexible reimbursement guidelines , and a national rare cancer registry . however , there was only moderate endorsement for referrals to high - volume centers or encouragement of off - label treatments .
more than half of our study participants noted the need for development of clinical practice guidelines ( 66.0% ) , and more flexible reimbursement guidelines for treatment of rare cancers ( 52.9% ) .
insights into the general attitudes of oncologists gained through our nationwide survey of representative samples would be helpful in development of clinical practices and public health policies in rare cancer treatment and research .
this study was part of a nationwide survey conducted in order to explore views regarding medical care and treatments among physicians involved in cancer care .
more than 30% of respondents felt that the establishment of a national registry ( 47.4% ) , a referral system to high volume centers for accumulating treatment experience ( 35.5% ) , research incentives ( 33.8% ) , and government initiative and support for research in rare cancer ( 30.2% ) would improve patient care . only a small proportion of respondents endorsed solutions involving off - label treatments for rare cancers ( 21.0% ) and legislation mandating budget allocations for development of drugs for treatment of rare cancers ( 13.1% ) ( table 4 ) .
