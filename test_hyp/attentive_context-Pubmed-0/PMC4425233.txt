given the discrepancies found in the literature , and the lack of studies assessing hrqol in portuguese diabetic patients , the aim of this cross - sectional study was to assess the relationship between hrqol and age , sex , bmi , type of dm and treatment regimens , and duration of dm .
our findings suggest that being female , obese , having type 2 dm and taking insulin , and having diabetes for a longer period of time are characteristics associated with worse age - adjusted hrqol in patients with dm . globally , physical functioning and vitality were the dimensions more related to these demographic and clinical variables .
diabetic women had worse hrqol in terms of physical functioning , general health , vitality , social functioning , role - emotional , and mental health than men , and evidenced a tendency in the same direction in terms of role - physical and bodily pain .
an increased duration of dm ( measured according to the categories presented in table 1 ) was associated with lower hrqol in terms of physical functioning ( rs = 0.271 , p=0.002 ) , role - physical ( rs = 0.209 , p=0.020 ) , general health ( rs = 0.372 , p<0.001 ) , vitality ( rs = 0.312 , p<0.001 ) , role - emotional ( rs = 0.224 , p=0.012 ) , and mental health ( rs = 0.197 , p=0.028 ) . in terms of social functioning , there was a tendency in the same direction ; however , it did not reach statistical significance ( rs = 0.160 , p=0.077 ) .
