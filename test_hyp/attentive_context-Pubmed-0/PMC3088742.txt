we report the case of a woman who presented with a splenic lesion 11 months after radical nephrectomy .
a 70-year - old caucasian female presented with a 4-week history of malaise and fatigue .
splenic metastasis generally indicates late dissemination of disease , and it is unusual to find isolated splenic lesions from solid organ malignancies , with fewer than 25 cases reported worldwide .
a splenectomy is an effective and safe option for symptomatic relief and prevention of future complications .
the most common primaries are lung cancer , cutaneous malignant melanoma , and breast cancer .
metastasis to the spleen is infrequent but varies greatly from series to series ( 1.6 to 30% ) , depending on the thoroughness of examination and selection of cases .
this renal tumour had been incidentally discovered on a follow - up abdominal ct scan she was having following a total abdominal hysterectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy for stage 1c endometrial carcinoma 4 years prior .
it was uncertain whether this was indeed a true metastasis or a local recurrence of her previous left renal tumour .
after discussion in a multidisciplinary setting , although an uncommon event , the splenic lesion was thought likely to be an isolated splenic metastasis from her previous rcc and resection was recommended .
