intra - tracheal tube fire is rare and yet a critical emergency that can cause fatal complications . despite numerous studies on the cause and prevention of fire ,
a 54-year - old male patient with a height of 170 cm and weight of 77 kg visited a private hospital due to a headache and weakness in left muscle that started the day before his hospital visit . during the examination ,
, when a tube fire does occur , it is very important to minimize additional damage or burns in the respiratory tract through appropriate and fast responses , and to determine a suitable time for extubation according to the specific situation .
however , chee and benumof   argue that immediate extubation is not always the best option , considering that the damage from the fire is minimal in most of the cases of fire reported until now ; most of the patients undergoing tracheostomies have difficulties in maintaining their airways due to edema , which is the leading cause of morbidity and the increase in the death rate in accidents involving anesthesia is hypoventilation and hypoxia . in our case , immediate extubation and intubation of the endotracheal tube were done , but in post - operative examinations , there were no problems with the trachea itself and there was no chemical damage .
