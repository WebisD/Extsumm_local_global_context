this study was designed to investigate the complex symptoms of hyperandrogenic disorders and correlations between metabolism and hyperandrogenism in patients with pcos from an outpatient reproductive medicine clinic in china .
the or of acne was significantly lower in pcos patients with hyperandrogenism ( p = 0.01 ) .
the or was 2.27 ( 95%cis : 1.22 - 4.2 , p = 0.009 ) for overweight , which suggested that women with a high bmi had a significantly higher risk of pcos .
homa - ir was similar in pcos patients with signs of hyperandrogenism ( hs group ) to that in patients without signs ( t = 0.026 , p = 0.967 ) .
it is therefore critical for pcos patients with clinical signs of androgen excess to maintain a normal body weight .
the ha group had higher bmi and lower shbg than the nha group ( p = 0.017 , p = 0.018 , table 2 ) and a higher risk of overweight ( or = 4.41 , 95%ci : 1.789.67 , p = 0.001 ) .
however , the differences in serum total testosterone and shbg were insignificant between pcos patients with and without the symptom of hyperandrogenism .
