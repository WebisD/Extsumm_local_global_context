the main purpose of this case report is to describe the blood supply variations in the upper limb and to analyze the actual formation of the superficial palmar arch in the palm region .
after that the ma may form the spa ( claassen h , schmitt o , wree a . due to its close proximity to the median , the median artery nerve can be involved in several clinical disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome , anterior interosseous nerve syndrome and pronator syndrome . in view of the described variations
, we believe that the knowledge of this unusual blood supply is extremely important , especially for the clinical or surgical practice .
the case was described after a routine dissection during the anatomy class with students from the department of anatomy , histology and pathology at the medical faculty of the university of sofia .
the derivatives of the forearm artery are median ( colligate with the deep branch of the radial artery , the branch of the primitive avail artery ) and the ulnar artery , which anastomoses with the terminal trunk of the primitive axial artery ( ulnar system ) .
were observed and documented vascular variations of the brachial artery and composition of the superficial artery arc .
