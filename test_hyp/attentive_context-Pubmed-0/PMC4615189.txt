we also have also uncovered a potential functional consequence of nuclear envelope architecture defects in muscle tissue .
specifically , examination of nuclear envelope ultrastructure in tissues from mouse muscular dystrophy models , as well as patient samples , should be informative .
the two membranes of the nuclear envelope , the inner nuclear membrane ( inm ) and outer nuclear membrane ( onm ) , are separated by a uniform distance of 3050  nm . to facilitate the import and export of cargos , the inm and onm meet at junctions containing nuclear pore complexes ( npcs ) .
the role of nuclear envelope defects in a wide - ranging collection of human diseases is drawing increased attention to this complex cellular structure .
our work has clarified the prevailing model for the role of sun proteins in nuclear envelope spacing .
nonetheless , our results open a new area for exploration in better understanding the relationship between muscle disease and nuclear envelope architecture .
the observation that the absence of linc complexes causes nuclear envelope architecture defects in cells under strain could have implications for understanding some human diseases . in c. elegans , nuclear envelope defects
high pressure freezing and electron microscopy techniques are well established in c. elegans , which allowed us to expand our observations to a variety of tissues and developmental stages .
