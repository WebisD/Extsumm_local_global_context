increased aortic stiffness can be observed in patients with nccm with moderate to severe hf .
this study was designed to examine aortic stiffness in nccm patients and to compare these results to age- and gender - matched controls .
 values were 3.5    1.1 , 7.9    5.5 , and 10.4    1.8 , respectively ( p  <  0.001 ) .
3a interobserver correlation ( r  =  0.88 , p  <  0.01 ) between aortic systolic diameters in nccm patients .
aortic stiffness index (  ) was significantly increased in nccm patients compared to controls . for controls , nccm patients with moderate hf , and nccm patients with severe hf ,
nccm noncompaction cardiomyopathy a interobserver correlation ( r  =  0.88 , p  <  0.01 ) between aortic systolic diameters in nccm patients .
nccm is a recently recognized disorder characterized by a loosened , spongy myocardium associated with a high incidence of progressive systolic and diastolic hf . in recent studies , alterations have been demonstrated in arterial function in patients with chronic hf   . to the best of authors s knowledge ,
b interobserver correlation ( r  =  0.9 , p  <  0.01 ) between aortic diastolic diameters in nccm patients .
