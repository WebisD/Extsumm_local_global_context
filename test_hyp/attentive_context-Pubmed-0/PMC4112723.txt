psoriasis is a chronic , recurrent , inflammatory cutaneous disease that affects 1%3% of the general population .
later , t - cells were identified as crucial to the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis.4 nowadays , it is accepted that genetic , environmental , and immunologic factors are involved in the disease onset and course . moreover , different cells are important key players at different stages , and the onset of psoriasis is similar to an immune reaction.5 the t helper ( th)1 pathway is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis , as suggested by the increase in cytokines of this axis , such as interferon ( ifn)- , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf)- , interleukin ( il)-2 , and il-12 , observed in plaques and in the serum of patients with psoriasis.68 levels of these cytokines have been correlated with severity of psoriasis,6,9 and the success of some therapies was associated with deviation of th1 to a th2 response.10 currently , psoriasis is known to be a complex disease in which the cytokine network is disturbed , and the il-23/th17 axis , as well as the th1 pathway , appear to be crucial for its pathogenic mechanisms.11,12 t - cell cytokines induce proliferation and activation of keratinocytes , also producing several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that sustain and amplify the inflammatory response by recruiting , retaining , and activating immune cells in the skin .
