thus , this study sought to determine if systemic markers of vascular function , inflammation and oxidative stress are influenced by the clinical syndromes and aetiologic subtype of acute ischaemic stroke .
other factors , including stroke severity , pre - morbid inflammation and co - morbidity may explain variations among groups of participants with different subtypes of acute ischaemic stroke .
these data suggest that stroke aetiology and clinical syndrome may not be important independent determinants of the degree of systemic inflammation , oxidative stress or endothelial function in acute ischaemic stroke .

in addition to stroke severity , systolic blood pressure varies in patients with stroke of different aetiologic and clinical subtypes .
finding that inflammation does vary according to stroke clinical subtype appears to be confounded by stroke severity , given that the aetiologic and clinical subtypes were not associated with the degree of systemic inflammation after control for stroke severity .
129 patients with acute ischaemic stroke were recruited to the study , a mean of 63 hours ( sd 36 hours , minimum 6 hours , and maximum 192 hours ) after the onset of symptoms .
