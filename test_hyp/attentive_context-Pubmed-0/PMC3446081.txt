, we aimed to determine the therapeutic effect of synbiotics ( combination of probiotics containing strains of l. casei , l. rhamnosus , s. thermophilus , b. breve , l. acidophilus , b. infantis , and fructooligo - saccharide as prebiotic ) on childhood constipation .
also , abdominal pain and painful defecation per week decreased ( p=0.6 , p=0.9 respectively ) similarly and there was no statistically significant difference between groups .
the frequency of bms per week increased in all groups , the highest rise occurring in group c ( p=0.03 ) .
improvement in stool consistency and decrease in number of fecal incontinence episodes happened in all groups ( p=0.2 , p=0.3 respectively ) without any statistically significant difference .
according to this rct , synbiotic have got beneficial effects on symptoms of childhood constipation similar to liquid paraffin without any side effects and synbiotic is an effective adjunct to liquid paraffin to improve bms .
group a received 1.5 ml / kg / day oral liquid paraffin plus placebo , group b received 1 sachet synbiotic per day ( restore 1x10 cfu/1 sachet , protexin co , uk ) .
no side effects were reported in group b but in group a 18 patients and in group c 21 patients had seepage ( p<0.001 ) .
