to our knowledge , this is the first report on embryonic mirna modulation , following paternal exposure to environmental contaminants .
following paternal acute exposure to b[a]p four days prior to fertilization , we studied the global mirna expression profile of the developing mouse embryo . we demonstrate that genome - wide mirna expression profiling studies can be performed on a very limited number of cells and that early embryonic transcription of multiple mirnas is affected by b[a]p exposure of the fertilizing sperm .
the functional implications of early xenobiotic induced suppressed or enhanced single mirna expression profiles in developing embryos are not well understood ; however , given the broad array of gene transcripts targeted by mirnas , the perturbations are likely , at some level , to be detrimental to the development of the embryo .
to reduce the likelihood of such errors , we narrowed and refined the list of target genes by comparing them with publically available gene expression data . in conclusion , preconceptional paternal exposure to b[a]p may affect mirna expression in the developing mouse embryo .
still , the study of gene and mirna expression profiles in developing embryos descending from exposed fathers , as exemplified in this report , could open up new avenues in our understanding of sublethal transgenerational effects of environmental exposure .
