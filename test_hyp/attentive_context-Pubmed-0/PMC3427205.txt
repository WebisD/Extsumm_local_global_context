grant and peiris investigated vitamin d s role in explaining disease disparities between aas and was in general
data from the third national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes iii ) were used to investigate the role of racial disparity from colorectal cancer ; adding vitamin d deficiency to the model attenuated the mortality risk associated with being black by a statistically significant 40% .
considerable disparities in cancer survival rates exist between african americans ( aas ) and white americans ( was ) .
. this paper surveys the literature on cancer disparities for aas and was as well as the literature on epidemiological studies on vitamin d and cancer to see whether differences in serum 25(oh)d concentrations might explain many of the otherwise - unaccounted - for residual disparities .
we inspected the results in the papers , preferring those with disparities in survival that included all three factors  ses , stage at diagnosis , and treatment , in addition to race  over those including fewer or none of these factors .
the dose  response relation for vitamin d has been derived from observational studies for breast and colorectal cancer . for
in addition , papers reporting cancer survival with respect to serum 25(oh)d concentration were also sought .
