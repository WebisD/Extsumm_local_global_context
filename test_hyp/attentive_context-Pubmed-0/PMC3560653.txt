particularly , it is necessary to investigate the clinical impact of this method in avoiding slnb , especially in cases when percutaneous sentinel node cnb is negative , without primary carcinoma peritumoral vascular invasion , in clinically node - negative breast disease patients .
using gamma probe combined with ultrasound- ( us ) guided percutaneous core needle biopsy ( cnb ) could increase the accuracy of identifying the sentinel node and allow a proper histopathologic diagnosis in order to avoid further slnb .
further studies should investigate the definitive role of this method in pre - treatment breast cancer staging .
the same is also true for the pre - treatment imaging ( with or without interventional procedures on the axillary node ) , characterized by a poor negative predictive value   .
the purpose of this pilot study was to assess this new pre - operative diagnostic approach .
considering the therapeutic consequences , involvement of the sentinel node by metastatic disease in breast cancer patients is of great interest to the breast surgeon in order to plan the surgical approach .
in conclusion , gamma probe - assisted sonographic localization associated with cnb of the sentinel node in early breast cancer patients could be a feasible and accurate new method .
