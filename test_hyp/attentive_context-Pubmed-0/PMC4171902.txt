the study was an out - patient department ( opd ) based prospective cohort , observational study in which 305 women were randomly selected and screened on opd basis by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) levels ( cutoff level 0.10 - 2.50 miu / ml ) as per recent guidelines .
this shows statistically significant association abnormal tsh values with adverse pregnancy outcomes ( p < 0.001 ) . considering the route of delivery , 88.85% women had normal delivery , out of them 0.36% were hyperthyroid , 5.5% were hypothyroid rest were euthyroid .
in abnormal perinatal outcomes 6.2% women had lower segment caesarean section ( lscs ) out of them 73.68% were euthyroid and 26.31% were hypothyroid .
this prospective screening of thyroid function in a cohort of unselected pregnant women shows that high - risk women ( with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders or a personal history of other autoimmune diseases ) have more significant ( p < 0.001 ) increased risk of hypothyroidism ( subclinical or overt ) during early pregnancy .
these women were followed till term and subsequent delivery to study the effect on maternal and perinatal outcome .
