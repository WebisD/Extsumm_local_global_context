the mean static compliance after 1 , 2 , and 3 h , respectively , was 63.0  18.7 mmhg , 75.6  25.4 mmhg , and 70.4  28.0 mmhg , with a significant difference in results between hour 1 and hour 2 ( p = 0.029).in most of the evlp procedures , the perfusion time was 180 minutes ; in only one case was the perfusion time 240 minutes .
a comparative evaluation of the lung biopsy samples collected before and after evlp showed that , in three cases , there was worsening of edema and formation of visible thrombi .
ex vivo lung perfusion ( evlp ) is a novel strategy for reconditioning lungs , with a view to increasing the number of viable organs for transplantation and to reducing the mortality of patients awaiting a transplant
there were no statistically significant differences among the three time points evaluated ( 1 h , 2 h , and 3 h after the initiation of ex vivo perfusion ) . 
 
discard was associated with radiological changes , and in two cases in which the pao2/fio2 ratio was satisfactory , the lungs were discarded either because of indefinite histology for brain neoplasm ( this being the cause of brain death ) or because the poor clinical condition of the recipient precluded transplantation ( table 1 ) .
