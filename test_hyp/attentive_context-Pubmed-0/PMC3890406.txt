after 1 year of treatment with menatetrenone , bmd at the lumbar spine and hip were significantly increased in chinese postmenopausal osteoporotic women , and that effect was comparable to alfacalcidol .

this 1-year study was therefore designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of menatetrenone for the treatment of osteoporosis in chinese postmenopausal women in comparison with alfacalcidol treatment . since the study involved osteoporotic women , a placebo control was not used , and alfacalcidol was chosen as a positive drug control to demonstrate the noninferiority of these two drugs .
the present study investigated the efficacy and safety of menatetrenone in chinese postmenopausal osteoporotic women . a significant increase in bmd by 1.2% and 2.7% at the lumbar spine and trochanter , respectively , from baseline and a significant decrease in oc and ucoc by 38.7% and 82.3% , respectively , from baseline were observed with menatetrenone treatment .
m and 0.9% in group a ) and joint pain ( 6.8% in group m and 3.4% in group a ) , which were mild and showed no difference between the two groups .
