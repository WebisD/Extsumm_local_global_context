the treatment of hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection has evolved from peginterferon alfa ( pegifn ) plus ribavirin ( rbv)based regimens to combinations of alloral , directacting antivirals ( daa ) , including daclatasvir  a pangenotypic ns5a inhibitor ( hcv genotypes 16 in vitro )  and the ns3 protease inhibitor , asunaprevir ( active against hcv genotypes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 in vitro ) . the efficacy and safety of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in combination has been assessed in multiple phase 3 studies , including the multicohort hallmarkdual study in treatmentnaive and pegifn / rbvineligible / intolerant hcv genotype 1binfected patients from 18 countries , including israel 1 . the sustained virologic response rate at posttreatment week 12 ( svr12 ) in the overall population of hallmarkdual following treatment with daclatasvir 60 mg once daily in combination with asunaprevir 100 mg twice daily administered orally for 24 weeks was 84% ( 542/643 ) and a comparable rate in patients from israel was observed ( overall , 82% [ 9/11 ] ; prior null responders , 3/3 ; pegifn / rbv ineligible / intolerant , 6/8 ) .
, this case study demonstrates that hcv genotype 1binfected patients experiencing virologic failure with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy have potential retreatment options , including regimens containing a component with a shared mechanism of action as the initial treatment .
