this retrospective study collected data from 42 consecutive patients ( 82 eyes ) with complete clinical data who underwent v4c - icl implantation at the affiliated hospital of zunyi medical college ( zunyi , china ) between november 2014 and november 2015 .
postoperative intraocular pressure was stable , and no vision - associated complications were found during the follow - up period . however , because v4c - icl implantation alters aqueous circulation , it remains to be determined whether v4c - icl implantation produces long - term effect on intraocular pressure and ecd .
the average age in patients with halos was 25.5  4.3 years , which was not significantly different from those without halos ( 23.2  5.0 years ) ( p = 0.702 ) .
therefore , in this study , we conducted a questionnaire to investigate the effects of v4c - icl implantation on myopic patients ' vision - related daily activities .
the average preoperative spherical equivalent was 11.55  3.52  d ( range , 5.75  d to 16.25  d ) . the average spherical equivalent was 0.12  0.33  d ( range , 1.00 to 0.50  d ) and the residual astigmatism was 0.18  0.32  d ( range , 0.25 to 1.25  d ) at 3 months after patients operations , excluding those patients with preexisting astigmatism who did not receive the implanted astigmatic v4c - icl model and required preservation of astigmatic power .
