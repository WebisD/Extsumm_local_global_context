therefore , more attention and care should be given during prenatal counseling , as well as more active therapeutic intervention taken when necessary with closer fetal monitoring , with the objective to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes in gdm patients with abnormal fbg or high 50-g gct values .
the risks of macrosomia , lga , and neonatal hypoglycemia increased with fasting hyperglycemia and higher 50-g gct values .
the group with 50-g gct level of 140 to 159  mg / dl was found to be associated with macrosomia ( or : 4.31 , 95% ci : 1.4213.13 , p = 0.010 ) and neonatal hypoglycemia ( or : 17.27 , 95% ci : 2.03147.12 , p = 0.009 ) when compared against the normal group .
the purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between perinatal outcomes and 50-g gct values as well as fbg among gdm women .
as a result , 307 patients were diagnosed with gdm ( gdm group ) and 496 showed false - positive result ( impaired glucose tolerance group ) .
the subgroup in the 160 to 179  mg / dl range showed significant or for macrosomia ( or : 5.95 , 95% ci : 1.9218.49 , p = 0.002 ) and neonatal hypoglycemia ( or : 53.72 , 95% ci : 6.78425.70 , p  <  0.001 ) .
