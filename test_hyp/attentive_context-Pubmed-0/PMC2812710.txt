the velocity sedimentation and translational diffusion coefficients of cd molecules were measured in water , dmf , and dmso . in dmf and dmso also the intrinsic viscosities could be measured .
it was possible to determine from the hydrodynamic data , by use of the sedfit program , relatively accurate values for cd molar mass and size , despite the fact that the sedimentation coefficients were as low as 0.10.5  s. the correspondence of the cd hydrodynamic values with the results calculated for toroids by use of a bead - shell model is demonstrated .
this comparison also shows that the outer cd dimensions are solvent - dependent and larger than those obtained from the crystallographic data .

velocity sedimentation , the translational diffusion , and viscosity as well as the increment of density were measured in three different solvents : water , dimethylformamide , and dimethylsulfoxide.table  1images of modeling structures , calculated molecular mass ( mcalc ) , inner ( dii ) and outer ( d0i ) diameters and the values of molecular mass obtained with maldi - tof ms of cyclodextrin moleculescdimages of modeling structuresmcalc ( g / mol)diia ( 10  cm)d0ia ( 10  cm)m ( maldi ) ( g / mol)-cd ( c6h10o5)6972.95.04.714.6972.4-cd ( c6h10o5)71,135.06.56.015.41,134.5-cd ( c6h10o5)81,297.18.37.517.51,296.6as measured on space - filling or cpk models ( saenger 1980 ; corey and pauling 1953 ) images of modeling structures , calculated molecular mass ( mcalc ) , inner ( dii ) and outer ( d0i ) diameters and the values of molecular mass obtained with maldi - tof ms of cyclodextrin molecules as measured on space - filling or cpk models ( saenger 1980 ; corey and pauling 1953 ) sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a beckman xli analytical ultracentrifuge at a rotor speed of 55,000  rpm and at 20c in al - double - sector cells of optical path 12  mm using interference optics .
