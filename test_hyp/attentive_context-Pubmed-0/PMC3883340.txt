this article discusses an icr managed by endodontic treatment , surgical management of resorptive defect by reverse sandwich technique and periodontal regeneration using platelet rich fibrin ( prf ) , prf membrane and bone graft .
significant bone fill was obtained in our case after a 2-year follow - up period ; thanks to the synergistic combination of prf and ha .
hydroxyapetite ( ha ) was added to prf in our study , this was because it has been demonstrated that the treatment of intrabony defects with prf results in significant improvements of pocket depth , clinical attachment level and bone fill compared with baseline and secondly , that ha increases the clinical effects observed with prf in the treatment periapical defects .
early diagnosis , elimination of the resorption and restorative management are the keys to a successful outcome .
treatment depends on the severity , location , whether the defect has perforated the root canal system and the restorability of the tooth . as smaller lesions offer the most favorable long - term outcome , endodontic treatment followed by surgical treatment
periodontal status of related tooth demonstrated mild mobility with normal probing depth , no gingival recession and no loss of clinical attachment [ figures 1f and 2d ] .
