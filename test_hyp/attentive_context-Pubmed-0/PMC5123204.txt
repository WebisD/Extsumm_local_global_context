adipose reduction of icer may be instrumental in the link between obesity and systemic insulin resistance . in the present study , we showed that the reduction of icer in adipocytes of both obese mice and obese human subjects is the consequence of impaired hdac5/hdac5 and hdac6/hdac6 expression . indeed , among the 11 hdacs expressed in adipose tissue , only these two enzymes were down regulated , which was sufficient to lead to an overall reduction of hdac activity and a reduction of icer expression .
hdac5 is required for hypothalamic leptin signaling and food intake , as hdac5 knockout mice display defective hypothalamic leptin signaling and are more prone to diet - induced obesity compared to wild - type mice . given the role of hdacs in obesity
the defect of the two hdacs in adipocytes by genetic silencing and selective inhibitors mimicked the effect of hypoxia and obesity on the expression of key adipokines and of icer , the key regulator of adipokine transcription .
we believe that our findings provide a significant hint for better understanding the mechanism responsible of adipose dysfunction , obesity related insulin resistance , and metabolic complications .
we speculate that the defective activity of the two hdacs in adipocytes leads to re - acetylation and thereby inhibition of some transcription factor(s ) required for the icer expression . in this case , increased icer expression may result from silencing the transcriptional repressor . this mechanism has been suggested for the positive regulation of icer by hdac activity in pc12 cells .
