this qualitative assessment has three objectives : ( a ) to identify whether , and in what areas , telemedicine was evaluated to achieve a favorable level of economic efficiency , that is , whether it was cost - saving or cost - effective in japan ; ( b ) to assess the methodological rigorousness of the economic evaluations ; and ( c ) to discuss future studies necessary to improve the general financial sustainability of telemedicine .
this study s aim was to conduct a systematic review to identify and analyze the published economic evaluations on telemedicine in japan .
in conclusion , compared to the substantial resources deployed for more than 1000 telemedicine trials in japan , very limited resources have been deployed for the economic evaluation of telemedicine trials .
the absence of a cohesive body of rigorous economic evaluation studies may be one of the key obstacles to the widespread adoption , proliferation , and funding of telemedicine programs [ 9,28 - 30 ] .
the inclusion criteria regarding economic evaluation were full economic evaluation   ( i.e. , cost - minimization analysis [ cma ] , cost - effectiveness analysis [ cea ] , cost - utility analysis [ cua ] , cost - benefit analysis [ cba ] ) , cost - only analysis , or benefit - only analysis .
