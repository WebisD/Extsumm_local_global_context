the purpose of the present study was to describe the clinical , laboratory , and medical history characteristics of all male hiv - infected patients diagnosed with foot fractures within a one - year period at a private practice rheumatology clinic in los angeles , and to differentiate these characteristics in tenofovir - treated versus non - tenofovir - treated patients .
when choosing antiretroviral agents for inclusion in haart regimens , it is important for clinicians to consider the potential for drugs to increase the risk of fracture , especially in hiv - infected patients in whom bone mineral density is already diminished .
fractures among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) have been the focus of an increasing number of studies since 2000.117 such fractures have been documented to occur more frequently than in people not infected by hiv6 and to involve longer healing times and an increased risk of infection.18 the large us prospective cohort hiv outpatient study ( n = 5826 ) reported that , in 2006 , the frequency of all fractures among hiv - infected patients aged 2554 years was over two - fold higher than in the us general outpatient population ( 84.2 versus 35.6 fractures per 10,000 people , adjusted for gender).6 hiv - infected patients have been shown to be at particularly high risk for developing fractures if they are aged 47 years ( compared with 35 years ) , have a history of cd4 cell count below 200/mm , have diabetes or hepatitis c coinfection , or are an intravenous drug user.6 because combination antiretroviral therapy has allowed more and more hiv - infected people to live well beyond 50 years , when osteoblastic activity significantly declines,1 the occurrence of fractures is expected to increase in this population in the future
