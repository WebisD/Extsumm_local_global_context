this review showed that the prevalence of asthma in korea ranges from 2 to 13% , and that physicians and patients often underestimate its severity .
the purpose of this review is to present an overview of the current disease status with respect to the prevalence , mortality rate , socioeconomic burden , quality of life and the treatment patterns of asthma in korea , to identify barriers to improvements in asthma care and to provide recommendations for action at the national , organizational and individual levels . for this ,
disease severity , level of control , and symptom state were all found to negatively impact the quality of life of asthmatics . moreover , although international and korean asthma management guidelines are available , primary care physicians are largely unfamiliar with or fail to implement them .
mortality from chronic lower respiratory diseases including asthma increased from 12.9 to 22.6 deaths per 100,000 of the population between 1992 and 2002 .
the total cost of the disease in the united states was estimated to be u$4.5 billion in the mid-1980s , whereas in the first half of the 1990s , this estimate had increased to between u$6.2 and u$10.7 billion ( 20 - 22 ) . in korea , where health insurance is mandatory and the cost of medical care is only covered in part by health insurance , the importance of economic outcomes also continues to grow although little data is currently available .
