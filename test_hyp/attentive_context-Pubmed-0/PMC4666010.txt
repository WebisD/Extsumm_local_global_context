these relationships remained significant even after adjusting for well - established cardiovascular risk factors , including age , bmi , sbp , dbp , fpg , tc , ldl - c , tg , hdl - c , and crp ( model 2 ) .
the association between fatty liver disease and presence of cac ( cacs > 0 ) was further explored by categorizing the severity of nafld into three groups and by using the first group as reference ( table 3 ) .
the prevalence of cac and the mean cac score significantly increased with the severity of fatty liver disease ( table 2 ) .
we found that the prevalence of cac was significantly associated with nafld after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors , but this association was attenuated after adjustment for insulin resistance . to the best of our knowledge ,
however , this association is attenuated after additional adjustment for insulin resistance ; thus , nafld is not an independent factor for coronary atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women .
this is the first study to investigate the correlation between nafld and presence of early coronary artery atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women . in this study ,
