it also provides important insights into the role of health - policy and medical interventions in reducing cardiovascular disease burden , such as differential access to health services and availability of drugs / medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels , and surgical treatments , well as of changing socioeconomic conditions and behavioral risk factors such as smoking , obesity , physical inactivity , and unhealthy diet.[6 - 8,10,11 ] the aim of our study is to examine changes in the extent of socioeconomic and racial disparities in cvd mortality in the us between 1969 and 2013 .
absolute socioeconomic disparities in cvd mortality for the total , male , and female populations , as measured by rate differences between the most and least deprived quintiles , also widened between 1982 and 2012 . us cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) mortality by area socioeconomic deprivation index , 1969 - 2011 cvd mortality rates decreased with decreasing deprivation levels for both white and black populations , with socioeconomic gradients in cvd mortality increasing consistently during 1969 - 2011 for both racial groups ( data not shown for brevity ) .
cvd is a more prominent cause of death than cancer for infants and at older ages 75 years and beyond , while cvd and cancer exert similar mortality risks between ages 20 and 74 years ( figure 1 ) . relative contribution of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) and cancer to overall mortality and age - specific patterns in cvd and cancer mortality , united states , 1969 - 2013 figure 2 presents annual cvd mortality trends from 1969 to 2013 for the total us population and by race / ethnicity and sex . during 1969 - 2013 ,
