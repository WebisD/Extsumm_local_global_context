exploratory laparotomy with a partial excision pseudocyst and placement of a catheter in a quadrant of abdomen is also an option .
ventriculo - peritoneal ( vp ) shunting is the preferred and most successful method for managing congenital hydrocephalus .
we report a 20-month - old female child with a vp shunt and a gradual distension of abdomen since three months , respiratory distress , and bilious vomiting for two days .
to summarize , laparoscopy is a useful modality for the treatment of intra - abdominal complications of vp shunt such as adhesions and pseudocyst .
it is feasible to manage this complication by using only the two - port laparoscopic technique .
, we found that minimally invasive technique is a useful modality for the treatment of this complication .
these pseudocysts have traditionally been treated with surgical shunt externalization , antibiotics , and a second surgical procedure for shunt reinsertion .
insertion of a vp shunt is the preferred and most successful method for the management of congenital hydrocephalus . in the setting of a vp shunt ,
it is effective , avoids multiple laparotomies , and its attendant complications and future adhesions .
an uncommon but recognized complication is formation of an abdominal pseudocyst , with cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) collecting and being poorly absorbed or not absorbed across the serosa .
