this is the first case of post - tee esophageal perforation treated endoscopically with this new clip device .
we report a case of esophageal perforation caused by tee during an aortic valve replacement operation , treated successfully with a new endoscopic clip . to the best of our knowledge ,
transesophageal echocardiogram ( tee ) has been introduced to the operating room over 30 years ago .
a 72-year - old female was admitted to the operating theater for aortic valve replacement . during the operation and in the first hours in the intensive care unit ( icu )
we clearly showed and strongly suggest that esophageal perforation of 5 days can safely and successfully be treated endoscopically by applying this new otsc clip device .
indeed , in another study with 94 patients regarding the use of the otsc clip to narrow the pouch in patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery , no esophageal perforation occurred . in conclusion
, although tee is a safe procedure , it may be complicated by esophageal perforation .
tee has safely been applied in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in icu departments for diagnostic purposes and monitoring over 30 years .
