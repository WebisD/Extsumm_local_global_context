epidemiologic investigation of an outbreak of s. typhimurium dt160 infection in new from may to august 2001 found that contact with dead wild birds , contact with other persons with gastrointestinal illness , and consumption of fast food were all significantly associated with illness .
the investigation successfully excluded a single common source exposure for this outbreak and instead suggested that multiple exposures contribute to s. typhimurium dt160 infections in new zealand .
in may 2001 , 24 cases of s. typhimurium dt160 salmonellosis were reported in the auckland region compared with an average of four sporadic cases each month with this serotype in the previous 7 months .
strategies for addressing these exposures include routine treatment of roof - collected rainwater , hygienic disposal of dead birds , and promotion of hand - hygiene protocols and sick foodhandler policies in fast - food outlets .
the source of this incursion of s. typhimurium dt160 into new zealand remains unknown : bird isolates have been exclusively from nonmigratory birds , s. typhimurium dt160 has not been identified in neighboring countries in the pacific basin , and early case - patients did not have a history of overseas travel .
a case - control study and environmental investigation were undertaken to identify the vehicle of infection and source of the outbreak .
