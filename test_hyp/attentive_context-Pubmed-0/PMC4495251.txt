however , 1530% of cases of dm are manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes of an underlying malignancy . here , we present a case of concurrent dm and breast cancer to highlight a rare presentation , progression and regression of symptoms , as well as key components of diagnosis and treatment .
dermatomyositis ( dm ) is an uncommon idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that primarily affects skeletal muscle and skin with well - characterized cutaneous findings .
it has been well documented that dm carries an increased risk of malignancy and can present as a paraneoplastic syndrome to multiple types of underlying malignancies   .
the patient is a 47-year - old polish premenopausal female who presented with complaints of a non - tender palpable left breast mass for 4 months at an outside institution .
early diagnosis of dm as a paraneoplastic syndrome allows for initiation of systemic therapy for symptom control and also treatment of the underlying malignancy itself , which may aid in control of the dm symptoms .
given the high frequency of malignancy in patients with a diagnosis of dm , any woman over the age of 45 with newly diagnosed dm should prompt a thorough physical examination , including a breast examination , as well as further workup for other malignancies ( e.g. ovarian or colorectal cancer ) .
