our objective is to review the effects of influenza vaccination in preventing influenza - related outcomes in pregnant women and their infants .
maternal immunization for influenza significantly reduced the incidence of influenza - like illness in women and infants . for clinical practice ,
the influenza vaccine was found to reduce the risk of influenza - like illness in mothers and infants as well as the risk of laboratory - confirmed influenza in infants .
mothers who received the influenza vaccine had a lower incidence of influenza - like illness , as did their infants ( high - quality evidence ) , but there was no difference found for influenza - like illness with fever higher than 38c ( moderate - quality evidence )
some studies adjusted their results for confounding factors , such as the women 's age , week of delivery , infant 's gender , and gestational age .
with regard to medical visits for influenza - like illness in infants , the observational studies showed no significant differences   , and the rct showed a reduction in such rate   ( moderate - quality evidence ) .
two studies found no difference in the incidence of hospitalization for influenza - like illness in infants   ; in one study , the reduction in the rate of hospital admission was significant .
