the objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and complication associated with transurethral removal ( tur ) of the intravesical or intraurethral mesh following midurethral sling procedures .
the median period between the midurethral sling and mesh removal was 31.3 months ( range , 2.2 to 247.6 months ) , and the median follow - up period was 2.1 months ( range , 0.3 to 35.9 months ) after mesh removal .
a retrospective chart review was performed for women who had undergone transurethral surgery for bladder or urethral mesh between january 2002 and december 2010 .
overall , 6 women ( 26% ) had a mesh remnant after transurethral surgery : 1 woman ( 6.2% ) after tur - e and 5 women ( 71.4% ) after tur - h .
transurethral resection has good functional outcomes and a low risk of recurrence of stress incontinence .
the surgical outcomes and complications were evaluated . to remove the mesh , transurethral resection with an electrode loop ( tur - e )
sixteen women had the tur - e procedure and 7 women had the tur - h procedure . at the time of surgery , the median age was 51 years ( range , 40 to 67 years ) .
