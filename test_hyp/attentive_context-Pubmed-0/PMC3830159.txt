a total of 226 bengali medium students ( male 99 and female 127 ) , studying in class seven and eight , were taken from two urban and two rural schools of west bengal .
item rest of test correlations alpha reliability found for the four subscales were 0.620 for extraversion , 0.663 for neuroticism , 0.604 for psychoticism , and 0.620 for lie scale . the test 
the present study was aimed to examine to what extent the bengali translation of the jepqr - s is functional in bengali cultured population . the results [ table 1 ] of the first stage of data analysis indicate that most of the items within a subscale have significant correlations with rest of the items .
table 1 presents that the item rest of test correlations vary for the extraversion between 0.082 and 0.417 , for neuroticism between 0.127 and 0.552 , for psychoticism between 0.085 and 0.504 , and for the lie scale between 0.051 and 0.363 .
the alpha coefficients of all the four subscales recorded in this study do not cross 0.7 , the level recommended by kline , but they are very close to it and satisfactory .
