the aims of this study are to examine the prevalence of nasal mrsa colonization in patients undergoing otologic surgeries and to determine the association between mrsa colonization and the pathogens identified from perioperative culture studies .
the rate of nasal mrsa colonization among patients with csom was higher than among the general community .
the study included 66 consecutive patients ( 25 males and 41 females ) undergoing tympanomastoid surgeries from may 2010 to december 2011 at the yonsei university college of medicine gangnam severance hospital .
it has been emphasized that selection of appropriate antibiotics should be based on the bacteriologic studies to identify the pathogens and determine sensitivities.2,3 ) recent bacteriologic studies of the middle ear discharge in csom in korea have reported increasing prevalence of methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa).2,4,5 ) in addition , staphylococcus aureus ( s. aureus ) and pseudomonas species were most predominant from the postoperative otorrhea cultures.3 ) higher rates of postoperative otorrhea and reperforation after tympanomastoid surgeries were reported in csom patients with mrsa cultured from preoperative ear discharge.6 ) in addition to intrinsic mrsa infection of the mastoid air cell system , nasal colonization of mrsa may pose increased risk of postoperative infection . nasal colonization rate of mrsa and it is a known predictor of postoperative surgical site infection.7,8 ) previous studies have identified bacterial pathogens from the middle ear and the mastoid air cells , or nasopharynx as a bacterial reservoir in csom.4,5,9 - 12 ) however , few studies have focused on the effect of nasal mrsa colonization in the otologic surgery .
