the yields reported in the supporting information describe the result of a single experiment , whereas the yields reported 
 in scheme 2 and table 1 are average yields of two or more experiments .
high resolution esi mass 
 spectra were acquired using an instrument equipped with at tof mass 
 analyzer , and high resolution ei mass spectra were acquired using 
 an instrument equipped with a magnetic sector mass analyzer .
thus , the yields 
 reported in the supporting information may 
 differ from those shown in scheme 2 and table 1 .
structural and stereochemical assignments were made on the basis of 
 2-d cosy , hsqc , and noesy experiments . ratios of diastereomers were 
 determined by h nmr analysis .
all reactions were carried out 
 under a nitrogen atmosphere in oven- or flame - dried glassware . all 
 catalysts and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were 
 used without further purification with the exception of bf3oet2 , which was purified by distillation from cah2 .
yields 
 refer to isolated yields of compounds estimated to be 95% 
 pure as determined by h nmr analysis unless otherwise 
 noted .
2:1:1 mixture 
 of the two possible diastereomers and a side product tentatively assigned 
 as 6-methyl-11-methylene-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[b , f]azocine , which results from competing intramolecular 
 heck reaction .
