more recently , tandem - mass - spectrometry ( ms - ms ) , with its ability to measure a wide range of metabolites simultaneously , has opened up a further range of disorders , many of which are very rare but can be incorporated with screening for phenylketonuria at little additional cost .
there was little consensus regarding information provision , informed consent , storage and disposal of residual specimens , screening technologies and disease definition .
the scope of newborn screening has expanded greatly in the 52 years since robert guthrie published his microbial assay for phenylalanine and the use of dried blood spots in screening for phenylketonuria .
european countries with equally well - developed medical systems have very different screening policies : in 2009 , the maximum number of conditions covered was 30 and some countries were screening for four or less ( 2 ) .
immunoassay - based screens for other disorders followed , cystic fibrosis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia in particular , but none have achieved general acceptance .
thus , in large parts of the usa screening covers over 50 conditions ( 1 ) though this total is inflated counting sickle - associated haemoglobin variants as separate diseases .
