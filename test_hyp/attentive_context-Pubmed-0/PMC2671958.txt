based on the information we have reviewed it seems that d - mph is a useful agent in the treatment of adhd .
the literature reviewed identified that there are meaningful differences in the clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile between the d- and l - isomers of mph .
furthermore , it should be noted it is the only mph product approved for the treatment of this disorder in adults .
attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) affects a large number of children . in the united states , rates range from 5% to 6% of school - age children ( guevara et al 2002 ; lesesne et al 2003).the illness is characterized by a triad of symptom clusters which include inattention , hyperactivity , and impulsivity . usually the illness is first detected during the early school years ( goldman et al 1998 ) , but can persist during adolescence and even adulthood .
further study is required to more fully understand the side - effect differences between the d - isomer and its racemic counterpart .
when comparing the single isomer with the racemic compound , a consistently noted difference across studies is that d - mph has a longer duration of action than d , l - mph .
