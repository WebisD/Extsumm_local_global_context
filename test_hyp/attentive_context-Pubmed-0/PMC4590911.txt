the purpose of this study was to investigate intrarater and interrater reliability of the tja with raters of different educational backgrounds and levels of clinical experience with healthy injury - free men and women .
the purpose of this study was to investigate intrarater and interrater reliability of the tja with raters of different educational backgrounds and levels of clinical experience with healthy injury - free men and women .
using a published protocol and training of raters , the tja has poor to moderate interrater and intrarater reliability
interrater reliability between the 5 raters was poor ( icc = 0.47 ; 95% ci : 0.330.62 ) . however , interrater reliability between raters 1 , 2 , and 5 ( raters used for intrarater reliability ) improved in the second scoring session ( icc = 0.52 , 95% ci : 0.350.68 versus icc = 0.69 , 95% ci : 0.550.81 ) .
the videos of 40 participants ( n = 13 men and n = 27 women ) were randomly selected for this reliability study .
intrarater reliability testing was completed by raters 1 , 2 , and 5 who scored the tja videos at two different timepoints .
