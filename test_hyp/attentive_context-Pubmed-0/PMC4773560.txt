, the in vitro steroidogenesis assay of nci - h295r cells can assess the human adrenal toxicity of a novel pharmaceutical drug based on quantitative understanding of its toxicological mechanism in adrenal steroidogenesis .
furthermore , the mechanisms of action of steroidogenesis disrupting compounds for steroidogenic enzymes can be estimated by the optimization method to solve the reverse problem from the concentration changes of 12 steroid hormones measured by liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry in the steroidogenesis assay of nci - h295r cells in vitro . using this developed model of adrenal steroidogenesis and the analytical approach
moreover , to quantitatively estimate mechanisms of action of adrenal toxic compounds , we analyzed differential metabolic profiles of 12 steroid hormones at 3 days after exposure to 11 adrenal toxic compounds , by using the new mathematical model and a hybrid optimization method of the rcga and a local search ( nonlinear least squares ) .
the novel mathematical model of adrenal steroidogenesis was constructed in this study , including cholesterol transport and distribution , the c21-steroid hormone pathway , steroid transport , and cell proliferation , which could reproduce adrenal steroidogenesis in nci - h295r cells . according to the results of dynamic sensitivity analysis using the new model
