a 71-year - old male presented with pulsatile swelling over the right side of face and over the forehead in october 2009 .
patient was evaluated with computed tomography ( ct ) angiogram , which showed aneurysm of the external carotid artery with thrombus within and multiple aneurysm of the branches of external carotid arteries .
he is assessed with clinical examination on each visit and ultrasound examination performed once in a year to assess the size of the aneurysm .
treatment option of excising the aneurysm with ligation of external carotid aneurismal branches was discussed with the patient . since the swelling was asymptomatic for the past 34 years , patient was not willing for any procedure .
these lesions though may cause life threatening hemorrhage , watchful observation is still considered as a treatment option in these patients .
primary care physicians have a major role in follow up of these patients and decide upon referring these patients to specialized vascular center thus lessen the burden of vascular centre in following these patients .
patient is a known diabetic and hypertensive for the past 9 years on regular medications .
multiple aneurysm of external carotid artery this case was discussed for the rarity of idiopathic multiple aneurysm [ figure 3 ] of the external carotid artery [ figure 4 ] and the need for individualized treatment protocol to be followed , as in this case , only watchful observation . in this world of evolving surgical techniques and newer treatment modalities , conservative treatment still has a role to play .
