the aim of the present work was to study the expression of cd39 and cd73 in endometrioid ( type i ) and serous ( type ii ) ec when compared with nontumoral endometrium . to achieve this objective , protein and gene expression experiments , as well as in situ enzyme activity assays ,
the consequences of this high cd39 activity in endometrial tumors are increased levels of amp , the substrate for cd73 , and also highly expressed in these tumors , which will , in turn , generate increased immunosuppressive levels of extracellular adenosine .
this also coincides with the higher grade of these tumors , but further studies are needed to establish statistical correlations with the tumor grade in the case of type i endometrioid tumors .
we show and discuss our results on the expression of the ecto - nucleotidases cd39 and cd73 in type i and type ii endometrial carcinomas .
this technique has also been previously used to demonstrate by immunolabeling a decreased expression of p2x7 atp receptor in endometrial cancer cells   and also , recently , the relationship between p53 expression and the tumor grade . however , to our knowledge , this is the first report validating the use of touch preps for enzyme activity studies , therefore opening the possibility of performing such studies in cytological samples . in order to determine
