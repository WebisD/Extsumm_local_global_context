is used to fabricate a three - dimensional model to assess the available bone for implant placement in the mandible .
the surgical guide is essential to establish a logical continuity among diagnosis , prosthetic planning , and surgical phase .
, neither buccolingual width nor angulation can be properly visualized on the most traditional radiographs . in the following case report , an innovative simplified method without radiation
even a minor variation in comparison to ideal placement causes difficulties in fabrication of final prostheses .
a patient of age 27 years reported to the department of prosthodontics for the replacement of missing left first molar .
. this surgical template can dictate the implant body placement that offers the best combination of support for the repetitive forces of occlusion and esthetics .
on the three - dimensional model , the surgical guide was fabricated [ figure 8 ]
following steps were performed to achieve a three - dimensional model : 
 intraoral impression was recorded with addition silicone putty and light body [ figure 1]fabrication of acrylic assembly for aligning both intraoral and extraoral impressiona rectangular block of acrylic was made to which impression tray was pressed to make indentations . after applying separating medium
