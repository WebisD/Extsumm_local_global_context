in a recent issue of the new england journal of medicine , greet van den berghe and co - workers   published a confirmation of the life - saving effects of tight glycaemia control by intensive insulin therapy ( iit ) in medical intensive care unit ( icu ) patients .
greet van den berghe and colleagues wanted to confirm the life - saving effects of iit in medical icu patients in order to answer specific criticisms related to the type of patients , mostly surgical with two - thirds being post - cardiac surgery patients , in the first leuven study .
this second study intended to answer some of the questions and criticisms raised by the landmark leuven study of 2001 , which reported a 4% decrease in mortality in a surgical icu population [ 2 - 7 ] .
the use of iit in leuven is probably easier than in other institutions with a lower nurse - to - patient ratio . for an iit approach ,
hopefully , these questions will be answered by the multi - centre assessments of the effects of iit , the nice - sugar and glucontrol trials , currently underway in australia and europe , respectively . before the completion of these two indispensable studies ,
