the success of valproic acid ( vpa , 2-propylpentanoic acid ) , a short branched chain fatty acid , for the therapy of absence seizures , partial seizures , tonic - clonic seizures , bipolar disorder , schizoaffective disorder , social phobias , neuropathic pain and for the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headaches has spurred investigation for its use in the treatment of other conditions .
in contrast , later on in the patient 's clinical course her raised venous ammonia levels were found to be slowly down - trending in the presence of sub - therapeutic serum vpa .
treatments for encephalopathy secondary to hyperammonemia as a side - effect of vpa treatment remain empirical and restoration of possible hepatic carnitine deficiency remains controversial .
this case report suggests that hyperammonemia , which is known to occur in about 50% patients treated with vpa , may have more than one concurrent etiologic mechanism with different decay kinetics which are not related to hepatic damage or carnitine deficiency .
recognition of symptoms of hyperammonemia remains a challenge especially in psychiatric patients . in a review of 11 case reports of symptomatic hyperammonemia in a psychiatric setting it was noted that acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy in psychiatric patients may present in various ways , sometimes with subtle clinical features .
