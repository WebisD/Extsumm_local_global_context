we present a case of an intramuscular osteolipoma on the posterior neck , independent of vertebrae , and review the clinicopathologic features of osteolipoma previously published in the literature .
a 51-year - old female presented with a 5-year history of a painless , progressively enlarging mass on the posterior neck .
only two cases of osteolipoma arising in connection with vertebrae have been described . here ,
lipoma is a common benign soft tissue neoplasm that sometimes may have mixed tissue components .
ossification of a lipoma was first described in 1959 , and it is rarely reported7,16 ) .
we suggest that although osteolipoma is a rare variant , it is important to keep it in mind when a soft tissue mass of the posterior neck mixed with osseous component is encountered .
to the best of our knowledge , it is the first case report of an intramuscular osteolipoma within the posterior neck independent of adjacent bone .
several names have been used to describe ossification of lipomas , including secondary calcification , ossified lipoma , ossifying lipoma , or osteolipoma , and some authors have used these terms interchangeably . as with classic lipomas , lipomas with ossifications may be found in any part of the body , but are usually found in the head , neck , oral cavity , and extremities , adjacent to bone .
