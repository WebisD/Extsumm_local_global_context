the aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy and the drug interactions between curcucmin / piperine / chloroquine and curcumin / piperine / artemisinin in plasmodium chabaudi parasites resistant to chloroquine ( as-3cq ) and artemisinin ( as - art ) and to verify the effects of curcumin , chloroquine , and artemisinin drug treatment on the ups .
it is already known that drug treatment can interfere with ion homeostasis , which would result in alterations in the intracellular ph of several organelles that are crucial for parasite survival , thereby interfering with enzyme activity and function , which would explain the necessity of an increase in the transcription and translation of pcuch - l3 , pcuch - l5 , and pcubp-8 gene products to compensate for enzyme damage .
the results show that the interaction between curcumin / piperine / chloroquine was additive and helped in the reduction of the parasite load 7 days after treatment had ended .
on the other hand , treatment of human breast carcinoma mcf-7 cells with doxorubicin , which also has antimalarial activity , showed an 18.6-fold increase in the 26s proteosome regulatory subunit   indicating that alterations in the ups may represent a general adaptation of the parasite to drug treatment .
