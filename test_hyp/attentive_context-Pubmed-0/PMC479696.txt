the primary objectives of the investigation were to determine : ( 1 ) whether a high intensity , whole body resistance exercise test ( ret ) caused lipid peroxidation measures to significantly increase , ( 2 ) the effects of a 2 week period of antioxidant vitamin supplementation ( vitamin e ) on the levels of lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret , and ( 3 ) the impact that the training state ( untrained vs trained ) had on possible lipid peroxidation measures caused by the ret .
the 27 participants had a two week period of vitamin e supplementation ( 885 mg tocopherol / day  su ) and a two week period of placebo ( soy bean oil capsule
the end result of the study showed that the two weeks of vitamin e supplementation ( 885 mg / day  tocopherol acetate ) did not attenuate resistance exercise induced lipid peroxidation in both untrained or trained resistance participants . if the assumption is correct that acute measures of increased levels of lipid peroxidation contribute to long term negative health consequences , then the implications of this research would indicate that vitamin e antioxidant supplementation does not combat the negative health consequences . also , the trained participant had no added protection against free radical damage if exposed to the same relative intensity of exercise .
