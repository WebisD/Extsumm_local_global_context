therefore , this study evaluated changes in the physicopsychological functions of elderly 
 women with a fear of falling in negotiating obstacles such as a doorstep ( 5.2  cm ) of a 
 bathroom , where falling occurs frequently , through a performance - oriented mobility 
 assessment ( poma ) in order to understand whether cse is valid as an efficient exercise to 
 prevent and control falling in consideration of the physicopsychological functions of 
 elderly women .
eg , experimental group ; cg , control group ; poma , performance - oriented 
 mobility assessment ; cv , crossing velocity ; mvhc , maximum vertical heel clearance ; kf , 
 knee flexion .
it is suggested that the 6-week cse 
 decreased excessive obstacle gait with physical instability in elderly women and improved 
 their physicopsychological functions involving obstacle gait .

repeated measure anova to analyze changes in the poma , cv , mvhc , kf , depression , and fof 
 according to the measurement periods showed that there was a statistically significant 
 difference in the interaction between time and the groups and that the changes in poma , cv , 
 mvhc , kf , depression , and fof according to time differed ( p<0.001 ) ( table 1table 1.changes in physical and psychological function variablesgroupbeforeafterpoma ( score)eg ( n=10)17.601.3419.301.57**cg ( n=10)17.801.4017.601.43cv ( m / sec)eg ( n=10)1.560.211.600.21*cg ( n=10)1.560.101.550.09mvhc ( cm)eg ( n=10)7.421.387.021.33*cg ( n=10)7.361.627.311.74kf ( angle)eg ( n=10)111.003.16108.604.06*cg ( n=10)110.803.77110.303.16depression ( score)eg ( n=10)27.103.6724.503.34**cg ( n=10)26.002.5825.203.00fear of falling ( score)eg ( n=10)22.501.4319.801.69*cg ( n=10)22.603.2721.903.54meansd .
