however , the 40%-sfsg is prone to ischemia / reperfusion injury and shear stress with portal hypertension , and therefore , the os - induced damage after solt is more fatal   . in our study ,
, we investigated the strategic potential of graft pretreatment in vivo by a gabar agonist in the rat solt model with a 40%-sfsg , and we examined the possible pathways involved .
the effects of gabar regulation on graft damage after solt with a 40%-sfsg appear to prevent os by reducing dna damage via the atm / h2ax pathway and by promoting cell survival via the pi3k / akt pathway .
even though ciwr injury and shear stress with portal hypertension affect 40%-sfsgs after solt and results in fatal os , graft pretreatment in vivo by gabar regulation clearly improves graft damage after solt .
os causes dna damage and subsequent apoptosis   , and in our study , immunohistochemistry showed that solt induced apoptosis in the 40%-sfsg .
our study showed a decrease in sod 1 and sod 2 levels after solt with a 40%-sfsg , although we initially expected that antioxidant enzymes would increase .
our study showed that the regulation of hepatic gabar also appeared to reduce os - induced dna damage via the atm / h2ax pathway as well as to have effects in the brain . with regard to the effects of gabar regulation on os in the brain
