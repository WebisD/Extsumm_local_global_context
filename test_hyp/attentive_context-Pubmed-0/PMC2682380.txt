thus , this paper discusses , based on a review of the literature , the efficacy of alendronate against hip fractures and the mechanism for this anti - fracture efficacy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis .
evidence derived from the literature , stratified and based on strict ebm guidelines , suggests the efficacy of alendronate against hip fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis with an overall risk reduction rate of 55% . according to the analyses of the fracture intervention trial , each 1 standard deviation reduction in a 1-year change in bsap
thus , the efficacy of alendronate against hip fractures has been confirmed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis , especially with once - weekly dosing regimen .
alendronate is effective in reducing the risk of hip fractures across a spectrum of ages .
in particular , evidence to explain the efficacy of alendronate against hip fractures has been accumulated for postmenopausal osteoporosis .
the mechanism for this anti - fracture efficacy has been clarified ; alendronate suppresses bone turnover and subsequently increases hip bmd , decreases cortical porosity , improves parameters of hip structure geometry ( cortical thickness , cross - sectional area , section modulus , and buckling ratio ) , and produces more uniform mineralization ( increases the mdmb ) in cortical bone .
