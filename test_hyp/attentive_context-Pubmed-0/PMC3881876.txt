both egcg and chx retain their antibacterial activity when incorporated into the resin matrix . although less effective at the sub - mic level , egcg in r1 and r2 resins significantly reduced cell survival of the cariogenic organism s. mutans , suggesting a novel alternative to synthetic chemicals .
the results demonstrated that both chx and egcg drugs retained their antimicrobial activity when integrated as part of r1 and r2 restorative materials . in each resin tested , there was no significant difference in bacterial growth inhibition between the treatment groups ( chx 0.5x mic , chx 1x mic , and egcg 1x mic ) , with the exception of egcg at 0.5x mic that had significantly higher survival values ( p<0.05 ) .
the aim of this study was to test the antimicrobial activity of egcg when compared to chx , against the cariogenic organism s. mutans after being released by experimental dental copolymers .
the evident antibacterial activity of egcg suggest novel approaches in the development of dental restorative materials to help control dental caries , the most common infectious disease affecting humans .
the 24 h drug release rates for r1 are : chx ( 0.5x mic=1.28 g / cm and 1x mic=2.31 g / cm and egcg ( 0.5x mic=6.37 g / cm and 1x mic=13.05 g / cm ; and for r2 are : chx ( 0.5x mic=0.34 g / cm and 1x mic=0.82 g / cm and egcg ( 0.5x mic=1.69 g / cm and 1x mic=3.64 g / cm . the cell viability for drug - containing bis - gma / tegdma ( r1 ) and bis - gma / ch3bis - gma ( r2 )
