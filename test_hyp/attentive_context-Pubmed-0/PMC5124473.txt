unfortunately , this is an age at which particular diseases will arise and may need surgeries , such as appendicitis , osteosarcoma , and leukemia . in the present study , we investigated whether the spatial reference memory of 2-month - old mice will be affected after anesthesia and surgery .
we demonstrated in the present study that ( a ) anesthesia and surgery but not anesthesia only temporally increased hippocampal il-1 and il-6 , as well as microglia activation in the hippocampus in 2-month - old young adult mice and that ( b ) anesthesia and surgery can not hurt the short - term and long - term reference memory of such aged mice .
surgery profoundly induced microglia activation in the hippocampus , which was intensive at 6 and 24 hours after surgery but started to decline by 48 hours ( figure 3 ) .
accordingly , 36-month - old mice and 2-month - old mice are biologically equivalent to 3040-year - old human and college freshmen , respectively . while maze 's group investigated the learning and memory after anesthesia and surgery in 3 - 4-month - old mice , no data in younger adult mice , that is , 2-month - old , are available .
