the aim of our study was to determine the ovarian reserve in young women after anticancer treatment during childhood and adolescence , using the protocols with different degrees of gonadotoxicity .
they had been treated for hodgkin lymphoma , hl ( n = 22 ) , wilms tumor ( n = 11 ) , soft tissue sarcoma , sts ( n = 7 ) , neuroblastoma ( n = 2 ) germinal tumors ( n = 7 ) , acute myeloblastic leukemia ( n = 4 ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( n = 22 ) chronic myeloblastic leukemia ( n = 2 ) , and non - hodgkin lymphoma ( n = 6 ) .
our results show the utility of amh measurement as an early , sensitive marker of a reduced ovarian reserve in young cancer survivors .
the hr group was analyzed separately : patients diagnosed with hl irradiated and nonirradiated for the infradiaphragmatic region , patients treated for solid tumors with radiation to the infradiaphragmatic area , and patients after bone marrow transplantation . in these subgroups , amh values were lower than those in the control group , being the lowest in patients after bone marrow transplantation ( 3.37  2.32  pmol / ml ) .
