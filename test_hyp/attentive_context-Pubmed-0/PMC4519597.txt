we present the cases of two patients who were initially misdiagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita ( eba ) predominantly based on histopathology but were subsequently diagnosed with pct on porphyrin studies due to clinical suspicion .
porphyria cutanea tarda ( pct ) is the most common type of porphyria worldwide , affecting sun - exposed areas of the skin , manifested by cutaneous fragility , vesicobullae , atrophic scarring and formation of milia .
there are inherited , acquired and toxic forms of the condition and diagnosis is confirmed based on skin symptoms and porphyrin analysis of urine , blood and stool . without clinical suspicion for this important diagnosis the necessary investigations may not be performed , resulting in a delay of diagnosis and treatment .
this condition is a disorder of heme biosynthesis caused by a catalytic deficiency in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase .
a 36-year - old female presented with a 6-month history of blisters on the dorsal aspects of her hands bilaterally with associated fragility and photosensitivity .
our cases demonstrate the possible difficulty in differentiating pct from eba and the potentially significant consequences of this misdiagnosis . in patients with undifferentiated bullous / erosive skin conditions occurring in photo - distributed regions ,
