, we will briefly summarize the mechanisms of autophagy in general and particularly plant autophagy , list commonly used techniques to detect and quantify autophagy , and finally discuss their utility in plant autophagy detection .
, autophagy can function as a nonapoptotic and alternative programmed cell death mechanism , and its role in plant cell death was explored   . as a consequence of its involvement in several important physiological and pathological phenomena , autophagy became one of the fastest expanding fields of molecular biology in recent years . in this review
the readers may find an in - depth discussion of the mechanistic aspects of autophagy in recently published reviews   .
autophagy , literally meaning self ( auto ) eating ( phagy ) , is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated catabolic process that leads to the degradation of cellular components using lysosomal / vacuolar degradation machinery of the same cell .
accumulation of the knowledge on autophagy molecular mechanisms stimulated the discovery of more efficient and reliable molecular tools to study autophagy . despite the fact that some of these methods and tools seem to be more suitable for use in specific model organisms
due to its role in fundamental biological phenomena in various organisms including humans and plants , interest in autophagy field is growing exponentially .
