we group the 
 known spirotetronates based on common structural elements and biosynthetic 
 considerations .
, they represent highly promising leads in drug discovery . 
 to appreciate their untapped potential , in this review
the discovery of penicillin 
 revolutionized pharmaceutical research 
 by demonstrating , for the first time , that microorganisms can produce 
 secondary metabolites of value to medicine .
the 
 search for new antitumor antibiotics led to the discovery of 
 chlorothricin ( 1 ) , a complex polyketide produced by various streptomyces strains .
spirotetronate 
 polyketides exhibit potent antibacterial and antitumor activities 
 and a documented value as tools in the elucidation of new biological 
 pathways . as such
one of the most notable examples of an antitumor 
 antibiotic is mitomycin c , a microbial metabolite that is used currently 
 for the treatment of breast and bladder cancer . among other antitumor antibiotics , daunorubicin and its 
 semisynthetic derivative doxorubicin represent chemotherapeutic leukemia 
 agents in clinical settings .
impressive synthetic and chemical biology efforts 
 were combined to decipher the mode - of - action of abyssomicins at the 
 molecular level .
this 
 family is identified by the presence of a cyclohexene ring spiro - linked 
 to a tetronic acid moiety ( figure 1 , fragment 
 a ) that is embedded in a macrocycle ( figure 1 , fragment b ) . in several cases , the structure also contains a trans - decalin ring ( figure 1 , fragment 
 c ) and is decorated by various deoxy oligosaccharides ( figure 1 , fragment d ) . in terms of biological profile ,
