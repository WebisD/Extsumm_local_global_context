, this study was carried out to ascertain the prevalence of rotavirus , adenovirus , and norovirus infection in young children with diarrhea in two primary health centers in edo state , nigeria .
it also aimed at assessing the coinfection rates of the viral agents , age , seasonal distribution of infection , and the association between clinical symptoms and viral diarrhea .
coinfection of viral agents was found to be 7.6% and the most common clinical symptom was vomiting .
a total of 223 children with diarrhea were tested for three viral agents ( rotavirus , adenovirus , and norovirus ) .
thus , there is need to test stool specimens of clinically confirmed diarrheal patients for enteric viruses as this will go a long way in reducing the wasteful use of antibiotics which are used as blind treatment for persistent diarrhea that may be of viral origin .
the sex distribution of enteric viruses showed that males had 54 ( 44.6% ) positive cases while females had 41 ( 40.2% ) , and this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.60 ) .
the seasonal pattern of enteric viruses showed that rainy season had 60 ( 46.9% ) while dry season had 35 ( 36.8% ) , and this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.17 ) .
