we decided to undertake a study on the feasibility of spirometry screening for copd in primary care in france .
pneumologist concordance for the possibility to interpret the spirometry curve was moderate ( =0.40 ) and good for ao diagnosis ( =0.62 )
the time factor was often raised as limiting the implementation of new techniques or strategies in general medicine , where the estimated mean consultation duration is 15 minutes.18 thus , after two education sessions dedicated to spirometry in the framework of copd screening , we examined spirometry duration .
pneumologist concordance  was 0.40 for the possibility to interpret the spirometry curve and 0.62 for ao diagnosis .
the gps were asked to come to a second session with five test results to pursue their training . before and after the sessions , a 12-question questionnaire evaluating each participant s knowledge of spirometry , its acceptability and reproducibility criteria , and the diagnostic criterion of ao was completed and graded on 100 points . moreover , after the inclusion of the first five patients , a pneumologist instructor s evaluation of the quality of the first five spirometry curves was sent to each participating gp . from october 2013 to may 2014 , each gp aimed to recruit 20 consecutive patients at risk of developing copd .
