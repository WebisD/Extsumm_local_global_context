our results indicate the close correlation between p15 gene mutation and growth of osteosarcoma , and the potentially direct involvement of p15 gene in pulmonary metastasis .
in a total of 25 peripheral blood samples in osteosarcoma rats , 18 of them ( 72% ) showed mutation in the 2 exon of p15 gene , while control rats had normal gene isoforms ( table 3 , figure 2 ) . in examining rats from different time points
a total of 60 sd rats ( both males and females , ages 4~5 weeks , body weight 150~170 g ) from the laboratory animal center of harbin medical university , were randomly divided into control and model groups ( n=30 each ) .
on the first week , most of osteosarcoma and pulmonary tissues showed negative staining for tumor cells . from week 2 , positive staining cells began to occur in model rats but not in control rats . on week 6 , the tumor positive rates were as high as 85% and 72% in primary and pulmonary tissues , respectively ( table 2 , figure 1 ) .
our results suggest the potency of p15 mutant genes as a novel biological marker in early diagnosis of osteosarcoma in clinics , although its detailed molecular mechanism in progression and pulmonary metastasis require further study . molecular biology research is still required to elucidate the mechanism of mutation location of p15 gene , as well as its role in the metastasis of osteosarcoma to the lung .
