the aim of this paper is to give an overview of the published literature on the effects of edcs on leydig cell function and steroidogenesis with particular focus on male reproduction and fertility .
reliable data on the prevalence of tds are scarse but > 5% of the danish male population was reported to suffer from undescended testes , hypospadia , or testicular cancer . moreover , the recent finding of an age - independent decrease in testosterone and sex hormone - binding globulin ( shbg ) levels in us and danish populations over the past 20 years indicate an environmental influence such as a growing negative effect of edcs on androgen production by leydig cells . in addition , recent findings have demonstrated the association between exposures to edcs and the development of obesity , a factor that may cause increased estrogenic effects on the humans and attenuate leydig cell function and fertility .
disruption of androgen biosynthesis and actions by environmental endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ) , of synthetic or natural origin chemicals ( table 1 ) , inhibiting critical cellular processes controlling steroidogenesis in leydig cells ( e.g. , transport and delivery of cholesterol into mitochondria , steroidogenic enzyme expression or activity ) and androgen binding to the androgens receptor ( ar ) may lead to incomplete masculinization and malformations in the male reproductive tract of both humans and animals .
