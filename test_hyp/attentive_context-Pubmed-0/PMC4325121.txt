currently , several studies have reported on the high success rate of redo pyeloplasty . however , to our knowledge , the factors affecting functional outcomes after redo pyeloplasty have not yet been reported . accordingly , the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate changes in differential renal function ( drf ) , as a functional outcome , in children who underwent redo pyeloplasty for the management of failed pyeloplasty and to outline the factors associated therewith .
if left untreated , ureteropelvic junction obstruction ( upjo ) can lead to hydronephrosis and progressive impairment of renal function . with success rates exceeding 98% ,
, another study reported that anderson - hynes pyeloplasty had no effect on renal function after surgery and that the increase in renal function at follow - up in infants might be attributable to their normal growth potential . in light of our results
therefore , in the present study , we set out to evaluate changes in drf and rct by use of serial renal scintigraphy and ultrasound .
in the decrease in drf group , drf was significantly decreased between before and after initial pyeloplasty ( p=0.028 ) ; in the no decrease in drf group , the difference was not significant ( p=0.397 ) .
