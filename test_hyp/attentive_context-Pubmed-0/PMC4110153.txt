isolated scnsl is a rare disease in which standardized treatment guidelines have yet to be developed .
this case is one particular example where a patient designated as low risk for developing scnsl did progress to an isolated occurrence of the disease .
administration of intrathecal chemotherapy is generally reserved for patients with leptomeningeal disease and positivity on cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) testing , although large retrospective series have been equivocal on this topic.22

central nervous system ( cns ) lymphoma can present as either secondary , representing 1 to 7% of lymphomas , or primary , representing 0.2 to 2% of lymphomas.1 secondary cns lymphoma ( scnsl)is currently defined as lymphoma not originating from within the cns , and may be an isolated recurrence within the cns or may be part of the systemic progressive disease.2 additionally , scnsl may be further categorized as leptomeningeal , parenchymal , or as a combination of the two.3 in particular , an isolated relapse within the cns is rare , with retrospective cohorts typically numbering between 10 and 30 patients.4
