although research on plasma ethanol concentrations following paclitaxel administration has been published previously , only a few reports have evaluated the correlation between ethanol intake during chemotherapy and the ethanol concentration in exhaled breath . here , we investigated the concentration of ethanol in exhaled breath after chemotherapy with an intravenous paclitaxel infusion .
in contrast , the intravenous infusion speed had a relatively stronger positive correlation with the concentration of exhaled ethanol ( r = 0.49 ; p = 0.11 ) [ figure 1b ] .
thirty japanese outpatients ( mean age 55  8.6 years [ range 3574 ] ; 2 male and 28 female ) who received treatment with paclitaxel ( 80330 mg / day ) for breast , ovarian , or gastric cancer were eligible subjects for this research .
ethanol concentrations in exhaled breath of individual patients hepatic function in all patients was assessed to be within the normal range , as indicated by ast and alt values of 1233 u / l and 1262 u / l , respectively .
relationship between the ethanol concentration in exhaled breath and ( a ) the total amount of ethanol administered via the intravenous paclitaxel infusion ; and ( b ) the speed of the paclitaxel infusion .
