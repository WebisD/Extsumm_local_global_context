in summary , microwave treatment of soil samples followed by the measurement of fluorescence after addition of terbium proved to be a fast and easy method to assess the content of bacterial spores .
in particular , we were interested in the differentiation between different types of soil such as grasslands ( pasture , meadow ) , allotment gardens , and forests , as well as fluvial sediments , the relationship of soil parameters ( carbon - to - nitrogen ratio ) on the occurrence of bacterial spores , and the distribution of spores in relation to sampling depth .
the aim of this study was to adopt the fluorescence - based method to determine the spore content in soils sampled from various locations .
our study might provide a basis for the detection of  hot spots  of endospores in soil .
the distribution of spores in marine sediments ( determined as dpa ) showed only a low correlation with the content of total organic carbon and varied with the sediment type .
concentration of ortho - phosphate in soil extracts ( 22.5  m ) was reduced by the addition of aluminium chloride to concentrations below the detection limit ( < 1.2  m ) .
