the addition of high ptx3 levels to the pf5 and bnp levels , which were previously found to be prognostic in patients with hfnef , improved their risk stratification , as indicated by a substantial increase in the cstatistics and significance of nri .
multivariable cox proportional hazards analysis identified ptx3 ( hazard ratio [ hr ] : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ) , highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ( hr : 0.99 ; 95% ci : 0.97 to 0.99 ; p<0.05 ) , lvmi ( hr : 1.03 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ) , and bnp ( hr : 1.08 ; 95% ci : 1.03 to 1.14 ; p<0.001 ) as predictors of future cardiovascular events after adjustment for significant factors that were identified by univariate analysis ( table 3 ) . using the forced inclusion model , which evaluated levels of inflammatory markers and bnp ( model 1 ) in multivariable cox hazards analysis , ptx3 , but not hscrp , significantly predicted cardiovascular events ( hr : 1.17 ; 95% ci : 1.07 to 1.28 ; p<0.001 ) . in the forced inclusion model , which included pf5 and bnp , ptx3 significantly predicted cardiovascular events ( model 2 : hr : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ; model 4 : hr : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.06 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ) ( table 4 ) . furthermore , multivariable cox proportional hazards analysis identified ptx3 ( hr : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.01 to 1.35 ; p<0.05 ) and bnp ( hr : 1.21 ; 95% ci : 1.11 to 1.31 ; p<0.001 ) as predictors of future hfrelated cardiovascular events , including cardiovascular death and hospitalization for hf decompensation , after adjustment for significant factors identified by univariate analysis .
