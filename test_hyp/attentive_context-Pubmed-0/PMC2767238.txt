the average ratio of the 95th percentile and the mean intakes of energy and micronutrients from foods show a remarkable similarity across countries and age groups . for each nutrient it
the analytical process included steps 2 and 3 of the following four steps for each of the selected vitamins and minerals and for each selected gender and age group : calculation of mean intakes from each of the dietary surveys ( an estimate of mean european intake).calculation of the ratio between the 95th percentile and mean intake in each survey.calculation of the average of the ratios.calculation of the common estimate for high intake as the product between steps 1 and 3 ( an estimate of european 95th percentile intake ) . 
 
calculation of the common estimate for high intake as the product between steps 1 and 3 ( an estimate of european 95th percentile intake ) .
the average ratio of the 95th percentile and the mean intakes is a simple and suitable measure for calculation of an estimate of high intake from an estimated average intake by the four steps described in the methods section .
overall , the ratios can be divided into three categories : one category with overall ratios of the 95th percentile and mean intake between 1.48 and 1.58 ; this range in ratios is close to the energy ratio ( 1.45 ) and includes the nutrients : magnesium , phosphorus , zinc , iron , vitamin b6 , niacin , and folate.another category has overall ratios in the range between 1.67 and 1.79 and includes the nutrients : calcium , selenium , vitamin e , iodine , and copper.a third category has overall ratios in the range of 2.072.32 and comprises the nutrients : vitamin a , vitamin d , and retinol.in table 3 , ratios of energy and micronutrients for young and older children , and adult females and males are presented .
