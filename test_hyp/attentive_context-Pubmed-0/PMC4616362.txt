recurrent bladder carcinoma after pc is usually correctly diagnosed by urologists , because of the appearance of typical papillary in ultrasonography or cystoscopy , and can be easily confirmed by tumor biopsy . however , in this case series , we presented 3 patients with rare deceptive benign appearance of recurrent mibc after pc , which delayed timely diagnosis and treatment for 2 of them .
the present cases served to remind and alert the urologists to be aware of the possibility of bladder cancer recurrence even when the biopsy of the bladder lesion was benign . as a result , timely pelvic enhanced ct and turbt were necessary when bladder lesion occurred after pc , avoiding the possibility of missing mibc recurrence and delaying timely cystectomy .
early mibc recurrence after bladder sparing therapy could simultaneously occurred with cystitis glandularis caused by bladder surgery ; this rare situation might lead to diagnosis of cystitis glandularis without realizing bladder cancer recurrence and missed the best treatment opportunity .
partial cystectomy ( pc ) with pelvic lymph node dissection ( plnd ) combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy , which offers complete tumor resection , accurate staging and good quality of life , is regarded as a good bladder sparing treatment modality . even though , pc is still criticized for an unacceptable high recurrence rate .
