furthermore , we have genotyped the 
 above - mentioned cohort ( diabetic , obese , and control individuals ) , for two extensively studied snps in high linkage disequilibrium , pro12ala and c1431 t .
subsequently , we have extended 
 this analysis to a cohort of 205 
 unrelated obese patients and 254 control individuals .
g 
 nucleotide variation  possibly altering 
 ppar2 transcript abundance  may affect the 
 complex and highly regulated gene expression network in the eye , conferring in 
 turn the susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy .
indeed , recent studies have demonstrated that ppar ligands could both inhibit intraocular 
 angiogenesis and upregulate vegf gene expression in several cell types . to date , most of the mutation analyses focused on the coding region of 
 the pparg gene , and only few studies have analyzed snps in the 
 regulatory region of pparg possibly 
 associated with metabolic disorder susceptibility   . a novel functional variant in 
 the ppar2 promoter , c-2821 t , that associates with predictors of type 2 diabetes and 
 obesity , was recently reported in pima indians population . in attempt to analyze this variant in italian individuals affected by 
 type 2 diabetes , we have performed an snp 
 analysis on 211 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients from campania county , 
 southern italy .
