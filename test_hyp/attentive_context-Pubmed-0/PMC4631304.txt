platinum , ruthenium , rhodium , and iridium ( platinum group metals ) and gold together with silver ( copper group metals ) are known as noble metals .
we discuss the ones that are already used in oncology or have a therapeutic potential .
a is used together with gemcitabine as second - line chemotherapy in the treatment of metastases in non - small cell lung carcinoma .
other compounds used in clinical practice are kp1019 , and soluble salt kp1339 , which has finished phase i of a clinical trial in neuroendocrine carcinomas .
electroporation of kp1339 was tested in slovenia , and this method was found to be effective in vivo because of its extra antiangiogenic properties .
some researchers claim that ruthenium was first discovered in 1808 by jdrzej niadecki ; he called this element vestium in honour of the discovery of the planet vesta . the first ruthenium compound used in clinical practice was nami - a .
platinum ( pt ) , with atomic number 78 , atomic mass 195.08 , density 21.45 g / cm , and melting point 1772c , is quite rare in nature and usually is found together with ruthenium , rhodium , and palladium . in chemical compounds
