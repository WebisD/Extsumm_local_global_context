so , we need to view h2s in the point of dialectics , and we believe that further research on h2s , including animal studies and clinical studies , may provide a new insight into the treatment of stroke and other cns diseases , such as traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases .
although h2s is known as a toxic substance , increasing evidences have indicated that h2s plays an important role of neuroprotection in stroke , while its neurotoxicity can not be neglected .
researchers hope to provide a new direction for the therapy of stroke through studying h2s . after the endogenous h2s
stroke is a kind of acute cerebrovascular disease characterized by high morbidity , disability and death rates .
interestingly , although there are amounting evidences showing that h2s participates in the regulation of neuronal function and signaling pathway , concerning the neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of h2s still remains controversial . in our review , we will discuss the main mechanism and the possible role of h2s in stroke .
although the mechanisms of the injury are diverse , our treatment theory of neuroprotective strategies mainly focus on two aspects : on the one hand , we can activate the endogenous protective mechanisms of patients bodies to protect the brain from injury ; on the other hand , it is advisable to try our best to minimize secondary brain injury and promote the recovery of the damaged tissues . for many years , people have been trying to understand and search effective treatments for stroke from every conceivable angle . for now , for ischemic stroke , thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy has become regular treatments ( mandava et al . , 2015 ) , and for hemorrhagic stroke , hematomas cleaning operation and the stable control of intracranial pressure are conductive to improve the prognosis of patients ( siler et al . , 2014 ) . in addition
