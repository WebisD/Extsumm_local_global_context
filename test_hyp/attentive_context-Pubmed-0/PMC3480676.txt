, we extended the previous study and reexamined the relevance of pulse rate - associated single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from an additional gwas of 3,703 korean samples .
we previously reported pulse rate - associated loci from the korea association resource ( kare ) genomewide association study ( gwas ) , comprising 8,842 samples in the korean population . in this study
we observed 61 significant snps by applying only a threshold with a combined p < 1  10 . after excluding snps by cluster plot inspection and removing singletons , 3 independent snps ( that is , with pairwise linkage disequilibrium statistics r < 0.2 and maf  0.05 within a 500-kb window of the genomic region )
, we did not apply a threshold with a p < 0.01 in both ansung and ansan cohort in addition to a combined p < 1  10 for the snp selection for the replication study so that we could include more promising snps for their association with pulse rate .
our study was relatively underpowered to discover additional novel loci and demonstrated that large - scale genomewide meta - analysis comprising hundreds of thousands samples is required for understanding the missing heritability of pulse rate .
