this review aims to consolidate current evidence on their biological role and venture opinion on their potential impact in infectious disease .
given that mp are produced in response to many stress conditions and are involved in several immunological processes , it seems likely that mp are involved in the regulation of the immune response against invading pathogens , however , their potential role in infectious diseases has not been extensively studied .
since mp carry biological molecules from their cells of origin , they may induce associated responses in their target cells , depending on the source of mp , the cell type on which they act and the route by which they are incorporated .
however , there has been increasing interest in the role of plasma membrane - derived small lipid / protein vesicles in cell  cell communication in the last decade .
the paradigm of intercellular cell signaling mechanisms has until recently been assumed to be limited to direct cell  cell contact and via local soluble factor release .
also , how cellular decision - making occurs to produce mp , what they should contain , and whether production of the full range of membranous vesicles is required and/or produced kinetically to accommodate host requirements from initial infection to disease resolution , remains to be elucidated . as with most defenses against invading pathogens , on the one hand , the transfer of phenotype and function by mp may be of considerable benefit to the host , in the early warning and initiating of immune defenses at both innate and adaptive levels .
