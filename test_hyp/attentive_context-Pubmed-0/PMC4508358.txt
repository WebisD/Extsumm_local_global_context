a 78-year - old diabetic woman who presented with ascites and abdominopelvic mass was misdiagnosed with ovarian cancer and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy . however , pathology confirmed locally advanced cervical cancer stage iv in this patient .
although ascites has been reported in cases with cervical cancer , it is due to other causes such as ovarian metastasis .
considering all signs and symptoms to reach a verdict would reduce such malpractices and consequently lead to select the best management and treatment .
in conclusion , the combination of abdominopelvic mass , ascites , elevated ca125 , and negative human papillomavirus infection in conjunction with lack of attention to epidemiologic hints , dm history , bilateral hydronephrosis , and newly diagnosed cirrhosis misled us to diagnosis of ovarian cancer in this patient .
it seems that considering all signs and symptoms to reach a verdict would reduce such malpractices and consequently lead to selecting the best management and treatment .
our case was a menopausal woman who had diabetes mellitus and was a new case of cirrhosis .
