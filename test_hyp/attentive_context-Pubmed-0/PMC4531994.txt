the purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of clinically important histological abnormalities , prospectively in chronic diarrhea patients with strict inclusion criteria who have grossly normal or nonspecific colonoscopic findings , to ascertain the clinical significance of these findings to therapeutic decision - making and outcome .
one hundred and eighteen consecutive patients suffering from diarrhea who met our inclusion criteria and visited the gastroenterolgy unit of samsung medical center during a fifteen months period ( from april , 1995 to june , 1996 ) were evaluated prospectively in this study .
clinically significant histological abnormalities can exist in significant percentages , in spite of normal or nonspecific colonoscopic findings , which can justify routine mucosal biopsy in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea patients .
incidental findings , such as small polyps ( smaller than 0.7 cm , 19 cases ) , diverticula ( 3 cases ) , colonic cyst ( 1 case ) , submucosal tumor ( 1 case ) and angiodysplasia ( 1 case ) were discovered during the examinations ( table 1 ) . in the microscopic examinations , two cases of collagenous colitis ( fig . 1 ) and one case of lymphocytic colitis ( fig .
