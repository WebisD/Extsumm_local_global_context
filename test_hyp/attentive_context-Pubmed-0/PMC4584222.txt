thus , the present study was designed to obtain accurate prevalence data on rheumatic valvular abnormalities in school children using whf provided echocardiographic criteria .
echocardiographic prevalence of rhd was found to be 5.83 cases per 1000 children ( 95% ci , 2.5 to 9.1 ) .
thereby , systematic screening with echocardiography reveals higher prevalence of rhd as compared with clinical screening .
thus , the echocardiographic prevalence of congenital heart disease is 7.77 cases per 1000 children ( 95% ci , 3.3 to 10.3 ) .
the most common anomaly was mitral valve prolapse ( n = 15 ) and atrial septal defect ( n = 8) .
the study also showed feasibility to carry out echocardiographic screening of rhd using whf criteria in indian setting .
a total of 2060 school children aged 515 years from five government ( n = 1023 students ) and two private ( n = 1037 students ) schools were screened during the study period .
the results of the current study demonstrate that echocardiography is more sensitive in detecting clinically silent cases of rhd .
all the enrolled school children underwent clinical examinations which identified pathological murmur in 184 school children ( apical systolic murmur in 45 school children ) . out of these 184 school children with pathological murmur , echocardiography confirmed rhd in 5 ( 11.1% ) , corresponding to the clinical prevalence of 2.4 cases per 1000 children ( 95% ci , 1.1 to 4.2 ) .
