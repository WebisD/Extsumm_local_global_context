section iii presents the results and analysis , starting with the geometries 
 and vibrational frequencies , followed by the reduction potentials 
 and an analysis of the spin densities to determine the oxidation states 
 of the metal centers .
ii , we introduce the nomenclature for the species studied 
 and describe the computational methods used to calculate the structures , 
 co vibrational frequencies , reduction potentials , and pka values for these species .
, the computational 
 methods are benchmarked by comparing experimental and theoretical 
 structures , infrared ( ir ) vibrational frequencies of the co groups , 
 reduction potentials , and relative pka values .
the key features of this proposed mechanism highlight 
 the roles of the ammonium - hydride interaction , flexibility of the 
 bridging co ligand , and intramolecular electron transfer between the 
 fe centers in the catalytic cycle . while these bioinspired models 
 are effective catalysts for h2 production , the challenge 
 of designing molecular electrocatalysts that can perform with weaker 
 acids and lower overpotentials remains .
further investigation of the effects of ligand substitution at the 
 fe centers will help guide the design of more effective h2-producing catalysts .
the calculations illustrate 
 that the nhhfe dihydrogen bonding distance in the 
 doubly protonated species is highly sensitive to the effects of ion - pairing 
 between the ammonium and bf4 counterions , 
 which are present in the crystal structure .
