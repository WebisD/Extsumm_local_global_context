in general , the findings of the present study showed that playing a melody causes a balance in the neonatal physiological responses including respiratory rate and hr during heel stick .
our obtained results showed that playing music is an efficient intervention to maintain balance in neonates respiratory rate and hr during administration of painful procedures .
independent t - test showed no significant difference in the means of atrial o2 saturation between the melody and control groups before intervention ( p = 0.12 ) , during intervention ( p = 0.37 ) , and after intervention ( p = 0.63 ) .
lsd post - hoc test showed a significant difference in the means of respiratory rate before and during intervention , and during and after intervention in the melody group ( p < 0.05 ) .
independent t - test showed no significant difference in the means of hr in the melody and control groups before intervention ( p = 0.69 ) , during intervention ( p = 0.87 ) , and after intervention ( p = 0.42 ) .
the neonates in the group of melody ( study ) and the neonates in the control group were selected on the first and second days of the study , respectively .
