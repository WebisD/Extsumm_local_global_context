, we will illustrate the usage of computational framework on three case studies and discuss our predicted results with visualized networks .
in addition , our framework has also discovered some new donors not reported in previous studies , and further investigation of these new discoved donors indicates that they are possible donors in the biological and evolutionary perspective . while there is no standard benchmark to measure the accuracy of our framework , it should be noted that the accuracy of our framework depends on the performance of other prediction tools . on the one hand ,
therefore , exploring the origin donor of gis can also contribute to the analysis of genealogical phylogenetics . some previous research works of constructing donor - recipient network based on individual genes have been carried out   , where the network is composed of a set of vertices ( i.e. , organisms ) and edges , which connect vertices and reveal the occurrences of hgt between organisms . by studying the visualized networks
the availability of these gi tools , thus , provides us with a chance to study donor - recipient relationship through gis . in this paper
, we propose using gis to trace the origins of gis and study donor - recipient networks across organisms . to make our donor - recipient networks meaningful , we model edges as weighted , which can be represented by the number of gis that a donor genome contributes to a recipient genome . in a previous study
