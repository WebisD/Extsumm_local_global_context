the main object of this study was to investigate the safety of administering two different doses of bta towards the spg in 10 patients with intractable chronic ch with an open , uncontrolled design .
an improvement of headache impact as measured by hit-6 was seen during the follow - up , with a mean decrease after four weeks of 13.2 points ( p  =  0.018 ) , after eight weeks of 8.2 points ( p  =  0.064 ) and after 24 weeks of 11.0 points ( p  =  0.075 ) ( table 3 ) .
due to small sample size , uncontrolled design , and 30% protocol violators , interpretation of efficacy outcomes must be performed with caution . a single intervention and a long follow - up with restriction on acute and preventive medication may explain the high share of protocol violators , also seen in earlier studies ( 9 )

 in this pilot study sphenopalatine injection of onabotulinumtoxina in intractable chronic cluster headache seems to have an acceptable adverse event profile.efficacy data indicate a significant reduction of cluster attack frequency.randomised , placebo - controlled studies are warranted to establish both safety and efficacy .
