children of both sexes aged between 4 years and 5 years ( n = 1376 ) who were accompanied by their parents to the dental centre of the arab american university of jenin during the first 10 months of 2013 were examined clinically by one of the three calibrated examiners in the clinics of pediatric dentistry department after gaining the permission of the parents . as the families come from different geographic areas of northern palestine , the examined population was subdivided as shown in table 1 .
the mean dmft scores as well as caries prevalence in primary teeth of 4- to 5-year - old palestinian children reflect a considerable defect in the oral health care at home and at school , showing a real need to establish  school oral health programs  in the different regions of northern palestine   .
