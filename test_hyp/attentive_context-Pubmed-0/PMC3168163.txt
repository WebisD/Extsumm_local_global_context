this report describes camptodactyly for the first time in a girl with sotos syndrome and provides further evidence that sotos and weaver syndrome are allelic disorders .
sotos syndrome is a dysmorphic syndrome characterized by early overgrowth , developmental delay , advanced bone age and characteristic craniofacial appearance .
we describe a two and half years old girl born of non - consanguineous tamilian parents .
nsd1 gene mutations are also found in weaver syndrome where camptodactyly is a common feature .
fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) did not detect microdeletion of 5q35 in this patient .
microdeletions of chromosome 5 were not detected in our case suggesting a likely point mutation in the nsd1 gene and further evidence of that weaver and sotos syndrome are allelic .
sotos syndrome results from mutation involving the nuclear receptor set - domain - containing protein ( nsd1 ) gene , located on chromosome 5q .
congenital heart disease is not very common in this condition and overall incidence of cardiac defects is approximately 8% .
the mutational mechanism can be a point mutation in the nsd1 gene or a microdeletion that includes nsd1 .
a high frequency of congenital heart defects has been reported in patients with intragenic mutations of the nsd1 gene and phenotypic overlap with other overgrowth syndromes , in particular with weaver syndrome is seen . though this sotos patient is likely to have a point mutation of the nsd1 gene , this could not be confirmed due to lack of facilities .
