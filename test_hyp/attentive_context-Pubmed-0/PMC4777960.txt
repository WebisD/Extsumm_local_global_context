the kruskal - wallis test results revealed that there is no significant difference (  = 3.599 , p = 0.165 ) between the mild , moderate and severe dat groups in the activity and participation components of the icf .
multiple comparison by post hoc analysis revealed a significant mean difference between mild and severe dat groups ( p = 0.011 ) on the environment component of the icf . at the same time , multiple comparison indicated that there was no significant difference between the mild and moderate dat groups ( p = 0.140 ) as well as in the moderate and severe groups ( p = 0.351 ) ( table 4 ) .
therefore , it was crucial to study the impact of dementia on multiple functional domains of individuals .
thirty bilingual ( english - malayalam ) individuals ( 16 males and 14 females ) diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease in the age range of 65 - 88 years ( mean 77.4 , sd 6.6 ) participated in the study .
activity limitations and participation restrictions due to impairment in body functions and structure are highlighted as major criteria for the diagnosis of dementia .
it can be seen in table 1 that 10 individuals had moderate issues in the communication component and 20 individuals had severe issues . in the subdomain of learning and applying knowledge , 3 individuals had mild issues , 8 had moderate issues and 19 had severe issues . in the interpersonal interactions and relationship domain , 5 participants had mild level problems , 10 had moderate level issues and 15 had severe level issues .
