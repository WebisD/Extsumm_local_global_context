in this study we presented the hba1c values of nondiabetic and diabetic nhps ( macaca fascicularis ) , analyzed with an inhibition of latex agglutination assay ( hba1c - specific mouse monoclonal antibody adsorbent onto latex particles ) .  
objectives of the study reported here were to identify values for measurement of hba1c percentage in blood samples obtained from nhps ( macaca fascicularis ) to determine whether these percentages varied with respect to glycemic control after diabetes induction and insulin treatment .
total hba1c percentage can be measured with a user friendly assay and provides useful information for control of diabetes mellitus in nphs , as is done in human patients , and it could be used during the standard management of glucose metabolism in those animals .
hba1c measurements were also carried out after pig islet transplantation in diabetic nhp recipients in an attempt to assess whether this physiologic variable can be considered a suitable test to monitor glucose metabolism and provide a positive feedback after islet transplantation , particularly in long - term survivors . even if islet xenotransplantation of porcine islets in nhps restores normal blood glucose levels in diabetic recipients , to date no clear long - term effect has been fully demonstrated .
