we encountered a case where an infection with group a streptococcus ( gas ; ie , streptococcus pyogenes ) initially caused primary peritonitis and then subsequently caused streptococcal toxic shock syndrome .
a 40-year - old woman was admitted to the emergency department for lower abdominal pain and numbness in the extremities .
the patient was diagnosed with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome due to an ascending gas infection originating from vagina .
an emergency laparotomy was performed , and ascites that resembled pus and general peritonitis were noted .
the patient s life was likely saved by an emergency laparotomy followed by extensive peritoneal lavage and drainage .
a recent report demonstrated a 6-year - old girl who initially presented with presumed viral gastrointestinal infection for a week and later developed catastrophic primary peritonitis and septic shock requiring resuscitation and emergency exploratory laparotomy due to group a streptococci.6 the incidence of stss has increased over the past few years , so stss must be kept in mind as potential diagnosis if a patient has abdominal symptoms that abruptly worsen .
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome ( stss ) is a condition that suddenly and rapidly progresses as a result of an infection with group a streptococcus ( gas ; ie , streptococcus pyogenes ) .
