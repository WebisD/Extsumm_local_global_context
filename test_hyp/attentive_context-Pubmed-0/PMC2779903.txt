thus a comparison between these two groups provides us with an opportunity to assess the potential effects of dna strand bias on the amino acid composition of a well - characterized set of orthologous proteins .
( 2007 )  in the case of mitochondrial genes , strand - bias should be of particular concern and the previous use of mitochondrial genomes in resolving deep phylogenies requires critical re - evaluation. it remains to be seen if dna strand asymmetry can also affect the composition of proteins encoded by eukaryotic nuclear genes , as has been shown for biases in the gc content of nuclear genes .
since our goal was to measure the effect of strand asymmetry on amino acid composition , we chose a group of species , the platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) , in which the gc and at skews are opposite to those seen in mammals . among the flatworms , the coding sequences are rich in g and t and correspondingly poor in c and a , i.e. a complete contrast to the patterns seen in mammals
it is already known that dna strand asymmetries exist in nuclear genes but their effects on the composition of nuclear - encoded proteins have not been studied .
