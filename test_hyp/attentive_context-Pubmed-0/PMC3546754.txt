this large , cross - sectional , observational , systematic audit showed that , first , dyslipidemia is common among people with t2 dm in the uk and , secondly , that lipid concentrations generally and tg in particular remain elevated despite statin monotherapy .
atorvastatin diabetes study ( cards ) , a primary prevention study in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) , atorvastatin reduced coronary heart disease events by 36% , stroke by 48% , and mortality by 27%.3 in a meta - analysis of secondary prevention studies in t2 dm , statins reduced cardiovascular events by 28% and strokes by 32%.4 despite this efficacy , a considerable residual cardiovascular risk remains among patients receiving statin therapy.2,5 hypertriglyceridemia ( > 1.7 mmol / l ) alters the composition of atherogenic particles and may make an important pathophysiological contribution to the residual cardiovascular risk.6 indeed , the current european atherosclerosis society consensus statement recommends treating hypertriglyceridemia of 1.7 mmol / l.6 statins , as well as lowering ldl - c , reduce blood triglyceride concentrations by up to 40%.7,8 only a few previous studies have evaluated hypertriglyceridemia in statin - treated patients with t2dm.9,10 however , there is little data evaluating these patients in primary care in the uk .
