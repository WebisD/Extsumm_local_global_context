the publication of the genome sequence of two malaria parasites presents opportunities for post - genomic era malaria research including gene discovery and comprehensive understanding of gene expression
furthermore , the approach is demonstrated as a means to appraise critically the data quality of the increasing number of post - genomic datasets from malaria parasites .
an integrative approach was used to determine genes associated with transcripts differentially expressed between mixed asexual stage and late stage gametocyte parasites .
plasmodium falciparum asexual - overexpressed transcripts plasmodium falciparum gametocyte - overexpressed transcripts correlated stage - overexpressed transcripts in this study and that of li et al .   plasmodium falciparum candidate genes for studies into plastid metabolism
pathogen bioinformatics have been developed and applied as a vehicle to discover novel genes and the search for virulence - associated genes combining approaches that assay gene expression , adaptive evolution and gene transfer [ 1 - 3 ] . in this study ,
. the study has revealed ( 1 ) possible regulatory mechanisms in malaria parasites ' gametocyte maturation , ( 2 ) correlation between est and microarray data for a p. falciparum gene family to present unique est - derived information , ( 3 ) candidate genes on which computational and experimental studies can be performed , and ( 4 ) the need for more empirical studies on gene and protein expression in malaria parasites .
