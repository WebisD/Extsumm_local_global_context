relationship between common variables and mortality ( unadjusted ) and independent predictors of death ( adjusted )
out of all stroke patients seen from june 2007 to june 2013 , persons with ipcs presenting in the emergency unit and a neurology clinic of a tertiary hospital in kano were recruited for the study .
however , independent predictors of death in the study were hyperglycemia on admission and hemorrhagic stroke [ table 4 ] .
distribution of anatomical sites involved with infratentorial pcs distribution of the traditional risk factors across gender distribution of the clinical manifestations and their comparison across stroke types factors associated with death in the patients were hyperglycemia , high gcs , hemorrhagic stroke , and aspiration pneumonitis [ table 4 ] .
, we evaluated the clinical characteristics , risk factors , outcome , and predictors of outcome of pcs in northwestern nigeria .
