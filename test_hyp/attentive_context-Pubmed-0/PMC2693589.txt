we transfected culture - expanded msc with granulocyte macrophage - colony stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) and stem cell factor ( scf ) cytokine genes and then cotransplanted with cord blood mnc in nonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficiency ( nod / scid ) mice to further promote hsc engraftment .
were significantly increased in cotransplanted mice and even higher with the cytokine gene - transfected msc ( gm - csf > scf , p<0.05 ) than in transplantation of hsc alone .
our results indicate that msc may serve as a platform to deliver hematopoietic growth factors in clinical stem cell transplantation .
our results show that human cells were significantly increased in cotransplanted mice , and the number was even higher with the cytokine gene - transfected msc than with transplantation of mnc alone .
in this study , we transfected culture - expanded cord blood msc with gm - csf and scf cytokine genes and then cotransplanted with cord blood hsc to further promote hsc engraftment . the tnc count and the engraftment of cd45+/cd34 + cells and xx or xy positive human cells
msc with forced expression of interferon beta were shown to inhibit the growth of malignant cells in vivo ( 11 , 12 ) .
