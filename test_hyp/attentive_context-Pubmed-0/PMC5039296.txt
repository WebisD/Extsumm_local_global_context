this review focuses on the opioid growth regulatory system and its implications for the pathobiology of diabetes .
the function of the opioid growth regulatory system appears to be disordered in diabetic animals , and its function can be restored with ntx treatment to normalize corneal epithelial wound healing , corneal sensitivity , and tear production in models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes .
moreover , studies by our team relative to cutaneous wound healing in diabetic animals further support the hypothesis that the opioid growth regulatory system is disordered relative to wound closure , wound maturation , and the restoration of tissue tensile strength in nonocular tissue , specifically the skin .

the opioid growth regulatory system is a phylogenetically ancient growth regulatory system that has been conserved across multiple existing animal phyla and , specifically , in ocular tissue .
figure 1 highlights two of the main and opposing characters in this story : the naturally occurring opioid growth factor ( ogf ) , [ met]-enkephalin , and its pharmacologic antagonist , naltrexone ( ntx ) .
