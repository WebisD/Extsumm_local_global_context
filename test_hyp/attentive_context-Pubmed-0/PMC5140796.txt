the study results showed that the 
 moderate and highly active groups showed significant differences compared with the low 
 activity group in waist circumference , triglycerides , and hdl cholesterol , which are the 
 risk factors for metabolic syndrome .
furthermore , the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was low for workers with moderate and high 
 physical activities compared with those with low physical activity .
, the present study showed that low physical activity is associated with a 
 higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in white - collar workers whose work primarily 
 involves sedentary tasks .
the study also showed that the level of physical 
 activity was associated with waist circumference , fasting glucose , and hdl cholesterol . 

therefore , the present 
 study examined the relationship between physical activity level and metabolic syndrome by 
 considering the daily physical activity level of white - collar workers .
the present study examined the relationship between physical activity level and metabolic 
 syndrome in male white - collar workers by dividing the workers into low , moderate , and high 
 physical activity groups according to ipaq classification .
ci : confidence interval ; or : odds ratio with respect to metabolic syndrome factors according to the level of physical activity , the 
 odds ratio for hdl cholesterol level 40  mg / dl was 3.52 ( 95% ci , 1.627.67 ) , with the low 
 physical activity group having an increased risk compared with the high physical activity 
 group , and the odds ratio for fasting glucose 100  mg / dl increased to 2.36 ( 95% ci , 
 1.194.66 )
