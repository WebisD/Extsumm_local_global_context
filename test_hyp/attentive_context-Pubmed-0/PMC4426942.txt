performing ercp may be safer in the elderly and in patients with low levels of serum esr because they may be less at risk of pep .
the present study examined prospectively the potential patient- and procedure - related risk factors , including esr , for pep in iranian population .
using pre - ercp anti - inflammatory pharmacologic agents like nsaids might be beneficial , by lowering esr level and reducing related risk of pep .
we know that inflammatory biomarkers are useful at 2448 hours post procedure in predicting pep , and a few studies have evaluated pre - procedure inflammatory markers , especially c - reactive protein ( crp ) elevation , as predictors of pep.1723 none of the previous studies has focused on pre - ercp erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) as a potential risk factor for pep . despite the importance of identifying risk factors for pep ,
serum amylase was found to be elevated to more than 200 units / l in 102 patients ( 13.7% ) three hours after ercp and more than 800 units / l in 60 patients ( 7.7% ) . in all , 446 ( 70% ) participants underwent wire - guided cannulation and others ( 30% ) underwent sphincterotome biliary cannulation using contrast injection as the conventional method .
