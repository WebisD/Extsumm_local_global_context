in each situation the costs and benefits of hpv dna detection in urine , compared to alternative monitoring options , should be carefully considered.16,47
urine is an adequate alternative biospecimen for monitoring hpv prevalence in female adolescents to determine the early effect of hpv vaccination on a population level .
according to the world health organization ( who ) , 33 countries have implemented hpv vaccination as part of their national immunization program.41 generally , vaccination is provided to girls , and it is therefore recommended to monitor the impact of vaccination on hpv prevalence among female adolescents.15 in august 2012 , we identified four publications that reported hpv prevalence in urine samples from asymptomatic female adolescents .
hpv prevalence has been strongly associated with age , being nearly nonexistent in preadolescents , gradually increasing with sexual activity among adolescents , and generally peaking around 25 years of age.42 however , regional differences in hpv prevalence do exist.43 therefore , the first step when monitoring hpv prevalence is to establish the baseline hpv prevalence in the relevant age groups . to date , only hussain et al and oleary et al reported baseline hpv prevalence based on urine samples from a large unvaccinated adolescent population.24,25 the hussain et al25 study from india used self - collected urine of the cervix and that care should be taken when samples from healthy children attending public school and achieved a 57.3% participation rate .
