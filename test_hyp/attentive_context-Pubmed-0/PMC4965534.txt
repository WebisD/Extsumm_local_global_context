furthermore , nodular plca can originate from systemic amyloidosis or progress to systemic disease   . here , we present a case of nodular plca on the temple of a 52-year - old woman .
amyloidoses can be classified into three categories : primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis ( plca ) , secondary localized cutaneous amyloidosis , and systemic amyloidosis with cutaneous involvement . in the plca group ,
a 52-year - old lady presented with a soft , shiny , partially yellow , erythematous tumor ( 3.5  4.5 cm ) with telangiectasia on her right temple ( fig .
a punch biopsy taken during follow - up showed some remaining amyloid so that the patient is now scheduled to undergo a second surgery via curettage .
the diagnosis of plca requires histological analysis of a skin specimen , complemented by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy .
the first two are mainly located on the trunk , and cytokeratins serve as the amyloid precursors . here , amyloid deposition is limited to the papillary dermis   . however , in the rare cases of nodular plca , amyloid consists of aggregated kappa and lambda light chains , which can be found both in the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue   .
