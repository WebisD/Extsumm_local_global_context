the purpose of this study is ( 1 ) to establish a rat thoracic spinal cord stimulation model and ( 2 ) to compare effects of thoracic cord neuromodulation to that of sacral nerve neuromodulation on locomotor function , bladder and lower extremities muscles .
in a rat thoracic spinal cord contusional model , we failed to establish a rat spinal cord stimulation model .
further experimental studies are needed to establish a rat spinal cord stimulation model and to determine the most effective protocol of stimulation .
twenty sprague dawley rats of 6 months old female , weighing 200 to 250 gm , were randomly divided into 4 groups : a normal control group ( n=5 ) , sci with sham stimulation group ( sci , n=5 ) , and sci with electrical stimulation at thoracic spinal cord ( sci+tes , n=5 ) , and sci with electrical stimulation at sacral nerve ( sci + ses , n=5 ) .
this study was designed to establish a rat thoracic spinal cord stimulation model and to compare effects of thoracic cord neuromodulation to that of sacral nerve neuromodulation on locomotor function , bladder and lower extremities muscles .
they reported that one patient with a long history of progressive spinal multiple sclerosis was able to stand and transfer , but not walk , before the sacral nerve stimulation6).another paraplegic patient was showed improvement of motor power slowly , and after 2 years the patient could stand as confident as before6 ) .
