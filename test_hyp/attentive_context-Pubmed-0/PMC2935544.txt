however , intracellular carotenoids as part of the photosystem are known to mainly quench fluorescence emitted by other cell components ( lichtenthaler 1987 ; chappelle et al . 1991 ) . in this paper , we show that the carotenoid - containing globules produced by d. salina emit green fluorescence that can be detected with confocal laser scanning microscopy ( clsm ) .
fluorescence microscopy is a noninvasive imaging technique and can be used to study cellular processes in vivo .
absorbance and fluorescence measurements show that the fluorescence most likely originates from the -carotene in these globules .
this autofluorescence of the cells is emitted by chlorophyll in the red part of the spectrum and by the carotenoid globules in the green part of the spectrum . when comparing the relative quantum yields obtained from the absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra with data from literature
d. salina stores secondary carotenoids in lipid globules when cultivated under stress conditions . to visualise these carotenoid - containing globules , cslm can be used in combination with the autofluorescence of cell components .
we determined the relation between the carotenoid - containing globules and the green fluorescence and studied the possibility to visualise and localise these lipid globules inside the cells in vivo using this autofluorescence .
