for myeloid cell isolation , the amount of fetal bovine serum recommended in the macs isolation buffer was increased from 2% to 10% to improve cell viability .
this protocol can be modified , based on the size and source of the tumor ( subcutaneous , spontaneous tumor , or orthotopic tumors ) . for larger tumors , it is recommended to increase the amount of dissociation buffer , macs buffer , and number of washes .
one advantage of the described procedures is the reduction of tumor debris carry - over following extensive and rigorous washing .
it is also essential to keep all buffers and cells cold throughout the protocol to prevent non - specific ab binding and clogging of the column . in conclusion , to obtain highly enriched populations of antigen presenting cells and tumor antigen - specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes , we have modified and optimized an antibody - based isolation procedure utilizing the miltenyi biotech technology . utilizing this protocol , both adoptively transferred and endogenous leukocyte populations may be enriched using abs directed against cell type - specific surface markers .
tramp mice spontaneously develop autochthonous prostate tumors as a result of a transgene ( sv40 ) controlled by the probasin promoter .
