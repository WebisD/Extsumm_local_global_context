when combining the results of 25 case - control studies , they found that when comparing the highest category of coffee consumption to the lowest category , high coffee consumption was associated with a significantly reduced risk of colorectal cancer ( odds ratio ( or ) = 0.85 , 95% ci 0.75 , 0.97 ) and colon cancer ( or = 0.79 , 95% ci 0.67 , 0.95 ) but not rectal cancer alone ( or = 0.95 , 95% ci 0.79 , 1.15 ) .
