, we present the experience of a single institution with patients undergoing cryoablation and compare renal functional outcomes with those who underwent pn for such tumors .
both cryoablation and pn are viable techniques with acceptable preservation of renal function for tumors of a small renal mass .
although pn remains the standard of care , cryoablation offers an excellent treatment alternative , with less morbidity , comparable oncologic and functional outcomes , and faster recovery .
in conclusion , the increasing frequency of detection of tumors in solitary kidneys demands a better outlined strategy with stricter selection criteria for effective treatment choice along with long - term renal function maintenance .
patients who underwent pn had a longer mean duration of hospital stay ( 5.8 days vs. 1.8 days , p<0.001 ) and a higher rate of perioperative complications ( 53.3% and 8.7% patients , respectively , p=0.03 ) .
de novo development of ckd was seen in 3 of 8 patients ( 37.5% ) in the cryoablation group and 2 of 6 patients ( 33.3% ) in the pn group .
the choice of procedure ( cryoablation or pn ) and the approach ( open , laparoscopic , or percutaneous ) were chosen on the basis of tumor characteristics , co - morbid conditions , patient preference , and surgeon discretion .
