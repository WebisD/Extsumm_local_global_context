a 69-year - old woman with a transitional cell carcinoma in the renal pelvis underwent a laparoscopic nephroureterectomy .
the term anaphylaxis has been used for all types of acute life - threatening , generalized hypersensitivity reactions due to abnormal sensitivity to a triggering agent .
the patient 's cardiac arrest event was believed to be due to an anaphylactoid reaction in response to indigo carmine .
we focused on the five patients who experienced hypotension serially within a one month period , and suspected that flaws in production were responsible for these adverse reactions . during the manufacturing process
a diagnosis of anaphylaxis requires evidence of involvement of three or more organs and the detection of specific ige or a positive skin test to the alleged agent .
that patient , who was undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumor , manifested the complete spectrum of anaphylaxis five minutes after injection of indigo carmine , including hemodynamic collapse , cutaneous changes , laryngeal edema and bronchospasm . due to a lack of prior allergies or prior exposure to indigo carmine
sudden , severe hypotension after indigo carmine administration was first reported in a series of four patients with no known drug allergies who underwent radical prostatectomy under epidural anesthesia . due to the temporal association between indigo carmine injection and the hemodynamic change ,
