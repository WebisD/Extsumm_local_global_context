the present study reports the first case of a solitary leptomeningeal metastasis , mimicking a benign dumbbell - shaped neurinoma of a cervical nerve - root that was successfully treated with surgery and adjuvant radiochemotherapy ( rct ) .
therefore , an increasing incidence of the formerly rare symptomatic leptomeningeal metastases ( lm ) should be expected .
considering the growing number of medium- and long - term cancer survivors , future studies should focus on the improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic measures for patients with leptomeningeal metastasis .
the present case report emphasizes the importance of the differentiation between benign neurinomas and solitary lm in cancer patients . surgical treatment combined with adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy
still , in the present case , the localization , growth pattern and mri signal were concordant with a cervical neurinoma .
a 47-year - old woman was referred to our institution because of progressive unilateral arm elevation weakness with an onset 8 weeks prior .
mean survival after diagnosis of lm is about 7.5 months and one - year survival is 1022% . the described case presented with an atypical clinical presentation , consistent with a large neurinoma affecting the cervical plexus .
