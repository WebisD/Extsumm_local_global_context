the aim of this paper is to describe the current status of international collaboration in medical radiation science and compare this to other allied health occupations .
overall , medical radiation science is lagging in international collaboration in comparison to other allied health fields in their respective journals , although the mean international collaboration rate for the medical radiation sciences journal in the uk is quite competitive with physiotherapy and occupational therapy .
the importance of research collaboration has been recognised and strongly supported by research organisations and policy makers alike1 and there has been a marked rise in international collaboration in numerous industries over the last three decades.2 international collaboration is recognised for enhancing the ability to approach complex problems from a variety of perspectives , increasing development of a wider range of research skills and techniques , and improving publication and acceptance rates.3 these benefits could be leveraged to increase research capacity in medical radiation science and support the further development of our professional knowledge base .
if medical radiation sciences is to evolve as an evidencebased profession , we must increase research productivity and publication in our field .
the medical radiation science community needs to examine the strategies for encouraging international collaboration if goals of increasing research capacity in the profession and developing a more robust professional knowledge base are to be realised .
