cshmc in the dose of 20 mg / kg had shown more efficacies against the m. tuberculosis infection in guinea pigs compared with a dose of 5 mg / kg , which is comparable to isoniazid and rifampicin by histopathological data . in both doses
the present study was planned to evaluate antitubercular efficacy and safety of cshmc in isoniazid and rifampicin - sensitive strain in guinea pigs .
if infected with m. tuberculosis , they show striking similarities to natural infections in humans , thus making it a good model for testing the effects of drug therapy.  chemical structure of ( a ) coumarin ; ( b ) dapsone ( diaminodiphenyl sulfone [ dads ] ) ; ( c ) 8-[(4-chloro phenyl ) sulfonyl]-7-hydroxy-4-methyl-2h - chromen-2-one
effect of isoniazid , rifampicin , and cshmc on hemogram parameters in blood of guinea pigs after 30 days of treatment effect of isoniazid , rifampicin , and cshmc on liver and renal function parameters in blood of guinea pigs after 30 days of treatment
. the lesion scores of lungs , spleen , and liver were calculated in all the 5 groups after 30 days of the treatment the hemogram [ table 2 ] , liver [ table 3 ] , and renal [ table 3 ] function parameters were monitored after 30 days of isoniazid , rifampicin , and cshmc treatment .
