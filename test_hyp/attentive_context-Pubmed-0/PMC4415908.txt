moreover , the present study revealed that such reduced suppression of the dmn was significant only in adolescent - onset rmdd patients , putatively reflecting the more chronic course of early - onset mdd from a neurobiological perspective . on a brain systems level , adolescent - onset rmdd patients showed increased ampfc - dlpfc coupling , while all other connections within the wmn and dmn regions showed an inverse directionality .
the main goal of the present study was to investigate putative functional alterations of neural networks that are engaged or suppressed during wm performance in a large sample of adult drug - free rmdd patients and hc .
hence , we conducted a cross - sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) study in a large sample of adult fully remitted and drug - free mdd patients as well as adult healthy controls ( hc ) without any previous psychiatric life - time diagnosis . additionally , we investigated possible behavioral and neural differences with respect to age of mdd onset , because adolescent - onset mdd contrasts clinically with its adult - onset counterpart with regard to chronicity , severity , vulnerability , and stress - sensitivity ( harrington et  al . , 1990 ;
