the aim of the study was to assess the serum levels of some cytokines involved in the th17 and th22 responses in psoriatic patients .
furthermore , serum levels of il-20 , il-22 , and il-17 , which correlated with the clinical severity and activity of psoriasis , may be objective parameters of successful treatment and may be used in the followup .
no significant correlations were found between the concentrations of the studied cytokines and the sex , age , or psoriasis duration in the studied patients ( p > 0.05 ) .
significantly higher il-6 values were found in the psoriatic patients in comparison to the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .  
very high concentrations of il-22 in the patients ' serum can be connected with intensive il-6 stimulation . il-22 and il-20 itself induce production of il-20 , which is elevated in our study .
  the statistical analyses of the conducted study results revealed significantly higher serum levels of il-6 , il-20 , and il-23 in psoriatic patients comparing to healthy controls ( table 1 and figure 2 ) . significant correlations between il-20 , il-22 , il-17 , and psoriasis severity were observed .
