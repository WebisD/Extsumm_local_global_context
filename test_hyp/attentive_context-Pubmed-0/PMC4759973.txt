is associated with v - shape palatal morphology , increased nc , and decrease in the upper arch length and inter- first upper premolar distance .
in addition , the upper arch length was significantly shorter ( 35.6  2.5 ) in the snorer subjects than the nonsnorer group ( 36.4  2.5 ; p < 0.038 ) , and the inter- first upper premolar distance was significantly narrower ( 39.6  2.6 ) in the snorer subjects than in the nonsnoring group [ 40.8  2.9 ; p < 0.013 ; table 3 ] . orthodontic observation of facial profile , malocclusion class , arch morphology and palatal shape orthodontic observation of dental cast measurements ( meansd ) in snorers and non - snorers
clinical observation of snorers and non - snorers extra - oral variables accordingly , the mean neck size was found to be significantly greater for the snorer group ( 36.6  2.5 ) than nonsnorer group [ 35.4  2.6 ; p < 0.007 ; table 1 ] .
the present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of snoring among male adult at university population setting and to compare the craniofacial features of an adult with and without snoring using clinical examination .
