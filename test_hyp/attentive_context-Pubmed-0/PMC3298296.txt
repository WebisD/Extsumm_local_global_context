the identification of this previously unknown pathogen within the m. tuberculosis complex identifies new concerns for human and animal health and illustrates the continuing scope of the threat posed by tb pathogens .
this newly identified mycobacterial pathogen has many unique ecologic characteristics that set it apart from other members of the m. tuberculosis complex .
the fact that new host - adapted m. tuberculosis complex species continue to be identified illustrates the diversity within the m. tuberculosis complex and stresses the need for sensitive techniques for species differentiation .
an in - depth histologic evaluation was performed on a subsample of 8 of these animals from the 2008 outbreak .
during 20002010 in chobe district , botswana , we performed 38 necropsies on macroscopically tb - positive mongooses , of which 18 were further evaluated and tb was confirmed by histopathologic examination .
organism differentiation required an extensive suite of additional molecular assessments not available at that time , thus underscoring the difficulty of diagnosing m. tuberculosis complex agents correctly and the inability of most national health laboratories to do so .
this finding is consistent with pneumonic tb being present in only a few advanced cases of disseminated tb .
