in the present cross - sectional study , we investigated cortisol and dhea levels and periodontal status in elderly subjects and found that levels of the salivary stress - related hormones cortisol and dhea were useful for screening for periodontitis in subjects who had never smoked .  
these results indicate that these stress - related hormones are useful indicators of the risk for periodontitis , as they showed moderate levels of sensitivity and specificity for periodontitis . within the study limitations regarding smoking status , the present method of determining cortisol and dhea levels may include a possibility as screening test for periodontal disease in the near future . additional approaches to reveal a new type of screening test system for periodontitis as an alternative to the conventional probing method are required .
smoking is known to be associated with elevated cortisol and dhea levels . in a recent report that compared cortisol profiles of smokers and nonsmokers over the day , cortisol levels were elevated in everyday life among smokers compared with nonsmokers , and the differences in values were quite substantial , averaging 35% or more on both working and weekend days . in the present study ,
