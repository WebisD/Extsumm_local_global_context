we analysed semen samples for free radical levels , particularly the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , total antioxidant capacity ( tac ) and sperm dna damage to evaluate if irpl is associated with poor sperm quality in terms of dna damage and oxidative stress .
early diagnosis of oxidative stress should warrant prompt antioxidant supplementation and life style modifications to the best of our knowledge , this pilot study showed a positive correlation between dfi and ros and an association between increased free radical levels and loss of dna integrity in couples experiencing irsa .
thus , this study was designed with the aim to evaluate the role of sperm factors , oxidative stress and dna damage in irpl following spontaneous conception . in this study
the assay of oxidative stress and integrity of the sperm dna is essential in couples with irsa following natural and induced conceptions .
no significant differences in age , seminal volume , liquefaction time , ph and sperm concentration were observed between male partners of idiopathic rsa cases and controls , but sperm morphology and motility were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) lower in male partners of patients with irpl ( table 1 ) .
