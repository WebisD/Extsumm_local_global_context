the aim of this study was to identify the volatile flavour components of african oil bean seeds during natural and pure culture fermentation and to relate these to the fermentation progress .
a vast array of volatile compounds has been identified in fermented pentaclethra macrophylla seeds ( ugba ) .
clearly , a proper understanding of the roles of the various flavour compounds will assist in the modulation of ugba flavour for the various possible uses of this important fermented seasoning and for a possible use in food processing industries and homes as a seasoning .
the variety and quantity of these volatiles change with the time of fermentation and the participating populations .
a total of 36 aroma compounds made up of 12 hydrocarbons , 10 esters , 5 alcohols , 2 phenols , 2 ketones , and one of each of furan , amine , acid , thiophene , and lactone were identified at different fermentation periods during natural fermentation ( table 1 ) . at the end of the pure culture process ,
although relatively small amounts of aldehyde , ketone , furans , amines , lactones acids , and thiophenes were identified in this study , they are expected to play important roles in the aroma of ugba because of their low detection / aroma thresholds as has been reported in roasted chicory , in the dry scented thai flowers used in tea production   and in roasted malaysian almond nuts .
