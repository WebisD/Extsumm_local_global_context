the works of this paper as a whole can be used in retina image processing system , which is highly desirable for large - scale screening programs . however , our proposed method is sensitive to optic disc location approach and vessel segmentation results ; in the future we need to adopt a better optic disc location method which can handle large exudate in the diabetic retinopathy images and make our method more robust to handle inaccurate vessel segmentation results .
in this paper , we focus on automatic segmentation of the optic disc based on 2d fundus image .
template matching and circle hough transform are used to locate the optic disc and find an estimated circle radius . in the vessel erasing step , we use inpainting approach to remove vessel which is better than the closing operation and mean neighbor replacement . our proposed optic disc segmentation method is based on image texture and active contour model .
the traditional methods often mistake ppa region as a part of optic disc . in order to solve the problem
the optic nerve head segmentation results show that the proposed method is able to achieve better segmentation accuracy for optic disc comparing to other existing methods .
