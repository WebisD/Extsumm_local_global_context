. the clinical spectrum of infection in a substantial proportion of hmpv - positive patients has been described , and studies are continuing to fully elucidate the clinical effect of infection with this virus in our community .
finally , this comprehensive study , conducted for 48 months , is the first one aimed at establishing an accurate estimate of the incidence and seasonal distribution of hmpv infection and to determine the genetic variation of hmpv circulating in our population
we collected nasopharyngeal aspirate ( npa ) specimens from january 2001 through december 2004 from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection in queensland , australia .
the results of recent , similar studies suggested that peak periods of infection with hmpv predominate during winter in the northern hemisphere .
when analyzing disease severity in this sample with a 2-sided test of proportions , we saw no significant difference between patients with a co - infection and those without . therefore , our data did not support the suggestion by others that co - infection of hmpv with rsv or other viral respiratory pathogens is a risk factor for severe disease ( 6 ) .
our study found that the peak period of hmpv infection in queensland , australia , occurs predominantly in spring ( august  october ) but that hmpv can be detected in every month .
