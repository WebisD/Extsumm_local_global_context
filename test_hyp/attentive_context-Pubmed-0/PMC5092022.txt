further , the spatial bias is small ( 5% or less ) for aerial nozzle testing due to the high concurrent airspeeds evaluated . to determine the optimal test method to reduce the spatial bias with our current low and high speed wind tunnel facilities ,
similarly , the concurrent airspeed used in ground nozzle testing should be verified and adjusted to the 6.7 m / sec recommended .
one option our group has used with great success is a class of experimental designs called response surfaces that allow for the development of droplet size prediction models based on a limited number of experimental treatments allowing for an extremely efficient evaluation of multiple spray nozzles and solutions .
sizing evaluations were conducted under multiple combinations of concurrent air velocity and measurement distance ( distance from the nozzle exit to the point of measurement ) , representative of the operational range of the existing facilities .
this is a bigger challenge than it seems given the seemingly endless combination of nozzle type , nozzle setup and operational factors , airspeed and nozzle position ( aerial spraying ) and real - world tank mixes used by the agricultural application industry .
laser diffraction measurements were compared to imagery results to determine the potential spatial bias and the optimal combination of measurement distance and concurrent airspeed was selected as the standard operational procedure
