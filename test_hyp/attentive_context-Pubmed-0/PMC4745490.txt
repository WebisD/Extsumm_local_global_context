chia proteins hydrolyzed with the alcalase - flavourzyme sequential enzyme system resulted in hydrolysates with ace - i inhibitory activity .
the present study objective was to identify and quantify ace - i inhibitory activity in protein hydrolysates from a salvia hispanica protein rich fraction hydrolyzed with an alcalase - flavourzyme sequential system , and in ultrafiltered fractions from this hydrolysate .
ultrafiltration produced a very low molecular weight fraction ( < 1  kda ) which had the highest activity .
, ace - i inhibitory peptides must reach the cardiovascular system in an active form , meaning that they need to remain active during digestion by human proteases and transport through the intestinal wall into the blood .
studies of the structure - activity relationship in ace - i inhibitory peptides have shown that those with potent inhibitory activity have proline , phenylalanine , or tyrosine at the c - terminal , as well as hydrophobic amino acids in their sequence . in light of this previous research ,
enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrafiltration are promising bioprocesses for production of new bioactive food ingredients such as ace inhibitory peptides purified from chia hydrolysate .
the main challenges in doing this are determining bioavailability of ace - i inhibitory peptides after oral administration and the fact that peptides may influence blood pressure by mechanisms other than ace - i inhibition . to exert an antihypertensive effect after oral ingestion
