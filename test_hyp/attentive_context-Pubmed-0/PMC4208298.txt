we highlight a unique cause of chronic cough : the initial symptom of lymphoma compressing the brainstem .
chronic cough is a frequent presenting complaint to not only the general practitioner but also the otolaryngologist and respiratory specialist .
although clearly cerebral lymphoma is a very rare cause of chronic cough , we believe that clinicians in primary and secondary care should consider rare central causes of chronic cough in cases where neurological symptoms or signs are present , or in cases where empirical treatment for the more common causes of cough fails to provide symptomatic relief .
a 69year - old gentleman presented to his general practitioner with a 3-month history of progressive unsteadiness . on further questioning
however , to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of a lymphoma around the brainstem with chronic cough as one of the first symptoms .
diagnosis can be difficult , especially in primary care , but empirical treatment for common causes such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , gastro - oesophageal reflux disease , postnasal drip or drug - induced cough ( most commonly secondary to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition ) is recommended when there are no associated worrying symptoms , and is successful in the majority of cases .
