development of spontaneous pneumopericardium is a very rare complication of tuberculosis with coexisting human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection . to the best of our knowledge
only three cases of pneumopericardium with pulmonary tuberculosis concomitant with hiv infection  have been reported so far .
a 30-year - old hiv - positive male smoker on antiretroviral therapy ( art ) presented with complaints of cough with expectoration and fever for two and a half months .
treatment is required in cases of large and symptomatic pneumopericardium or in patients of tension pneumopericardium , which can be a needle aspiration or tube decompression .
oxygen therapy in high concentrations as in management of pneumothorax can also be helpful in absorption of air .
the possible mechanism of pneumopericardium in this case could either be a severe bout of cough or a fistulous communication of pericardium with an infected contiguous organ .
computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the chest confirmed the presence of pneumopericardium [ figure 2 ] .
x - ray chest pa view showing patchy infiltration in both the upper zones with pneumopericardium ct scan showing bilateral infiltration with pneumopericardium ct scan showing cavitary lesion on the left side with pneumopericardium barium swallow fluoroscopy ruled out any esophagopericardial fistula .
