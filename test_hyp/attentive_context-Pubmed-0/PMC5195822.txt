accordingly , this review paper will summarize and highlight the recent publications supporting the role of osteoblasts in bone metastasis .
patterns of tumor metastases are dependent on the recipient organ microenvironment , and each component of the metastatic tumor microenvironment plays distinct and unique roles in disease progression . to better understand organ - specific metastases and to ultimately develop more effective therapeutics
the majority of research data concentrate on osteoclasts , and thus the current therapeutic approaches targeting the metastatic bone microenvironment are mostly osteoclast inhibitors ( e.g. , bisphosphonates , denosumab , and cathepsin k inhibitors ) . on the other hand ,
numerous research groups have demonstrated that other types of cells , particularly osteoblasts , are also important in the metastatic bone microenvironment , and also that osteoblasts play distinct and essential roles in metastatic progression .
beyond the conventional concept of tumor - initiative and bone - responsive process , recent data are focused on how the cells in the bone environment ( i.e. , osteocytes , osteoblasts , and osteoclasts ) initiate the dormant disseminates tumor cells in bone .
the homeostasis of the human skeletal system is maintained by the coupling of bone resorption ( by osteoclasts ) and new bone formation ( mainly by osteoblasts ) .
