it is emerging that heterogeneous hsc populations in the bone marrow coexist and coordinately give rise to hematopoiesis . in combination with other markers ,
a proportion of hscs lacking cd150 meet the conventional criteria for hsc activity in primary recipients , but these cells largely lack durable self - renewal in secondary transplant assays .
absence or low expression of cd150 on hscs is associated with the acquisition of powerful lymphoid reconstitution potential . in the future
2008 ) about whether cd150 hscs exist into perspective and suggest that the answer is to some degree arbitrary .
high expression of cd150 appears to identify cells at the very top of the hematopoietic hierarchy , as it is correlated with high self - renewal and marks the only cells with the potential to give rise to themselves , as well as to all other stem cell populations after transplantation .
deciphering the regulation of different hsc populations and investigating their potential cross talk is an important task for the future .
the slam family member cd150 allows for the prospective enrichment of hsc populations with distinct characteristics .
these findings dovetail with data demonstrating ( with an entirely different hsc enrichment strategy ) that cd150 expression predicts successful repopulation of secondary recipients ( kent et al . , 2009 ) .
