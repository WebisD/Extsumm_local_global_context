the present specimens are similar to the majority of the thalli described by benjamin and majewski .
the present species was always collected near the basal portion of the legs and on the inferior surface of the abdomen and thorax of its hosts , but according to thaxter ( 1931 ) , this species was always found on the inferior surface of the margin of the left elytra .
the specimens described here poses the additional appendiculate cells between the subbasal cell and the third cell , and immediately below the perithecium , as shown in the thalli drawn by majewski ( fig .
2 ) the distal portion of the perithecium has a tapered habit in the present species , while it is truncated in the previously described species .
thalli of this species have always been found on the inferior surface of the host 's abdomen , however the present materials were always found on the inferior margin of the left elytra .
this species is closely related to c. curvatus , but it is different from the latter due to its abruptly bent or strongly sigmoid habit and the recurved tip - portion of its perithecium .
