the aim of this commentary is to place these developments in context by reviewing the pharmacotherapy of obesity in terms of its past , present and future . to set the stage , it is important to recognise that , following preclinical identification of potentially important new therapeutic agents , human drug trials progress through several phases of development .
despite an inauspicious history , the pharmacological management of obesity is at an exciting crossroads .
phase i typically focuses on tolerability , safety and pharmacokinetics ; phase ii on proof of concept ( mechanism , efficacy and safety ) ; phase iii on confirmation of efficacy and side - effect profile in large - scale multi - centre trials ; and phase iv on long - term monitoring and data collection following governmental approval .
in this context , major recent advances in our understanding of the basic neurobiology of appetite and energy homeostasis have identified numerous targets for potential anti - obesity drug development ( wilding , 2007 ; heal et al . , 2009 ;
new treatments are essentially on the horizon , and novel research strategies have very recently come to the fore
however , even for those agents that meet preliminary requirements for selectivity of action and potential safety profile , extensive real - world testing is likely to be required by regulators , not only showing efficacy in terms of weight loss but also demonstrating long - term benefits for diabetes prevention and treatment , cardiovascular disease , and psychiatric safety . finally , successful discovery and development of potent and safe drugs for the prevention and treatment of obesity will probably require polytherapeutic strategies as well as vastly improved tools for the identification and characterisation of specific obese subpopulations that allow for the tailor - made development and appropriate use of personalised medicines .
