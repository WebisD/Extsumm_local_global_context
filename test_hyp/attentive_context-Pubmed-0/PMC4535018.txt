other anatomical levels of the esophagus can be predicted accurately as shown in the previous results . in conclusion , we consider that an accurate appraisal of the true length of an adult esophagus can be made by measuring the height and the other external measurable parameters .
then , we analyzed these data and extrapolated the various esophageal lengths with measurable external body intervals to obtain the correlations .
the study was conducted for the measurement of esophageal length in 196 persons , 97 males and 99 females , with normal esophagogastric endoscopic findings .
we correlated several external body intervals with esophageal lengths by the multiple stepwise regression method : standing height , sitting height , the distance from the 7th cervical vertebra to the coccyx and the distance from the upper incisors to the occiput .
we conducted this study to determine the mean esophageal length of various anatomical levels and to derive a method approximating true esophageal lengths .
the development of improved capability in medical and surgical managment of esophageal disease processes has been significant . to understand and appropriately use current technologic advancements , the anatomic properties of the esophagus
the best approximation of esophageal length would be useful for various clinical procedures , such as placement of a ph meter , manometer and nasogastric tubes , insertion of an endoprosthesis and colonic interpostition for both benign and malignant stenotic segments .
