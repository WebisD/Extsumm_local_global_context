, we hope to have a better understanding of cst degeneration in umn - predominant als patients and to identify quantitative dti measures which may be useful in objectively differentiating disease subtypes .
dti performed at 1.5 t as part of routine clinical brain mr imaging demonstrates abnormalities in fa and related parameters predominantly at the ic level of the cst in umn - predominant als patients compared to control subjects .
in addition , patients with cst hyperintensity have abnormalities of the ad and rd components of fa , while those without cst hyperintensity do not , suggesting differences in tract microanatomy .
predominance of dti abnormalities at the ic level and rostrally suggests an anterograde process arising from a neuronopathy of motor neurons forming the cst .
therefore , the main goal of this study was to use dti obtained at 1.5 t as part of routine clinical neuroimaging of als patients with predominant umn signs for quantitative evaluation of the intracranial cst , which in one group was hyperintense on t2- and pd - weighted sequences .
identification of these dti abnormalities in umn - predominant als patients from routine clinical scans demonstrates feasibility of acquiring useful quantitative information with a 1.5 t magnet system .
