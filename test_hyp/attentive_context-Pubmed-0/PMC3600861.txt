we need a better understanding of the molecular genetics and the underlying neurobiology and endocrinology of this trait .
the more species we investigate , the more costs and benefits we measure , the more theory we develop , and the more new tools we develop to study the genetics , neurobiology , and hormonal underpinnings of boldness , the better we will understand boldness in nonhumans and , eventually , humans .
we need a deeper understanding of the phylogenetic  that is , evolutionary  history of boldness .
what were the underlying costs and benefits that drove the evolution of risk - taking in this system ?
we need mathematical models of risk - taking ; these models are only just emerging in the growing animal literature on behavioral syndromes .
another practical application of work on animal personalities centers on the use of animals to aid disabled people . to become a guide for blind people , for example
almost nothing is known about this , though alexander weiss has some fascinating ideas about the relationship between the evolution of personality traits in humans and that of our closest living relatives.14 i m optimistic on all fronts .
