a 23-year - old engineering graduate presented with primary palmoplantar hyperhidrosis , for which he was advised an alternate day schedule of tap water iontophoresis .
he achieved an excellent reduction in palmoplantar sweating without any adverse effect , within 3 months of starting iontophoresis . a simple user - made iontophoresis device
he followed an alternate day schedule of 20 min utes immersion for initial 4 weeks , followed by once a week for next 8 weeks .
the device was constructed with a rechargeable 12 volt battery , two aluminum trays and copper wires , and connecting clamps [ figure 1 ] .
tap water iontophoresis is a reliable and effective method for the treatment of palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis , when practiced with appropriate technique and timing .
iontophoresis is defined as passing of an ionized substance through intact skin by application of direct current ( dc ) .
on his next visit , he presented with a very simple iontophoresis device that he devised on his own .
many dermatologists consider simple tap water iontophoresis to be first line therapy for primary focal palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis .
a monday - wednesday - friday schedule should be followed until the condition improves ; subsequently , the treatment should be tapered once a week for 8 weeks and then once a month for maintenance .
