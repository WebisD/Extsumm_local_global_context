quantification of transporter expression in various human tissues , including the interindividual variability in expression due to age , sex , or genotype , will be invaluable for prediction of in vivo disposition of drugs from in vitro data .
we compared these methods using four hepatic drug transporter proteins , that is , organic anion transporter polypeptide ( oatp ) 1b1 , oatp1b3 , oatp2b1 , and p - glycoprotein ( p - gp ) .
signature peptide based quantification of proteins using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) is increasingly used to measure endogenous or therapeutic proteins because it is a high - throughput , selective , and sensitive method when compared with other quantitative proteomics and immunoblotting methods . in this approach , the analyte protein
as assessed by the paired student 's t - test , the population mean ( sd ) protein expression ( fmol/g of membrane protein ) in twenty livers estimated by the sil versus silac method was not significantly different for oatp1b3 ( 0.97  0.47 versus 0.94  0.54 ) or p - gp ( 0.34  0.23 versus 0.34  0.25 ) but was marginally different for oatp1b1 ( 1.86  0.68 versus 2.07  0.77 ) and oatp2b1 ( 1.91  0.50 versus 2.10  0.73 ) .
