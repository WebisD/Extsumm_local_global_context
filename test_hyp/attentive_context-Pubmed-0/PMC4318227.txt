application of myocardium necrosis biomarkers in the stat version contributes to a significant decrease in tat and allows for obtaining a good result of an analysis  recommended tat < 60 min .
we should answer the question : is it possible to determine the markers of acute coronary syndrome easily , promptly , and accurately and receive reliable results ? having analyzed these observations , we decided to determine and compare the analytical quality of the tests in the standard and stat versions for determining serum level : cardiac isoform of troponin t with high sensitivity method ( tnths ) , ckmbmass , and myoglobin , as well as to verify whether the tnths stat test meets requirements for use in patients with acs .
the new generation of stat cardiac markers has high analytical quality , guaranteeing high analytical and clinical reliability of results .
thanks to this test , new possibilities have open up for cardiologists , especially in the treatment of acs in patients with no persistent st- segment elevation   and in patients with coronary disease , as a predictive test . methodological modification for tests used in determining cardiac biomarkers has been in use for more than 1 year now . it reduced the time of the analytical procedure from 18 min ( the standard version of the test ) to 9 min ( the short turn - around time version of the test ) .
