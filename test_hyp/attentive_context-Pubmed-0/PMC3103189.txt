this compound also demonstrated in vivo efficacy in murine models of infection that is equivalent to currently marketed tetracycline antibacterial agents .
a novel , fully synthetic series of 8-azatetracycline analogues was prepared and optimized . through modification of the 7- and 9-positions , compounds were found that overcome both tet(k ) efflux and tet(m)-mediated ribosomal protection .
the 7-dimethylamino-8-azatetracycline 20f was efficacious when administered intravenously and had oral bioavailability in rat equivalent to tetracycline .
the current work demonstrates the ability of this chemistry platform to generate antibacterial compounds that are inaccessible through traditional semisynthesis , providing the medicinal chemist a broader array of tools through which essential antibacterial properties can be modulated .
the 7-chloro-9-alkylamino-8-azatetracycline 24l exhibits clinically relevant mic90 profiles against both gram - positive and gram - negative organisms that include these resistance mechanisms .
more recently , the 9-substituted glycylcyclines , such as tigecycline ( 5),(13 ) and the aminomethylcyclines , such as amadacycline ( 6),(14 ) have shown improved activity for resistant organisms bearing the ribosomal protection mechanism . in 2005 , myers and co - workers published a fully synthetic route to the tetracyclines , the key step of which involves the michaeldieckmann condensation of the ab precursor 8 with structurally diverse d - ring precursors .
