in this study , cla supplementation , in addition to significantly reducing the serum level of il1 , increased appetite score , average caloric intake , and average macronutrients intake in copd patients . considering the findings of this study , it can be concluded that cla supplementation increases appetite and nutritional intake and improves nutritional status of copd patients , which , in turn , lead to decrease in malnutrition , slow progression of the disease , and may reduce the mortality .
copd is a common respiratory condition , which occurs with pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications , accompanied by systemic inflammations and is characterized by irreversible airflow limitations.1 it has been predicted that by 2020 , it would be the third most common cause of death and the fifth most common cause of disability worldwide.2 smoking and factors such as contamination of the workplace , environmental pollution , and genetics are found to be the main causes of this disease.3,4 extrapulmonary complications that occur in copd patients are appetite reduction , decrease of caloric intake , and malnutrition.5 malnutrition leads to increased risks of mortality among these patients.6 the increase of inflammatory factors such as serum level of c - reactive protein7 and inflammatory interleukins ( ils ) such as il1 , il6 , and also tumor necrosis factor- has been found to be among the possible causes of malnutrition.8 in various studies , the increase in the serum level of ils such as il1 and il6 as well as tumor necrosis factor- has been reported in these patients.911 the increase of il1 strongly causes anorexia , increased energy consumption , loss of muscle protein , and leptin release of adipose cells , which , in turn , lead to malnutrition.12,13 the use of dietary supplements is usually recommended for the treatment of malnutrition after copd diagnosis , and it has been reported that the nutritional supplementations can improve nutritional status , anthropometric factors , and body weight,14,15 reduce disease symptoms,16 and improve quality of life.17 one of the supplements used along with treatment is conjugated linoleic acid ( cla ; polyunsaturated fatty acid ) , which is naturally found in animal sources.18 in recent years , increasing attention has been paid to the beneficial effects of cla on individuals health status.19 to mention a few findings , researchers have discovered that it improves food sufficiency , energy metabolism,20 and anti - inflammatory properties.21 the effect of cla on some of the inflammatory factors has been demonstrated in previous studies;21 however , scant studies have examined its effect on the nutritional status and caloric intake of copd patients . therefore , this study aimed to evaluate the effects of cla supplementation on the nutritional status of copd patients .
