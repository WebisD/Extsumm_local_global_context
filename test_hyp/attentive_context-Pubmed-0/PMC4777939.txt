, we show the multimodal images of this case including en face oct images during the course of vkh disease .
we report a case of vkh disease in which recurred serous retinal detachment was treated successfully with steroids , but the last recurrence did not respond to the steroids and angiographic findings suggested csc . here
both vogt - koyanagi - harada ( vkh ) disease and central serous chorioretinopathy ( csc ) develop serous retinal detachment , and since recently , it has been well known that in both diseases , the thick choroid can be seen on optical coherence tomography ( oct ) .
careful follow - up is warranted in vkh patients since secondary csc may develop during steroid treatment . en face oct observation of the choroid
finally , the discontinuation of steroids was effective to resolve the fluid . from the fa and icga ,
the en face oct images of the choroid reflect those differences well and increase the accuracy of the diagnosis .
this patient was initially diagnosed with vkh because of the bilateral disc swelling and characteristic hyporeflective dots on icga with thick choroid on oct .
in this study , we use swept - source oct ( dri oct-1 , topcon , tokyo , japan ) , which allows superior visualization of the choroid thanks to a 1,050-nm wavelength light source and a scanning speed of 100,000 a scans / second .
