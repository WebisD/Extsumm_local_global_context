to model the process of malignant transformation , samples of normal oral mucosa and squamous cell carcinoma were also investigated .
our results suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 and ki67 expression may have a prognostic value for evaluating the malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia , and that the etiopathogenesis of oral leukoplakia should be investigated in terms of risk factors other than smoking and alcohol consumption .
the aim of this clinicopathological study was to assess the prognostic value of cox-2 and ki67 expression for oral leukoplakia by determining their association with histomorphological data .
the mean number of cox-2 expressing cells was lowest in n tissue samples , higher in the scc and oin than in the hk group , and higher in the scc than in the oin group ( p = 0.0001 ) . 

the occurrence of oin is relatively low for the c1 clinical type , and higher rates of malignant transformation have been reported for the c2 type . in the present study , 5/23 ( 21.7% ) c1 and 6/7 ( 85.7% ) c2 olep cases presented oin .
the occurrence of oin was associated with a non - homogeneous clinical aspect ( p = 0.004 ) , but was also observed in lesions with a homogeneous appearance ( three oin1 and two oin2 patients ) .
