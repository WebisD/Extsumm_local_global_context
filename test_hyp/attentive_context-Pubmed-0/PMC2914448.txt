the aim of the present work was therefore to evaluate the molecular determinants of the  dual effect  of neutrophils on pigr / sc expression in human bronchial epithelial cells .
our previous in vitro study showed that neutrophils could induce on one hand pigr / sc cleavage and on the other hand upregulation of sc production in epithelial cells , suggesting a  dual effect  of neutrophils on pigr / sc .
more particularly , the involvement of soluble mediators in the epithelial pigr / sc upregulation by neutrophils was investigated , as well as the role of proteinase / antiproteinase and redox balances and of intracellular mapkinase signaling pathways .
the cellular and molecular determinants of this ( im)balance and fine tuning of pigr expression will be further investigated in primary cultures of airway epithelial cells from copd patients .
we previously observed that the bronchial epithelium of severe copd displays a strongly reduced pigr / sc expression , which correlated with airway obstruction and neutrophil infiltration .
this study shows that , in an in vitro coculture system set up to address the mechanisms of pigr / sc dual regulation by neutrophils , increased epithelial sc production was observed at intermediate numbers of neutrophils ( corresponding to 10  nm elastase released ) , while further increasing neutrophils downregulated sc , presumably due to proteolytic cleavage ( > 20  nm elastase ; ) and/or cytotoxic effects . in addition ,
