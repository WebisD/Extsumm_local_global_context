herein , we present the attained results from a different salt , that is , napf6 aqueous solutions , in which the anion is closer to br from a chemical point of view . a comparative study between an asymmetric bilayer muscle ( comprised of two different cps ) and
in addition , some devices present creeping effects ; after an oxidation / reduction cycle some devices do not recover the initial position.18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 recently , irreversible reactions taking place in some cps were identified as one of the creepingeffect origins ( chemical creeping).28 
  by changing the solvent , some cps move from a reactiondriven exchange of cations to reactiondriven exchange of anions.29 , 30 , 31 by changing the salt ( nabr and nacl ) in aqueous solutions , the ppy  hpps / tape ( ppy  hpps : polypyrrole  paraphenolsulfonic acid blend ) , the muscle moves from reactiondriven exchange of br to a consecutive exchange of cations ( na ) and anions ( cl ) in nacl.33 those results should indicate that the muscle actuation , and the reactiondriven ionic exchange in cps , is conditioned by the variation of the intra and intermolecular forces inside the polymer under the influence of different physical or chemical variables . by changing the solvent or the salt , the dielectric constant , permittivity , dipolar moments , polymerion interactions , or salt dissociation degrees in both the dense polymer gel and the electrolyte should change , altering the ionic exchanges and the concomitant actuation mechanism .
