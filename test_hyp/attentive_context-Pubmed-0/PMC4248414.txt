rehabilitation nutrition is a combination of both rehabilitation and nutrition care management , and this concept is used with international classification of functioning , disability and health guidelines to evaluate nutrition status and to maximize functionality in the elderly and other people with disability .
rehabilitation nutrition can be used to improve functionality in people with sarcopenic dysphagia and sarcopenia with disability
the key aims of rehabilitation nutrition assessment   are to assess the following : ( 1 ) the presence and cause of malnutrition ; ( 2 ) the presence and cause of sarcopenia ; ( 3 ) the presence and cause of dysphagia ; ( 4 ) the adequacy of nutrition care management with prediction of future nutritional status ; and ( 5 ) whether rehabilitation for functional improvement , such as resistance training and endurance training , can be conducted .
sarcopenic dysphagia is an important current and future public health issue , because it is common in the elderly and can lead to aspiration pneumonia , the prevalence of which is increasing with the aging of society .
the term  rehabilitation nutrition  is quite different from that of  nutritional rehabilitation . 
sarcopenia with disability induces sarcopenic dysphagia which is characterized by the loss of swallowing muscle mass and function associated with generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and function .
