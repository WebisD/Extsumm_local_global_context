a hypothesis has been put forward , mostly focused on the overproduction of cyslts and arachidonic acid pathways .
aerd often produces a moderate - to - severe phenotype ; however , diagnosis in these patients is challenging despite the availability of various techniques .
aspirin - exacerbated respiratory disease ( aerd ) refers to the development of bronchoconstriction in asthmatics following the ingestion of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs .
most of the genetic studies have been performed using techniques such as gwas and the candidate gene approach .
future areas of investigation should focus on identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis with various diagnostic techniques .
considering the pathogenic mechanism of aerd , various genetic markers have been suggested in various ethnic groups and are summarized in this paper .
it is defined by a clinical syndrome associated with moderate - to - severe asthma and eosinophil inflammation in the upper and lower airways , resulting in chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma .
these genetic studies will be able to extend our understanding about the molecular genetic mechanism of aerd and to find a genetic marker for predicting drug responses or hypersensitivity reactions .
furthermore , this will be helpful for the determination of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions .
