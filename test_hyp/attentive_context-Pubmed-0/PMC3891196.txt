esophageal perforation is an exceedingly rare complication following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( acdf ) .
a 24-year - old man presented to an outside hospital following a motor vehicle accident with cervical spine fractures of c5 - c7 , anterolisthesis of c6 and associated spinal cord transection with resulting quadriplegia .
the incidence of these complications ranges from 0.02 to 1.52% although is higher when it is a result of trauma . we describe a case of a 24-year - old man who underwent acdf and corpectomy following a motor vehicle accident who developed delayed onset aspiration pneumonia and dysphagia requiring surgical repair of an esophageal perforation . to the best of our knowledge
we believe this paper will provide a deeper understanding to the intensivist in regards to postoperative airway management in this type of patient .
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is a commonly performed surgery for the treatment of spondylosis , radiculopathy , myelopathy , and trauma .
there has been no prior literature discussing airway management in patients who underwent esophageal repair for perforation following cervical spine surgery .
the patient was taken to the operating room and underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion ( acdf ) of c5 - 7 , c6 corpectomy with polyetheretherketone ( peek ) cage and c4 - t1 posterior fusion [ figure 1a ] .
