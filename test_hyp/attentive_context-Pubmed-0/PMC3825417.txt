because of the lack of information on arrested growth and tumor regression after incomplete resection of low - grade cerebellar astrocytomas in children , the aim of this study was to provide more information on these phenomena by reviewing cases of patients with cerebellar astrocytoma who underwent surgery at our hospital .
we reviewed all cases of patients under 16  years of age who were diagnosed with cerebellar astrocytoma and underwent surgery at kaohsiung medical university hospital from january 1983 to december 2011 .
we found that several tumors treated with radiotherapy after surgery had malignant transformation and do not recommend adjuvant radiation treatment for children with cerebellar astrocytoma who have subtotal resection .
we have documented that patients with subtotal removal of cerebellar astrocytoma can have arrested tumor growth or spontaneous tumor regression during long - term follow - up . following partial resection of pediatric cerebellar astrocytoma
medical charts , imaging findings , operative notes , histopathological reports , and survival times of 12 patients with cerebellar astrocytoma were reviewed for the purpose of evaluating the patients prognosis ; patients lost to follow - up were excluded .
in this study , we analyzed the long - term follow - up results of 12 patients with childhood cerebellar astrocytoma : five of whom had total tumor resection and seven of whom had subtotal tumor resection . as expected , total tumor removal was an important prognostic factor .
