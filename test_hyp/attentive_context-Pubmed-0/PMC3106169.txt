our goal was to evaluate the impact of bicycle riding on luts and sexual dysfunction in men with the use of amateur marathoners as a control group of physically equivalent individuals with a low level of perineal pressure or trauma .
concern about bicycle riding as a leisure sport has recently increased as many urological outpatients and healthy recreational bicyclists have questioned urologists about the relationship between bicycle riding and prostate - related luts and sexual dysfunction . in our opinion , bicycle riding seems to have no statistically measurable effect on luts or sexual functioning in men , at least in amateur recreational bicyclists .
there is a need for further large - scale research on this subject and study of the underlying mechanisms leading to cycling - related luts and sexual dysfunction .
we present a cross - sectional study of the effects of bicycle riding , a sport with perineal impact , on genitourinary function in men . in our study ,
the mean calculated volume of the prostate by trus was 23.32 cc and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( 23.32 vs. 23.71 , p=0.848 ) .
also , the serum tpsa level was within the normal range in all subjects and there was no significant difference between the two groups ( 0.800 vs. 0.888 , p=0.470 ) . the prevalence of a significantly low qmax , excess pvr , or benign prostatic hyperplasia was not significantly different between the two groups ( table 3 ) .
