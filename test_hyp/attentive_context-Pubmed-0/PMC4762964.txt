the tip of the catheter was notably missing , and an emergency chest radiograph confirmed our diagnosis of a retained fracture of central venous catheter .
endovascular approach to retrieval of retained fractured catheters has helped tremendously to reduce associated morbidity and the need for major surgery .
complication following fracture of a central venous catheter can be catastrophic to both the patient and the attending doctor .
the retained portion was removed by the interventional radiologist using an endovascular loop snare and delivered through a femoral vein venotomy performed by the surgeon .
the role of surgery has become limited to instances of failed endovascular retrieval and in remote geographical locations devoid of such specialty .
catheter fracture has been attributed to several factors namely prolong mechanical force acting on the catheter , and forceful removal or insertion of the catheter .
we report our experience with a successful retrieval of a central venous catheter utilizing the combined endovascular and open approach .
a third year medical resident noticed an incomplete catheter tip post removal of a right subclavian central venous catheter in a 56 year old man diagnosed to have end - stage renal disease .
this , however , does not rule out the need for surgery in case of failed endovascular therapy .
