( i.e. , 2.5 cases / rcp ) , and the rhne department identified 56.6% ( i.e. , 1.2 cases / rcp ) .
this study of hadrontherapy healthcare decision networks in the rhne - alpes region , able to identify areas not properly covered by rcps , should enable us to analyse the potential effect of this lack on the outcome of the patients of these areas .  
this led to a sense of ownership and motivation on the part of the centres . as a whole , the study covered the region 's 11 hospital areas and involved 52 groups , out of some sixty listed , of cancer specialists with expertise in the diseases that were to identify . during the study ,
  the study involves 13 clinical research technicians , 50 rcp coordinating physicians and 12 cancer coordination centres ( see table 3 ) .
the geographic areas not covered by the study correspond to the location of 15 private healthcare centres and to the medical activity of six general and four specialist rcp groups .
all cancers have their own development pattern , and , in this respect , the literature provides few elements concerning diseases eligible for hadrontherapy .
