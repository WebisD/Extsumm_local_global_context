aneurysmal bone cysts ( abcs ) are rare entities which cause expansile and destructive bone lesions characterized by reactive proliferation of connective tissue1,5 ) .
togetherness of abc and fibrous dysplasia , giant cell tumors and/or osteoblastomas are defined as secondary abc by some authors and this association was seen aproximately in 20 - 30% of cases .
age , location , size and number of mitotic figures have been suggested for recurrence treatment of abc is difficult and histological examination should be done to prevent overlooked of an underlying more aggressive neoplasm .
thoracic mri images and ct scans demonstrated a mass which causes mass effect on spinal cord ( fig .
