we have used fluoxetine in combination with an experience - dependent paradigm of visual deprivation , to analyze the large - scale gene expression patterns , to understand the temporal - dependent changes that allow the reopening of the critical periods in the adult brain .
this study provides a large - scale analysis of changes in patterns of gene expression associated with the reopening of the critical period of plasticity in the adult visual system induced by the combination of fluoxetine treatment and monocular deprivation .
our findings suggest a scenario where an enhanced serotoninergic transmission induced by long - term fluoxetine treatment induces a shift of the inhibitory - excitatory balance   , which in turn promotes an alteration in the expression of genes involved in different biological themes that may underlie the functional modifications in the adult visual cortex related with the reopening of the critical period plasticity .
importantly , these results open up new insights into the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the reopening of the critical period in the adult brain , by providing the basis of gene expression patterns for a visual deprivation paradigm that demonstrates the ability of the nervous system to translate environmental stimuli into structural and functional changes of neural circuitries .
