we think the spine robot system will be used in clinical practice with the development of preoperative planning simulator and intraoperative electromyography monitoring system in the near future .
this study to feasibility and clinical value of robot - assisted navigated drilling in percutaneous pedicle screw placement .
the operation time and intraoperative fluoroscopy times per pedicle screw was less , but we should improve the accuracy and reliability of spine robot system such as building the preoperative planning simulator and intraoperative electromyography monitoring system for clinical use .
additionally , the results would form the basis for the development of a new robot for pedicle screw fixation surgery .
especially the minimally invasive pedicle screws insertion , the surgeon is only provided with intraoperative two dimensional x - ray images for the alignment and positioning of the pedicle screws and in up to 40% of the cases a perforation of the pedicle occurrs , depending on both the surgeon 's performance and the definition of error.456 there was also much more radiation exposure to the surgeons during minimally invasive pedicle screws placement.78 in order to ease the surgeon 's hand - eye coordination and to reduce the iatrogenic radiation injury to the surgeons , a robot assisted surgery is expected to increase the quality of percutaneous pedicle screw placement .
