beewolves and antibiotic - producing streptomyces bacteria participate in a defensive symbiosis involving both vertical and horizontal symbiont transmission .
could greatly advance our understanding of the biogeographic history of the ancient association between beewolves and streptomyces , and thereby illuminate larger questions about the relative importance of animal - vectored and free - living dispersal in shaping the distribution of microorganisms in nature .
a well - established theoretical framework for the evolution of cooperative interactions contrasts  partner fidelity  and  partner choice  as the most important mechanisms promoting and maintaining cooperation .
the biogeographic history of beewolves is well defined , but that of the symbionts is only loosely concordant with it , suggesting global dispersal or vicariance .
previous studies have empirically shown that partner choice via host sanctions or differential rewards can stabilize cooperation in environmentally transmitted symbioses like mycorrhizal fungi or nitrogen - fixing rhizobia of plants , while the specialized intracellular symbioses of insects are generally assumed to be stabilized by partner fidelity .
the recent isolation of closely related streptomyces strains from moroccan soil and from chilli pepper rhizosphere in thailand could provide evidence for the environmental occurrence of the beewolf symbionts , although the phylogenetic affiliation of these isolates with the symbiont clade is currently based on 16s rdna only and needs confirmation by multi - locus sequencing .
