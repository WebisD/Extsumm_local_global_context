the aim of this study was to evaluate , in vivo , the microbiological conditions of root canals of teeth with chronic periapical lesions after biomechanical preparation using different endodontic irrigants .
groups 1 ( naocl ) and 2 ( chx ) presented significant cfu reduction , less than the mean of groups 3 ( saline solution ) and 4 ( no mechanical preparation ) . in relation to the microorganisms , the anaerobes presented a greater mean of reduction ( p<0.05 ) and the other two , aerobic and microaerophilic , presented lower means , but were not significantly different to each other ( p<0.05 ) .
, there was a reduction in microorganisms in relation to groups 3 and 4 , where there was an increase in the number of microorganisms .
after experimental induction of periapical lesions , the root canals were prepared using the following solutions for irrigation : group 1 ) 2.5% sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ) ; group 2 ) 2% chlorhexidine ( chx ) ; group 3 ) saline solution and group 4 ) control group with no biomechanical preparation ( table 1 ) .
the teeth selected for the study were the second , third and fourth mandibular premolars and the second and third maxillary premolars , adding up to seventy - eight root canals .
