ish is a rapidly progressive painful disorder of infancy with a very short life expectancy .
3 months old identical twins born to a 5th degree consanguinous couple were brought with complaints of excessive cry , deformity of all four limbs , recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea since birth .
infantile systemic hyalinosis ( ish ) is a rare and fatal genetic disorder with mutations in capillary morphogenesis gene-2 cmg2 / human anthrax toxin receptor gene-2 antxr2 resulting in spindle cell proliferation , altered collagen metabolism with extensive deposition of amorphous eosinophilic pas positive hyaline material in the connective tissues of various organs .
evaluation of both the probands revealed facial dysmorphism with perinasal nodules , gingival hypertrophy , fixed deformities of multiple joints bilaterally , umbilical hernia , fleshy perianal nodules and pigmented patches over knuckles and ankle . a clinical diagnosis of ish was suspected and confirmed by detection of homozygous c.277_278insattattt ( or p.l93yfs*14 ) in exon 3 of the antxr2 gene .
the common presenting features would be progressive stiffness of multiple joints , skin lesions , multiple episodes of protracted infections , prolonged diarrhoea and failure to thrive .
ihs is commonly misdiagnosed as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and is often mismanaged with manipulation of the stiff joints and invasive surgical procedures .
