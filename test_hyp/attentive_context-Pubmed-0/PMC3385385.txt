toe to thumb transfer is an excellent option in these patients and helps restore both function and esthetics.  we have performed a bilateral second toe to thumb transfer in a patient who underwent bilateral traumatic thumb amputation .
we had a long term follow up ( defined as > 3 years ) for the patient , as by this time the neural recovery is almost complete , and most of the adaptation to the newly reconstructed thumb has occurred . in our case ,
replantation is indicated in all cases ; however , may not be possible in cases with unsuitably amputated thumb .
traumatic loss of thumb leads to significant loss of function as the thumb contributes to about 40% of the hand functions . when the loss is bilateral , it is more devastating .
a 25 year old male presented to our department with the traumatic amputation of both the thumbs distal to the metacarpophalangeal ( mcp ) joint , and at the proximal 1/3 of the proximal phalanx while working on punch press machine [ figure 1 ] .
thus to conclude , bilateral second toe to thumb microvascular transfer restores excellent hand function with minimal morbidity in the foot [ figure 8 ] . primary toe transfer , not only decreases the convalescent period and the medical costs , but also ensures early return to work . besides , it gives bilaterally symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing thumbs [ figure 9 ] . minimal donor side morbidity which goes unnoticed excellent strength achieved after toe transfer
