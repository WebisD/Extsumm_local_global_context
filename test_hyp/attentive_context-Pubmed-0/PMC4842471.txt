subjects were randomized into 
 three group : the shoulder joints 60 flexed trunk stabilization exercises group ( group 1 ) , 
 shoulder joints 90 flexed trunk stabilization exercises group ( group 2 ) , and shoulder 
 joints 120 flexed trunk stabilization exercises group ( group 3 ) .
the purpose of this study was to identify whether bending the 
 shoulder joints with a sling strapped at an angle in the prone position effectively thickens 
 the core muscles and increases static and dynamic balance abilities in a standing 
 position .
