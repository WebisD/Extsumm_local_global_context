the auc for the prediction of cvd mortality was 0.70 , using traditional framingham risk variables , and increased to 0.75 ( p = 0.0001 ) with the addition of cac to the model ( fig .
risk of cardiovascular mortality at 7.4 years predicted by models with and without cac in dhs a separate analysis found no significant interaction between cac and race ( p = 0.5 ) and cac and sex ( p = 0.7 ) in the prediction of cvd mortality .
baseline demographic characteristics and risk factors stratified by cardiovascular mortality in the dhs cohort during 7.4 years of follow - up , 92 cvd deaths were identified : myocardial infarction ( n = 40 ) , coronary artery disease ( n = 24 ) , cardiac arrest ( n = 12 ) , congestive heart failure ( n = 12 ) , and stroke ( n = 4 ) , as annotated in death certificates .
1 ) . in a multivariate analysis , adjusted for age , sex , race , smoking , total and hdl cholesterol , systolic blood pressure , and antihypertensive medications , the ors ( 95% ci ) for cvd mortality using cac scores 09 as a reference group were cac 1099 : 2.93 ( 0.7419.55 ) ; cac 100299 : 3.17 ( 0.7022.22 ) ; cac 300999 : 4.41(1.1529.00 ) ; and cac 1,000 : 11.23 ( 3.2471.00 ; fig .
