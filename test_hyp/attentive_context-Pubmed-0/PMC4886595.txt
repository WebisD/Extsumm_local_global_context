keratoelastoidosis marginalis of hands ( kemh ) , is an acquired , marginal , acrokeratoderma that predominantly affects the radial side of the index finger , first web space , and ulnar side of the thumb .
differential diagnosis of keratoelastoidosis marginalis of the hands keratoelastoidosis marginalis is a progressive disease of a benign nature .
the occurrence of seborrheic keratosis , solar elastosis , favre  racouchot syndrome and cutis rhomboidalis nuchae are commonly noted signs of chronic actinic damage .
prolonged uv exposure , heavy manual work , and repeated trauma to the hands seem to be the etiologic factors .
burks et al . in 1960 reported the first five cases of this acquired disorder and termed it as degenerative collagenous plaques of the hands .
a 75-year - old farmer presented with asymptomatic lesions over the web spaces of the thumb and index finger of both hands and raised lesions over his face since 15 years .
hereditary forms also include punctuate palmoplantar keratoderma ( ppk - pt ) , hereditary papulotransluscent keratoderma and mosaic acral keratosis , whereas the acquired forms are kemh or degenerative collageneous plaques of the hand and digital papular calcinosis .
topical keratolytics such as salicylic acid and tretinoin provide temporary relief with recurrences on stopping application . apart from lesions of kemh , both our patients also had features of chronic actinic damage , in the form of waxy , yellowish , deeply wrinkled skin over the forehead , cheeks , nape of the neck ( cutis rhomboidalis nuchae ) along with senile comedones and nodular elastosis ( favre  racouchot syndrome ) .
