 the present study confirms that patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas will experience severe xerostomia subsequent to radiotherapy , with no statistically significant differences between males and females . 

salivation 1 : salivation before radiotherapy    : all the subjects 
 
 salivation 2 : salivation 3 weeks after radiotherapy    : males    : females 
 
 salivation 3 : salivation at the end of radiotherapy   :males compared to females 
 
 pearson s correlation coefficient demonstrated the following : there was no statistical relationship between the decrease in salivary flow rate and all patients age ( p = 0.76 , n = 30 , r = -0.057 ) , males age ( p = 0.96 , n = 19 , r = 0.011 ) and females age ( p = 0.539 , n = 11 , r = -0.208 ) . 

means of salivation at the end of treatment in the study population , in males and females separately were 0.420.31 ml , 0.440.33 ml and 0.380.28 ml in 5 minutes , respectively ( table 1 & 2 ) . 
 

mean values of salivation in the third week after the initiation of treatment in the study population , in males and females separately were 0.840.35 ml , 0.850.38 ml and 0.800.90 ml in 5 minutes , respectively .
