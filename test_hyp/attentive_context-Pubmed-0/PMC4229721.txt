establishment and maintenance of cellular polarization are critical features for development and organ function . apical - basolateral ( a / b ) polarity of epithelial cells serves to perform vectorial functions , like transport of fluid or directed secretion of specific proteins . besides the ubiquitous epithelial a / b polarization , most epithelial tissues present a second polarity axis within the epithelial plane , referred to as pcp .
cortical microtubules align perpendicular to the margin in proximal wing regions , supporting a general role for the orientation of cortical microtubules in pcp   and in the realignment of pcp later in development
how individual cells that are hundreds of cell diameters apart acquire the same polarity within the plane of an epithelial organ is a fascinating cell biological problem .
many processes and organs requiring pcp have been subsequently discovered in vertebrates ranging from skin and body hair orientation , positioning of primary cilia , and sensory epithelium in the inner ear to directed movement of mesenchymal cell populations during gastrulation among many other processes ( for example ,   ) .
these observations set the stage for analyses of local and global signals to work on pcp orientation : local signals with short - range abilities to communicate on a cell - to - cell basis and global signals that coordinate the process at the organ level over a long range .
