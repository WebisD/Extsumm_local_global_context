a 50-year - old male patient , a known case of copd , presented with the features of bpf on the right side for 1 month .
common causes of bronchopleural fistula ( bpf ) are lung resection , thoracic surgery , thoracic trauma , pulmonary koch 's , rupture of lung abscess and rupture of emphysematous bullae , as was seen in this case .
large bpf and those associated with entrapped lung or empyema thoracis are managed with surgery .
use of intercostal muscle flap is an easy and effective technique for the repair of bpf .
bronchoscopic techniques used for the closure of bpf include application of glue , gelfoam and/or stents ; these techniques are usually successful when the size of the fistula is small .
bpf is commonly associated with empyema or empyema develops subsequently if management of bpf is delayed . in this case ,
bpf is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and its management depends on various factors like size of fistula , respiratory reserve of the patient , associated diseases and general condition of the patient .
the intercostal muscle flap , as was used in this case , is easy to harvest , causes no functional disability , has adequate vascularity , has adequate length to reach most of the sites and is harvested through the same incision used for thoracotomy .
