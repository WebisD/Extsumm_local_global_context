the results obtained in this study following the administration of 0.04mg / kg and 0.08mg / kg per day of msg to adult wistar rats caused some cellular hypertrophy of the columnar epithelium , distortion of the basement membrane separating the endosalpinx from the myosalpinx .
degenerative and atrophic changes , which were more pronounced in those that received 0.08mg / kg of msg .
twenty four , ( 24 ) adult female wistar rats with average weight of 230 g were randomly assigned into three groups a , b and c of ( n=8 ) in each group .
degenerative and atrophic changes and lysed red blood cell which were observed were more pronounced in the groups treated with higher dose ( 0.08mg / kg ) of msg . as a result of the distortion and disruption in the lumen of the fallopian tubes , the ciliary action and other functions of the fallopian tubes may have been highly affected as a result of probable toxic effect of msg . it may be inferred from the present results that higher dose and prolonged administration of msg resulted in degenerative and atrophic changes observed in the fallopian tubes .
this work was carried out to investigate some probable histological effects of msg on the fallopian tubes and its likely involvement in female infertility in nigeria .
