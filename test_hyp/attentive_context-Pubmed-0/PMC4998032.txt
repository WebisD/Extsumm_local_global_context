in the us , ~800,000 women are diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease ( pid ) each year.1 however , the us centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) estimates that more than one million women experience an episode of pid each year taking into account missed cases of pid.2 the rates of pid are concerning given the serious potential sequelae of pid , including tubal infertility , ectopic pregnancy , and chronic pelvic pain ( cpp ) . missed and/or improperly or inadequately treated cases of pid increase the risk of complications of pid.3 not only
does the severity of these complications highlight the seriousness of the disorder , but also young women indicated that they are willing to give up 12 years of their life to prevent pid and its associated sequelae , as reported in a recent health economics study using time trade offs to assess patient utilities for the health states associated with pid in a general population sample.4 pid is an infection of the female upper reproductive tract , including the endometrium , fallopian tubes , ovaries , and pelvic peritoneum.5 sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) , such as chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae , are commonly implicated in cases of pid , but they are not the only organisms associated with clinical disease . the diagnosis of pid is made difficult by variation in clinical manifestations : subclinical patients with pid are asymptomatic , while patients with more severe disease present with abdominal pain requiring surgical intervention.6,7 subclinical pid is defined as inflammation of the upper reproductive tract in the absence of signs and symptoms of acute pid.7 according to the cdc 2015 sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines , any young sexually active woman or woman at risk for stis with unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and at least one of the following clinical criteria noted on pelvic examination should receive presumptive treatment for pid : cervical motion tenderness , uterine tenderness , and adnexal tenderness ( table 1).8 in this review , we aim to discuss the current state of pid management and propose new strategies for optimal management .
