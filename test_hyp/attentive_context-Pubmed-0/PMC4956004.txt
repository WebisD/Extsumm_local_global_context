alternatively , restoring the analgesic ligand may be a new direction for targeting painful neuropathy , that is , maintenance of steady - static adenosine content and functional pap ectonucleotidase activity at the neuronal soma level .
for pain development , this study provides evidence of an alternative pathway to conventional small nociceptor sensitization - induced neuropathic pain ; the loss of analgesic effect of pap is mediated by neuronal soma irritation and/or injury .
rtx - induced neuropathy is an excellent model for determining how the loss of the analgesic effect of pap leads to injury - induced neuropathic pain . in the present study , we investigated the intervention of pap profiles to neuropathic pain and the effect of 4mc on reversing neuropathic pain through ngf - trka signaling .
some mice in the 4mc group received additional anti - ngf antisera ( 30  g / kg , sigma ) to neutralize ngf induced by 4mc ( the abngf group ) . to compare each experimental approach , 2.5s ngf and anti
pap downregulation leads to the imbalance of amp / adenosine ratios , inhibiting the analgesic effect of adenosine . taken together ,
this is the first report documenting the intervention of pap and ngf - trka signaling , which mediates neuropathic pain .
