this study demonstrates the application of an iterative two - stage multi - method strategy to improve quality of service ( ie , design - based research ) .
it represents a continuous and systematic appraisal of an operational process with the objective of improving the quality of health service .
in addition , an intervention based on the outcomes of the first survey was designed , which included increasing consultation time and carrying out structural improvements in the waiting rooms . in general
our aim was to improve the ultimate customer experience of our patients ( and their parents ) and , in particular , increase their satisfaction with our wait times and waiting environment in our clinic .
the ratio of first time to follow - up patients , however , was similar in both of the survey samples .
as our study represents the continuous appraisal of operational processes , the search for ways to reduce wait time and improve patients satisfaction with the provided care remains an area for further investigation .
in summary , our study showed that the satisfaction with wait time was high and equal , both prior to and after the intervention .
