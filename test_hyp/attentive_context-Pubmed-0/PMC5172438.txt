the lack of both high - resolution and low - resolution experimental data of mp structures makes the algorithm development and their evaluation difficult , but the fact that most mp sequences are used as space blocks to get through the membrane bilayer that has predefined thickness makes the structure prediction of mps simple on functional aspects .
the structure prediction of membrane proteins still remains an interesting scientific problem . because of the physical difference between mps and gps ( globular proteins )
membrane proteins ( mps ) constitute about 30% of all the proteins encoded in the currently known genomes , and play critical roles in cell signaling , ion transport , and cell - cell communications , as well as assist the folding of other mps ( 1 ) . because of these biological significance
consequently , estimates for prediction accuracy are perhaps overly optimistic . here , we summarize recent attempts within the field of computational biology and bioinformatics to predict an mp s structure .
most current methods of theoretical mp structure prediction do not actually deal with predicting the 3d structure , but rather try to predict the most likely topology of the protein , that is to say , the in / out location of the n and c termini relative to the membrane , and the number and position of transmembrane ( tm ) segments . a high - quality model of secondary structure and topology
