hplc in combination with automated analytical system and esi / ms / ms was employed to analyze a , ma , ha , and their benzoyl analogs in our study .
hence , ha could be used as an indicator when one alkaloid is required as a reference to monitor the quality of aconitum alkaloids , and the raw and processed chuanwu and caowu can be distinguished by monitoring the ratio of a and ma to ha .
the most important finding in this research is that the analytical results indicated that ha was the most stable compound among a , ma , and ha , even after prolonged heating treatment , and thus suggest that ha might play a major role in the toxicity of processed chuanwu and caowu .
in addition , raw and processed chuanwu and caowu can be distinguished by monitoring the ratio of a and ma to ha .
the analytical results obtained from of automated analytical system are identical to those from esi / ms / ms . therefore , the automated analytical system would be a good complementary method for the quality control of the herbal preparations containing aconite alkaloids .
in addition , we have also conducted preliminary study to identify the benzoylaconitines hydrolysed from the three alkaloids in raw and processed chuanwu and caowu , by heating a , ma , and ha in dioxin / h2o ( 7.5/2.5 , v / v ) at 120c for 50  min .
