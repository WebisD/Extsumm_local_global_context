here we report a cerebellar abscess mimicking brain tumor with atypical clinical and paraclinical presentations . a two - month
old previously well - baby boy was referred to us with persistent vomiting , strabismus and developmental regression .
the brain imaging showed a right cerebellar mass with multiple small cysts inside the lesion . elevated serum alfa - fetoprotein
associated with cystic and solid posterior fossa mass proposed the preoperative diagnosis of teratoma but tumor cells were not found inside the pathology specimen .
brain abscess in young infants is extremely rare and usually associated with a previous history of bacterial meningitis or septicemia .
the interest of this case lies in the atypical features of clinical and radiological evaluations in a young infant associated with an abnormal alfa - fetoprotein level of serum .
high afp has not been reported in abscess nevertheless and there is no reason for this high level of afp in this rare case of cerebellar abscess . to find an explanation for this association we propose evaluation of afp in young children with brain abscess .
a young infant with staphylococcus cerebellar abscess is reported which mimicked tumor due to elevated serum afp and neuroimaging .
