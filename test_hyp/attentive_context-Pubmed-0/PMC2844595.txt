fourth , the absence of the clinical or epidemiological data of the host in the previous studies does not allow assessing the impact of the host on certain vf profiles or on the phylotyping from the infection . to clarify the clinical characteristics of the ciprofloxacin resistance in patients with auc , we analyzed the vfs , the resistance phenotype and the clinical characteristics for 54 samples of ciprofloxacin resistant strains from patients with auc and 55 randomly selected ciprofloxacin sensitive strains from patients with auc in 22 korean hospitals .
, the expressions of cnf1 and papef reduced the ciprofloxacin resistance risk ( odds ratio [ or ] 0.237 , 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 0.07 - 0.79 for cnf1 ; or 0.40 , 95% ci 0.16 - 0.96 for papef ) ( table 5 ) .
the difference may be a result of different age composition and a strict guideline to exclude the complicated uti in this study . in conclusion , the ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli isolates from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis exhibit the non - b2 phylotype and a selective loss of virulence factors in korea .
the expressions of papef , cnf1 , and hlya were significantly more prevalent in the cfse than in the cfre ( p=0.007 , p=0.018 , p=0.011 , respectively ) , whereas the expression of fima , dafabc , papgiii , and sfai were not ( p=0.346 , p=1.0 , p=0.839 , p=0.514 , respectively ) ( table 2 ) . the phylotype b2 , d , a , and b1 was present in 57% , 26% , 16% , and 1% of the samples , respectively ( fig .
