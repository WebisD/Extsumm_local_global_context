. it would be helpful to minimize mortality in these patients by managing shock in a timely manner and taking the decision to amputate appropriately and promptly.3 severe head injury is known to be a major determinant of mortality in patients with multiple injuries , but other injuries also contribute to the clinical outcome.4,5 different mechanisms of injury , such as motor vehicle crashes , falls , or pedestrians being struck by a motor vehicle , impart varying degrees of force and energy transfer that may impact outcomes ; this was found to predict mortality and functional impairment independently at hospital discharge.6 acute lower extremity compartment syndrome is a devastating complication that often presents silently in critically injured patients.7 patients who underwent delayed fasciotomy had twice the rate of major amputation and a three - fold higher mortality rate.8 the aim of this study was to evaluate if injuries of the extremities are associated with a higher one - month mortality rate than other types of associated trauma .
the treatment of patients with multiple trauma requires a different approach to that of patients with regular trauma because they are threatened not only by the injuries themselves , but also by the metabolic disruptions that follow.1 delay in surgery , blunt trauma , extensive soft tissue damage , and combined orthopedic and vascular injuries have been associated with an increased risk of amputation , while associated nerve and bone injuries with extensive soft tissue damage are risk factors for a poor outcome.2 acute renal failure is the main cause of death in patients with war wounds and trauma of the extremities
