a 29-year - old woman with a three - year history of aids presented with polymorphic papules on the face and abdomen .
some clinical presentations may be puzzling , particularly in secondary syphilis exhibiting lesions showing a marked tendency to polymorphism .
a number of skin disorders have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) . among them , secondary infections are common , but their incidence has decreased considerably following the introduction of combined therapies targeted to the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) .
the skin lesions were asymptomatic but the patient complained of discrete malaise , stiff neck , myalgia headache , and mild fever . a biopsy specimen was taken from a papule on the abdomen .
in the present case , skin immunohistochemistry shed some light on the diagnosis of syphilis in an aids patient and showed the dermal homing and the microvascular tropism of t. pallidum .
the peculiar homing of t. pallidum in the skin appears quite specific as it has not been reported for any other infectious microorganism .
an immunohistochemical assessment was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to treponema pallidum ( 1:200 biocare medical , walnut creek , ca , usa ) .
