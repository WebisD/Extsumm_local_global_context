it was argued that considerations derived from a diachronic perspective are relevant to questions of treatment decision - making liberty , and are consistent with a procedural understanding of the functional element of the test .
influential liberal thinking holds that it is not the place of the law to pursue certain ends  rather , the law should aim to provide a space for individuals to pursue their own ends ( plant , 2011 )  and this position is reflected in english common law relating to mental capacity:[in assessments of capacity ] it is most important that those considering the issue should not confuse the question of mental capacity with the nature of the decision made by the patient , however grave the consequences .
the view of the patient may reflect a difference in values rather than an absence of competence and the assessment of capacity should be approached with this firmly in mind. in practice then , questions of mental capacity might be thought of as boiling down to a question about whether a decision can be explained in terms of the patient 's particular motivating commitments ( their desires , values , projects , ideas about a good life ) ; or whether the decision is properly explained in terms of a problem in decision - making , which is due to a dysfunction of mind or brain . is the patient 's controversial decision understandable in the light of their commitments ? or is the patient 's ability to understand , retain , and use or weigh what the likely costs and benefits of treatment will be for them , currently compromised ? scrutinizing a patient 's commitments in the context of a capacity assessment raises moral concerns because the possibility that a choice can be explained by idiosyncratic commitments plays a significant role in protecting the patient 's right to make controversial decisions .
