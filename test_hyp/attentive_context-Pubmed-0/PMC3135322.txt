, we study mscs inactivation with a special set of pressure protocols including preconditioning pressure steps and saturating test pulses and show that opening does not enhance , but rather excludes , inactivation .
analysis of  soft  and  stiff  mutants with different opening thresholds illustrates that the opening and inactivation are two competing transition pathways from the same closed state .
test pulses delivered from a computer - driven pressure clamp machine critically helped us to characterize the processes of adaptation , inactivation , and recovery .
tension dependencies of both inactivation and recovery rates suggest the spatial scale of the inactivating transition , which guides the modeling of the inactivated state .
the data presented above show that ( a ) wt mscs inactivates from the closed ( resting ) state , whereas opening prevents inactivation ; ( b ) inactivation , as activation , is also driven by tension and is accompanied by 8.5-nm in - plane protein expansion ; and ( c ) it appears that gain- or loss - of - function mutations that alter the position of the activation curve influence inactivation indirectly , simply by shifting the activation and inactivation curves relative to one another , thus either abolishing inactivation or producing  silent  inactivation without activation . the experiments presented in figs . 1 and 2 a illustrate that full opening of the mscs population does not increase the fraction of inactivated channels at the end of the pressure protocol .
