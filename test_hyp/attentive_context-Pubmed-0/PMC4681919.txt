assessment of neck rotation 
 movement in patients with fhp should take into consideration lateral flexion in the frontal 
 plane and contralateral scm activation .
thus , the aims of this 
 study were to compare 1 ) the rotation - lateral flexion ratio , 2 ) the lateral flexion movement 
 onset time , 3 ) the rotation and lateral flexion angles , and 4 ) the muscle activation of scm 
 between individuals with fhp and controls during neck rotation .
we hypothesized that 1 ) the 
 rotation - lateral flexion ratios would be higher , 2 ) the lateral flexion movement onset time 
 would be earlier , and 3 ) the rotation and lateral flexion angle values would be higher 
 during neck rotation in the fhp group ; we also hypothesized that 4 ) the scm muscles would be 
 more highly activated during maintenance of end - range neck rotation in both directions in 
 the fhp group than in control subjects .
