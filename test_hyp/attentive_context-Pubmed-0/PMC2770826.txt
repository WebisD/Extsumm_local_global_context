this system can be a useful diagnostic tool for examining a small field of breast cancer with a low radiation dose to the patient after conducting conventional mammography studies . to improve the small - field digital mammographic imaging system using parabolic polycapillary optics , large
therefore , to obtain a parallel beam of high photon flux , the x - ray tube should have a high capacity . in conclusion , due to its high spatial resolution and low radiation dose , a small - field digital mammographic imaging system has the potential to be used for examining local volumes of breast tissue . a relatively large field image
when the x - ray tube of 100-m - spot size without the parabolic polycapillary optics and the same ccd detector are used to make a projection - type x - ray image , we may obtain a similar spatial resolution of 12 lp / mm at a magnification of 1.48 . in the imaging system
spatial resolutions of 12 lp / mm for molybdenum and rhodium filters with a 25-m thickness were obtained using the small - field digital mammographic imaging system .
in addition , the system configuration could not avoid a high radiation dose because of long exposure time , i.e. , six seconds per one scanned image during scanning . in the scanning process , the capillary optics and the detector were combined with each other and moved together .
