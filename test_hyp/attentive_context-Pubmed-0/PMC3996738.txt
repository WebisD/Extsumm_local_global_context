the results are comparable to those of laparoscopy , robot helps to duplicate many procedures with exceptional laparoscopic skills .
27 were robotic radical hysterectomies for cancer cervix , 10 total robotic hysterectomies with bilateral salpingo - opherectomy with ilioobturator node dissection for cancer endometrium , 2 were total robotic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo- opherectomy and omentectomy for cancer ovary , 7 were exenterations , 5 were parametrectomy .
2 tubotuboplasties , 1 endometriotic cyst excision , 1 metroplasty , 1 rectovaginal fistula repair were also performed with good results at our institute . of the total of 51 oncological cases performed robotically ,
comparison of our data of total robotic hysterectomy with previously reported series our operative time , estimated blood loss was considerably lower when compared with other standard international studies .
of the total of 80 gynecological cases performed robotically in our institute , 29 were benign and 51 were malignant cases .
robotic radical hysterectomy : we have compared the results of our radical hysterectomies with those of other standard reported cases in literature . as shown in table 2 our operative time , effective blood loss was less than that of others . two cases of ureteric fistulas reported were during initial phase after acquiring the robot . as we got acquainted with these procedures
