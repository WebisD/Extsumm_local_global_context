, a small number of neurostimulation techniques for tinnitus have been the subject of either a systematic review and meta - analysis ( transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) , cochlear implantation   ) or a scoping review ( tdcs ) . here
interventions included in this review used noninvasive electrical stimulation of the ear , transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tacs ) , vagal nerve stimulation ( vns ) , transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation ( tvns ) , procedures involving direct cortical stimulation , or paired electrical and acoustic stimulation . in terms of outcomes , of interest was whether the intervention had any potential clinical effect on symptom severity , measured as the global score on a self - report measure of tinnitus , generalised anxiety , depression , or quality of life , and equally whether there were adverse effects of the intervention .
the objective was to scope the literature on approaches to electrical stimulation of the ear , head , cranial nerve , or cortex for tinnitus which are more experimental insofar as they have not yet been the subject of a scoping or systematic review .
these included three studies using noninvasive electrical stimulation of the ear ( reported 2013 - 2014 ) , two studies of transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tacs ) ( reported 2013 - 2014 ) , one pilot study and one case study using vagal nerve stimulation ( vns ) ( reported 2014 - 2015 ) , five studies using transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation ( tvns ) ( reported 20122015 ) , one study examining vestibulocochlear nerve stimulation ( reported in 2007 ) , and seven studies involving different forms of direct cortical stimulation ( reported 20042015 ) .
