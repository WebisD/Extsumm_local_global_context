current studies showed that immunosignals against 20s proteasomes and ubiquitin were present in nucleolar vacuole territories .
genes encoding subunits of the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( ups ) are present in organisms ranging from some prokaryotes to all studied eukaryotes , and appear to have been highly conserved throughout evolution , hence in the current work the antibodies to core subunits of the human 20s proteasomes and to the human ubiquitin were used to identify proteasomes and ubiquitin in the plant material . in this study the immunocytofluorescent microscopy showed nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling with the antibodies against 20s proteasomes and ubiquitin in all studied cells of soybean root meristems suggesting that both elements of the ups were present in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm . in other eukaryotes both components of the ups are also found in the cytoplasm and within the nucleus .
moreover , in the nucleoli of plants subjected to recovery after chilling stress transcriptional activity and transport of ribosomal subunits to the cytoplasm were even more intensive than in the control and then characteristic , single , huge , and centrally located nucleolar vacuoles appeared in them .
that is why the presence of ubiquitin in a nucleolus does not necessarily mean that degradation of ubiquitinated proteins takes place in a nucleolus , however it may indicate that nucleoli , precisely the nucleolar vacuoles , may not merely be useless empty space formed in active nucleoli as a consequence of intensive transport of pre - ribosomal particles out of the nucleoli , but they could be the site of temporary sequestration or storage of the ups components or ubiquitin conjugates as well as other biochemical cellular components in plant cells , similarly as different discrete , focal regions in animal nucleoli are used as storage compartments for certain enzymatic and regulatory proteins , which can be released in a regulated manner to exert their function elsewhere .
