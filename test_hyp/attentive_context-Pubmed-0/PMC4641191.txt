given the critical role of the pi3k / akt / mtor signaling pathway in cancer biology and the immunostimulatory effect of pi3k / akt / mtor inhibitors on dc - tumor hybrids , combination therapy may represent a promising and novel cancer vaccine with enhanced clinical impact .
the pi3k / akt / mtor pathway has been shown to play a critical role in cell proliferation , survival , and metastasis of cancer cells , and we observed that inhibition of the pi3k / akt and inhibition of the mtor pathway enhanced the immune - stimulatory capacity of dc - tumor fusions through induction of bioactive il-12p70 secretion .
the fact that combined inhibition of pi3k and mtor signaling did not further improve il-12p70 secretion by dc - tumor fusions may indicate that inhibition acted on the same signaling pathway , likely to involve p70 as has been described previously . in sum , we conclude that combining pi3k / akt / mtor inhibition with dc - melanoma fusion cell - based cancer vaccination appears to be a promising strategy and warrants further studies in vitro and in animal models .
in contrast , il-12 production could significantly be enhanced by treatment of dc - tumor hybrids with inhibitors of the pi3k and mtor .
