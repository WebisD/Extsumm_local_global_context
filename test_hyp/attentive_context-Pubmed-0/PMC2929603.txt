another aim of this paper was to evaluate these three common pcr approaches for detecting b. adolescentis and a single - step pcr approach for detecting hubac as indicators of human fecal pollution in environmental samples .
the discrepancies observed in this paper compared to other papers on the detection of b. adolescentis as a putative marker of human fecal pollution were attributed to differences in the methods of dna extraction from environmental samples and differences in the pcr protocol used ( e.g. , primer sets and nested pcr ) .  
detection of b. adolescentis as a marker of human fecal bacteria in sewage samples with a single pcr   showed positive bands in only 2 out of 3 raw sewage samples and was ineffective with diluted sewage samples ( table 3 ) . to increase the sensitivity of detecting b. adolescentis   in fecal samples ,   bonjoch et al .   developed a nested pcr assay for b. adolescentis
the general good agreement of bacteriodales and b. adolescentis detection from field samples suggests that both methods are suitable for detection of fecal contamination in the environments examined .
   molecular source tracking methods are very useful for identifying the source of fecal pollution in environmental samples , however , attention should be placed on choosing the most appropriate pcr procedure and molecular marker in order to avoid misleading results .   the reliable detection of b. adolescentis in environmental samples by conventional pcr ( nonquantitative pcr ) as an indicator of human fecal pollution requires multiplexing .
