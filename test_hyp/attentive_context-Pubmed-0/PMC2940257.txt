we report a patient with a left inferior capsular genu infarction who developed abulia and increased writing activity , similar to automatic writing behavior .
, we suggest that malfunction of the frontal - subcortical circuit , due to an inferior capsular genu infarction , contributed to the development of motor perseveration in writing .
this is the first report of an increased writing activity , together with perseverative writing , that was related to a capsular genu infarction .
increased writing activity is seldom seen in neurological conditions , except in some patients with cerebrovascular disease , frontal - type dementia , temporal lobe epilepsy , and parkinson 's disease .
the patient was a 79-year - old , right - handed woman who could independently perform daily living activities , including cooking , washing , and cleaning .
this may then cause the characteristic writing behavior , since leukoaraiosis has been associated with subtle cognitive impairment . in conclusion
brain magnetic resonance images ( mri ) revealed ischemic lesions involving the inferior genu of the left internal capsule , a part of the internal segment of the globus pallidus , and subcortical white matter with mild cortical atrophy ( fig .
