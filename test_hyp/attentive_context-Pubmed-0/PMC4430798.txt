we report an atypical case of appendiceal abscess , which was diagnosed during colonoscopy . 


 a 30-year - old man referred for evaluation to our center with epigastric pain from three days prior to his evaluation .

 acute appendicitis is considered as the most frequent cause of acute abdomen in young patients with a slight predominance in males .
this unusual case highlights a patient with an appendiceal abscess diagnosed by colonoscopy . because of spontaneous drainage of abscess into the lumen of colon and antibiotic therapy ,
using colonoscopy for the diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic acute appendicitis and appendiceal abscess are rare . in unusual appendicitis cases , especially in the presence of abdominal comorbidities , colonoscopy is used ; although colonoscopy is not considered as the first line intervention because of complications risk such as bleeding or perforation . furthermore non - invasive tests such as ultrasonography and computed tomography with more sensitivity can be used .
petro m reported a case of the earliest stage of acute appendicitis in an asymptomatic patient undergoing colonoscopy for evaluation of colorectal cancer . 
 

although its clinical diagnosis is simple , 20 - 30% of appendicitis cases are reported to be gangrenous or perforated because of delayed diagnosis , which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality .
