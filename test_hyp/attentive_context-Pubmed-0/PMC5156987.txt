phyllodes tumor ( pt ) is a rare fibroepithelial neoplasm accounting for less than 1% of all breast tumors .
occasionally , only epithelial components of pt is represented in smears and may be misdiagnosed as epithelial neoplasm , particularly tubular adenoma and carcinoma . here , we present a case of bpt diagnosed by excisional biopsy , but its fnac features were misleading due to predominance of the epithelial component showing a tubular adenoma - like pattern .
diagnostic pitfalls of pt in fine - needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) may be due to sampling error , high cellularity , ductal hyperplasia , paucity of stromal component , and occasional dissociation of epithelial cells .
we conclude that if there is significant epithelial proliferation in bpt , a false diagnosis of epithelial neoplasm in fnac is possible and it is an important diagnostic pitfall .
a 19-year - old female presented with an ill - defined mass in the left breast about ( 2.5  2 ) cm above the areola in the breast tissue .
benign pt ( bpt ) has hypercellular stromal fragments organized in leaflike patterns around benign epithelial / myoepithelial lined spaces .
this will help in correct planning of surgical treatment , i.e. , wide excision with 1 cm margin .
