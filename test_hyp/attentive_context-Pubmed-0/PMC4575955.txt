we report a case of a gastric volvulus in a patient with a history of a diaphragmatic hernia .
an emergent laparoscopic diaphragmatic hernia mesh repair and gastropexy was performed , resulting in a complete recovery .
gastric volvulus is characterized by a rotation of the stomach along its axis in variable degrees and may present either acutely or chronically .
the laparoscopic approach is defined by the need to de - rotate and reduce the gastric contents into the abdominal cavity .
it may cause a complete gastric outlet obstruction and strangulation , leading to ischemic necrosis and perforation with a mortality rate of 3050% .
primary gastric volvulus results from abnormalities of the four gastric ligaments that restrict rotation : gastrocolic , gastrophrenic , gastrosplenic and hepatogastric .
a 49-year - old woman presented to our emergency department with a 2-week history of epigastric pain and vomiting with no prior trauma . her past medical history included hypertension , iron deficiency anemia , laparoscopic cholecystectomy and an open uterine myomectomy .
a detailed history of the risk factors associated with gastric volvulus including previous surgical procedures , gastro - oesophageal reflux disease or history of trauma should be obtained .
