this audit showed that there is a clear under - utilisation of adt and particularly chemotherapeutic agents in nz men with advanced prostate cancer . particularly in men with distant metastases
the aim of this study was to ascertain the patterns of dispensing adt , including anti - androgens and luteinising hormone - releasing hormone ( lhrh ) analogues , and chemotherapeutic agents in new zealand men within the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis .
the aim of this study was to assess the frequency of use of adt and chemotherapeutic agents for nz men in the first year after cancer diagnosis , particularly for metastatic patients for whom adt should be prescribed immediately.9 therefore , we have not followed up the cohort for a longer period of time .
multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of age at diagnosis , ethnicity , year of diagnosis , and orchidectomy on the use of adt ( anti - androgens and lhrh analogues alone or combined ) in men with advanced cancer at diagnosis .
the stage and grade of cancer will obviously influence treatment options , as will the presence of various co - morbidities.4 men with metastatic prostate cancer may be offered pharmacologic androgen deprivation therapy ( adt ) , specific chemotherapeutic medication or be treated with orchidectomy.5 in new zealand , mori men are less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer but have a 70% increased risk of dying compared with non - mori men.6 moreover , mori men diagnosed with non - localised prostate cancer have a threefold risk of dying from the disease compared with non - mori men.7 variation in treatment may be one of the reasons for the observed survival disparities . in the uk , increased use of adt has been linked to the trend of decreasing mortality.8 it is possible that variation in the use of adt also contributes to the survival differences between mori and non - mori men with non - localised prostate cancer . however , little information is available on the use of adt and chemotherapeutic agents in prostate cancer patients in new zealand .
