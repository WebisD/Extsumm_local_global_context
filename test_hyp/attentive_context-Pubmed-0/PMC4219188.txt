since the clinical outcomes and complications after alif for postoperative spondylodiscitis are also poorly understood , we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes and complications of patients who received alif for the treatment of postoperative spondylodiscitis in this study .
alif has many benefits over the posterior approach , including lessening damage to the paraspinal structures , providing a wider fusion bed for better arthrodesis , and more effective restoration of the vertebral balance .
the mean interval from the primary surgery to alif was 7.8 months ( 1 - 23 months ) , and the average duration of symptoms before alif was 2.1 months ( 1 - 5 months ) .
the mean interval from the primary surgery to postoperative spondylodiscitis was 5.8 months ( 1 - 22 months ) .
from january , 1994 to august , 2013 , 13251 patients received spinal surgeries at our institute . among them , 82 ( 0.62% ) suffered postoperative spondylodiscitis , and alif was done in 13 patients .
this patient was treated with combination of vancomycin and amphotericin b. in the laboratory findings , the initial average erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) level was 42.228.8 mm / h ( 0 - 15 mm / h ) , c - reactive protein ( crp ) level was 61.169.4 mg / l ( 0 - 5.3
