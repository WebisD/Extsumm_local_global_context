a fit and healthy 25-year - old male presented with palpitations from a regular broad complex tachycardia ( bct ) of left bundle branch block ( lbbb)-like morphology , 330-ms cycle length , and no discernible  p waves .
furthermore , the m potentials , as recorded from the distal mini - electrodes , were clearer and of higher amplitude compared with those recorded using the conventional distal pole of the ablation catheter
. we did not compare this with a standard ablation catheter in the same patient to keep the costs of the procedure within reasonable limits and to avoid causing unintentional mechanical trauma to the atrial insertion site .
they usually only conduct in an anterograde manner , participating in the anterograde limb of an antidromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia ( avrt ) with lbbb - like morphology and decremental properties .
we used the same principle in this case to make use of the special characteristics of the novel ablation catheter to localize the atrial insertion point accurately .
standard therapy involves targeted rfa around the tricuspid annulus as guided by pathway potentials also known as mahaim ( m ) potentials , .
the intellatip mifi catheter has been shown to delineate local electograms better in the isthmus than the conventional bipolar electrode during atrial flutter ablation .
