we report here the 5th case of isolated cavernous hemangioma that was limited to the tympanic membrane and we review the relevant literature .
a 49-year - old man patient was referred to our department for evaluation of right - sided pulsatile tinnitus that he had experienced for the previous 2 years .
however their incidence in the tympanic membrane is very rare and there have been only 4 such case reports in the literature according to a medline search from 1970 to 2008 ( 9 - 12 ) .
cavernous hemangioma of the external auditory canal ( eac ) and tympanic membrane is rare , but this lesion is more common in the eac . according to the previously reported cases ( 2 - 8 ) , cavernous hemangioma seems to most frequently arise in the posterior portion of the eac .
in 1983 , andrade et al . ( 10 ) reported the first case of cavernous hemangioma limited to the tympanic membrane in a 59-year - old man with a contralateral ear infection . according to the previously reported cases , cavernous hemangioma seems to most frequently arise in the posterior portion of the eac .
hemangiomas are common lesions of the head and neck area , and they predominantly originate from the lips , tongue and buccal mucosa .
