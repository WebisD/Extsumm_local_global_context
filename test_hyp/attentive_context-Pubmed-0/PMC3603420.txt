the purpose of the study , therefore , was to examine the association between participation in organized sports and physical fitness as well as overweight in 8-year - old children while considering various environmental constraints .
even though directionality of these relationships can not be established , these results emphasize the necessity for an early establishment of an active lifestyle , including sports participation , to allow for the development of various components associated with physical fitness as this may facilitate long - term engagement in sports and physical activity . considering the low levels of physical education in school with the continued risk of further reduction
  overall , the present study shows that increased participation in organized sports is associated with increased physical fitness and lower risk for overweight in elementary school children .
the majority of children ( 60% ) participated in sports once or twice per week beyond the recommended 3 classes of pe .
bmipct differed significantly between sports participation groups ( f ( 2 , 1004 ) = 6.81 , p < 0.01 ) . specifically , those reporting sports participation 1 - 2 times per week had significantly lower bmipct than those reporting less than once a week .
