the most characteristic finding on mri is a downward extrusion of the tumor through the foramen of magendie into the cervical subarachnoid cervical space or through the foramen of luschka into the cerebellopontine cistern.3 
 4 this presentation highlights the requirement for close follow - up of grade ii ependymomas for anaplastic transformation .
ataxia , dizziness , hemiparesis , and visual disturbance may add to the clinical picture.1

  the current imaging protocol for the diagnosis is magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
postoperative irradiation is not recommended in the treatment of grade ii ependymomas for children  <  3 years of age .
an infratentorial brain tumor in the median and right cerebellar area was found on contrast mri .
ependymomas are relatively rare neuroepithelial tumors and account for 3 to 7% of all central nervous system tumors .
the correct grading of intracranial ependymomas may be difficult for the anaplastic variant because the common criteria for anaplasia are not completely reliable for all cases.13 
 22 ependymomas in young infants have a worse prognosis than older children , so we need a grading scheme with a proven general ability to distinguish grades and to predict the evolution of individual cases.23 also new radiation therapy techniques and chemotherapeutic agents need to be developed .
