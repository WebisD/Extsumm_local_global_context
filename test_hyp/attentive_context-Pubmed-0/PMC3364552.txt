while there has been little attention paid to kidney disease on a public health level , the reality is that many countries hardly bear the costs of providing end - stage renal disease care through renal replacement therapy . according to the latest usrds report ,
aberrant proliferation of mesangial cells is a common finding in a number of diseases that can lead to end - stage renal failure .
however , serious side effects including renal injury and proteinuria have been described during treatment with these drugs , in the setting of renal allograft nephropathy , human glomerulonephritis as well as in experimental kidney disease   . despite this , mtor inhibition has been shown to be beneficial in chronic mesangioproliferative nephropathy and to reduce proteinuria in an experimental anti - thy1 nephritis ( a chronic model of progressive mesangioproliferative nephropathy ) and in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis .  
mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis , mostly iga nephropathy , is the most frequent primary glomerular disorder worldwide , and progressive mesangioproliferative nephropathy constitutes a major cause of end - stage renal disease   .
the clinical efficacy of new immunosuppressors is increasingly assessed   . among these , the mammalian target of the rapamycin ( mtor ) inhibitor family , which includes sirolimus and everolimus , is frequently used immunosuppressant with proliferation signal inhibitors properties employed in nephrology   .
