while supraclavicular fossa recurrences are rare after breast conservation therapy , our data suggest that in patients with 4 or more positive axillary nodes treated with traditional tangential / supraclavicular techniques , high nodal ratios ( > 70% ) predict for in - field regional recurrences .
the purpose of our study was to determine if , in the high - risk patient population who have undergone adequate axillary dissection , nodal ratios can help identify a subgroup of patients that are at highest risk for nodal in - field recurrences so that radiation treatment modifications can potentially be made to improve regional relapse rates in this high - risk population .
while these findings need to be reproduced in larger datasets , more meticulous treatment planning of regional nodes , radiation dose escalation , and/or more intensive systemic therapies in high nodal ratio patients should be considered .
the present study cohort consisted of a group of high - risk , early - stage , invasive breast cancer patients who had a minimum of 8 lymph nodes excised with breast - conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy ( n = 1060 ) . of this group ,
the nodal ratio was predictive of nodal relapse free survival ( 77% in the hnr group versus 100% in the lnr and inr groups ( p < .05 ) .
