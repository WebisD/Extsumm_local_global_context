, we measured oviposition and predation on broad mites in the laboratory and tested the ability of a. swirskii to control broad mites on pepper plants in a greenhouse .
we studied the ability of a generalist predatory mite to control broad mites on sweet pepper plants .
if , for example , a. swirskii has a strong preference for feeding on whiteflies over broad mites , this could lead to temporarily reduced predation in the presence of whiteflies , but at the same time to reduced dispersal of broad mites through phoresy on whiteflies .
our results demonstrate the potential of amblyseius swirskii to control broad mites on sweet pepper plants
currently , a. swirskii is widely used to control thrips and whiteflies ( vector of broad mites ) in sweet pepper crops , also in south - eastern spain . in order to establish the suitability of a. swirskii to control broad mites
although the predators produced fewer eggs per day when offered a diet of broad mites compared to a diet of pollen , they successfully controlled broad mites on greenhouse - grown sweet pepper plants with an initial predator : prey ratio of 1:20 ( fewer than 4 broad mites per plant after 3  weeks ) . although the oviposition of a. swirskii on a diet of broad mites is not as high as on other arthropods food sources , such as thrips larvae or whitefly eggs ( messelink et al .
