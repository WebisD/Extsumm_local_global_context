in addition , he stated that relative humidity is a key factor in spore dispersion ; for example , colonized spores are high in number after rain or fog . in some cases ,
thus , we estimated that the difference in intensity of the wind resulted in the differences in spore dispersion .
three fruiting bodies of t. matsutake were used to measure the number of spores produced from each fruiting body .
the number of spores increased with time but rapidly dropped as the pileus turned over ( on the fifth day ) ; 475 spores / cm on the first day , 497 spores / cm on the second day , 599 spores / cm on the third day and 836 spores / cm on the fourth day after the veils of pileus opened . ogawa   noted that the most abundant time for spore production is 3~4 days after the veil of pileus is torn down .
the samples used for the enumeration of spores were similar in size used for the investigation of spore dispersion , and their veils under each pileus had just started to open .
a spore print was formed on the surface of litter , which indicates that the spores were not widely spread out .
