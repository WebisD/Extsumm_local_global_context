, the pill stop is required in the competitive inhibition state to prevent l - dopa overdose and facilitate realization of the therapeutic dosing value .
it has been previously documented how depletions of serotonin , l - tyrosine , and thiols are associated with parkinson s disease and potentiated by l - dopa monotherapy with or without a general decarboxylase inhibitor in the endogenous state .
l - dopa daily dosing values that are either excessive or insufficient relative to the optimal therapeutic requirements are clinically associated with the exact same symptoms of parkinson s disease , each with identical intensity .
these novel findings document that there are no clinical signs or symptoms for the physician to formulate a conclusion that the patient is overdosed on l - dopa and is above the optimal therapeutic dosing range . from a safety standpoint
5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-htp ) is a metabolite of l - tryptophan and the immediate precursor of serotonin .
this paper reports a novel observation relating to l - dopa in the competitive inhibition state .
the depletions of serotonin , thiols , l - tyrosine , l - tryptophan , and other monoamines associated with the clinical course of parkinson s disease , l - dopa monotherapy , and the use of general decarboxylase inhibitors are not addressed ( see table 2).2,12 under the current standard of care , the etiology of the signs and symptoms associated with these depletions is not adequately recognized , understood , or controlled .
