concordance between das28 values using crp and esr in ra patients with ss and the control group the objective of the study was to find a relationship between higher esr and hypergammaglobulinemia in patients with ra and sss .
differences in esr and crp values in groups of patients with ra and sss , dysproteinaemia and hypergammaglobulinemia ; all values are median and iqr  interquartile range
1 ) in the first group of patients with ra and sss . in the control group
it should be noted that in patients with ra and sss , the mean value of esr was 39 mm / hr , whereas of crp , 25 mg / l . on the contrary in ra patients
the aim of this study is to evaluate whether the difference in the values of the das28 calculated taking into account diverse parameters of inflammatory activity ( esr or crp ) is clinically relevant . in case
this study evaluating 60 patients with ra with sss revealed that values of das28-crp are significantly lower than those of das28-esr .
one group comprised 60 patients with ra and sss , second  the control group  patients with ra alone . in the patients with ra and sss group ,
