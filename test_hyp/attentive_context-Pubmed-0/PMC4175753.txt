the results indicate that 6 weeks of submaximal eccentric training attenuate several intermediates related to the nf-b and ap-1 activation and , consequently , the proinflammatory response detected after an acute bout of eccentric exercise .
this response was associated with a downregulation of the tlr4 signaling through both myd88-dependent and independent pathways .
first , we aimed to describe the regulation of nf-b , irf3 , and indirectly ap-1 through tlr4 signaling pathway activation in pbmc in response to an acute bout of eccentric exercise in young female subjects . considering that tlr4 signaling was upregulated in men after a similar bout of exercise
additionally , the eccentric training is purported to be a valuable tool to decrease exercise - induced inflammation through a downregulation of the tlr4 downstream signaling in young women .
it was hypothesized that the activation of the different tlr4 signaling pathways , for example , nf-b , ap-1 , and irf3 , in response to an acute eccentric bout would be reduced after the eccentric training period .
therefore , these data provide further support for a training - induced downregulation of tlr4 and its coreceptor cd14 at protein level . confirming previous results in young men
