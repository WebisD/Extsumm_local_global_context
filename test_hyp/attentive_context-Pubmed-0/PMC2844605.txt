we performed sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery using intercostal nerve in 19 patients with severe compensatory hyperhidrosis after endoscopic thoracic sympathetic surgery and evaluated the results of the procedure .
from february 2004 to august 2007 , we performed endoscopic thoracic sympathetic surgery in 184 patients with primary hyperhidrosis . among theses
patients , reconstruction surgery of sympathetic nerve using intercostal nerve was performed in 19 patients with severe compensatory hyperhidrosis after endoscopic thoracic sympathetic surgery .
, our results suggest that sympathetic nerve reconstruction with intercostal nerve may be one of the useful surgical methods in severe compensatory hyperhidrosis patients .
the reconstruction surgery must be decided very carefully in highly selected patients with severe compensatory hyperhidrosis .
postoperative complications of the reconstruction surgery were seen in 5 patients ; prolonged chest wall pain which was tolerable in 2 patients , and numbness of chest wall in 2 patients .
after the reconstruction surgery , trunk temperature has increased , and this result corresponded with patient 's symptom . even though the number of patients is not sufficient for data analysis , outcome of the reconstruction surgery did not correlate with the interval between the sympathetic surgery and reconstructive surgery . to evaluate the exact effects of sympathetic nerve reconstruction , more cases and longer
