complexation of l1l3 with ruthenium or osmium yielded compounds with increased solubility in the biological medium , yet lowered antiproliferative activity in human cancer cell lines .
nevertheless , the lack of pronounced effects on the cell cycle of chemosensitive ovarian cancer cells argues against a major role for inhibition of cell growth , at least in this setting .
the known cdk - inhibitory activity of the ligands could be confirmed in cell - free experiments , in particular in cdk2/cyclin e , and their stronger effects on cdk activity parallel their higher capacity of inhibiting cancer cell growth in vitro , compared to their metal complexes .
although the lack of generally pronounced cell cycle effects does not argue for a strong role of cdk inhibition in the mechanism of action of the investigated compounds , inhibitory potencies were studied in cell - free experiments with two recombinant cdk / cyclin complexes , by means of the histone h1 kinase assay .
herein , we report ( i ) the modified synthetic approach to 3-(1h - benzimidazol-2-yl)-1h - pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines ( recall chart 1 : l1 , x = h , y = h ; l2 , x = br ; y = h ; l3 , x = br ; y = ch2och3 ) ; ( ii ) the synthesis and characterization of a new family of organoruthenium(ii ) ( 11a , 12a , 13a ) and osmium(ii ) ( 11b , 12b , 13b ) complexes of the general formula [ mcl(-p - cymene)l]cl , where l = 3-(1h - benzimidazol-2-yl)-1h - pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines ( l1l3 ) ( chart 1 ) ; ( iii ) stabilization of the 7b tautomer of methoxymethyl - substituted l3 by metal coordination as well as ( iv ) nmr spectroscopic characterization of two tautomers 7b - l3 and 4b-l3 in a metal - free state ; and ( v ) cell cycle effects , as well as the antiproliferative and cdk inhibitory activities of both metal - free ligands and organometallic complexes .
