results in this large elderly cohort with long followup showing a decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality with several lifestyle practices suggest that maintenance of these is an important health promoter in aging populations .
although these lifestyle practices have substantial health benefits and reduce mortality , few studies have examined their impact in combination and on survival beyond age 75 . as part of a prospective cohort study of the effect of modifiable lifestyle practices on longevity and successful aging , we explored the association of smoking , alcohol consumption , caffeine intake , physical activity , and body mass index on cvd mortality in a large cohort ( over 13,000 ) of elderly ( median age 74 years ) men and women followed for 26 years .
alcohol intake showed a small beneficial effect ( 15% reduction in risk ) in both men and women , while a shallow u - shaped association of caffeine intake with mortality was observed in both sexes .
current smokers had significantly increased ( about 40130% ) risk compared with never smokers in all age - sex groups . in women , alcohol consumption ( <3  drinks / day )
each of these was associated with reduced cvd death in our elderly men and women , even those aged 80 years and older .
