guidewire fractures are very rare with an incidence of approximately from 0.1% to 0.2% of cases.1)2 ) although remnant guidewires can lead to life - threatening complications,3)4 ) and recently , percutaneous retrieval techniques are considered good therapeutic options , there have been several reports on the remnants being left in coronary artery and aorta without any serious adverse outcomes.5)6 ) we describe the case of fatal subacute stent thrombosis caused by guidewire fractures with retained remnant eleven days after the index procedure .
a 72-year - old woman was referred from another hospital for coronary intervention of distal left main disease .
although advances in percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) have dramatically improved the outcomes of ischemic heart disease , procedure - related complications such as device fractures or dislodgements are also increased .
, we conclude that fractured guidewire is one of the most dangerous complications of pci . in similar cases , there are fears that the remnants within a coronary stent could result in stent thrombosis . if removal of such materials percutaneously is impossible , early surgical interventions should be considered .
leaving the guidewire remnants within the left coronary artery and ascending aorta did not cause any serious complications during several months of follow - up period.5)6 ) conservative treatments are preferred when risks of interventional techniques or surgery outweigh its benefits in particular to patients who remain asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.6 ) in our case , we have tried many ways from using snares to endoscopic biopsy forceps in order to remove the remnant wires . despite all our efforts , upon closing of the procedure , we could remove only a part of the remnant in the ascending aorta .
