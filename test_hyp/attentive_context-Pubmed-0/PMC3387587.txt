in the previous issue of critical care , chou and colleagues   report that early initiation of renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) , as defined by rifle criteria , was not associated with reduction in hospital mortality in patients with acute kidney injury ( aki ) and sepsis .
in contrast , with current practice , it seems unlikely that serum creatinine or another serum / urine - based biomarker will be one of those criteria .
a recently published systematic review and meta - analysis on this topic concluded that earlier initiation of rrt in critically ill aki patients may have a beneficial impact on survival but that , in the absence of new evidence from suitably designed randomized trials , a definitive treatment recommendation can not be made . the idea that ' earlier ' initiation of treatment should be beneficial stems from our belief that sometimes complex interventions may change the course of a disease . in the case of aki and sepsis
both literature data and the currently published study once more confirm that patients with sepsis die with aki rather than of aki : no single indicator of renal function or kidney injury was predictive of mortality in the multivariate model as it was applied by chou and colleagues . in the patient group with septic aki
