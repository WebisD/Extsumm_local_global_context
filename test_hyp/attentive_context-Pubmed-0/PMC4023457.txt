schizophrenia is a heterogeneous syndrome and immune changes may be another neuropathogenic mechanism among many already described .
cognition is one of the main compromised domains in schizophrenia and accounts for a great part of the patient s functioning and quality of life .
we focused on studies that assessed cognitive and immune variables directly on the patients . by excluding studies that used other populations ( e.g. alzheimer , bipolar disorder ) or basic research we tried to reduce complexity , homogenize results and to emphasize on studies with direct clinical implications
given the relevance of the cognitive impairment and the immune changes in schizophrenia as well as the putative role of the immune system in cognitive dysfunction , it turns relevant to investigate the association between cognitive and immune variables in schizophrenia .
clinical trials have shown improvement on cognitive parameters and other symptoms with the addition of immunomodulatory drugs .
patients with schizophrenia present major impairment in social functioning , independent living and work status , compared to healthy subjects   . besides the well - established positive and negative symptoms , recently it has been largely recognized that a generalized cognitive deficit is at the core of schizophrenia , and it significantly affects patient 's social functioning [ 2 - 5 ] . cognitive impairment in schizophrenia ranges from sensory and perceptual dysfunctions to higher order cognitive dysfunctions like working and episodic memory , attention , problem solving , processing speed [ 6 - 8 ] .
