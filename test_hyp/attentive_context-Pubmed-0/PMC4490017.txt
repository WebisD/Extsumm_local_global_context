the ability to capture ctc - clusters at relatively high frequency in patients with metastatic cancer and to release them for biological studies will enable detailed analyses of the physiological role of these clusters in the progression and metastasis of human cancer .
we introduce a novel microfluidic technology that specifically isolates ctc - clusters from unprocessed blood samples of patients with cancer .
high - speed fluorescence imaging of minimally enriched blood samples are efficient for ctc - cluster detection but the low purity complicates downstream molecular analysis .
the fact that such tissue - derived macrophages travel with ctc - clusters in the bloodstream has implications for the ability to noninvasively monitor tumor - immune cell interactions , a potentially important benefit , given the increasing use of immune checkpoint blockade in the treatment of multiple different types of cancer .
occasionally , ctc - clusters are also found associated with cells of the immune system , and our rna sequencing data revealed that these are most likely tumor - associated macrophages .
the cluster - chip is purposely designed to also capture two - cell clusters because , our analysis shows ~92% of ctc - clusters are of oligoclonal nature , including the majority of two - cell clusters , and characterized by an elevated metastatic potential compared to single ctcs .
