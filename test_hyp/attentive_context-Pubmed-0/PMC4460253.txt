in multivariable regression , a positive association was also observed between total plasma sfa and crp (  = 0.24 ; 95% ci : 0.08 to 0.40 , p = 0.003 ) and between sfa and triglyceride concentrations (  = 0.08 ; 95% ci : 0.03 to 0.12 , p < 0.01 ) .
because fish intake in much of zambia is relatively low , we hypothesized that dietary intake of long - chain pufa may be inadequate in hiv - infected adults and could influence markers of cvd risk and hiv disease progression . in this study , we sought to determine whether 24-hr dietary recalls ( dr ) conducted in an urban art clinic setting in zambia could be used to effectively estimate pufa intake and whether pufa and saturated fatty acids ( sfa ) measured in plasma are associated with markers of cardiovascular disease risk .
total plasma pufa concentrations were not significantly associated with crp on a log scale (  = 0.10 ; 95% ci : 0.22 to 0.02 , p = 0.09 ) in analyses adjusting for age , sex , bmi , mufa , trans fatty acids , current smoking , and alcohol status ( data not shown ) . a positive , though weak , association was observed between total plasma pufa and triglycerides on a log scale (  = 0.03 ; 95% ci : 0.002 to 0.06 , p = 0.04 ) .
