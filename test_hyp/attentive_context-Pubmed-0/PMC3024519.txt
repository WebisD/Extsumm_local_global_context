a similar course of degradation changes of muscle proteins for the compared genotypes at simultaneous significant differences in mhc polymorphism may indicate that this polymorphism associated with the impact of the capn1s gene was a decisive factor which determined meat tenderness .
the recorded drop in proportions of the first group of proteins could have been associated with troponin t and gapdh degradation , whereas the increase in the second band  with titin degradation and appearance of products of its decomposition .
statistically significant impact was observed of the capn1s gene on meat tenderness of young slaughter cattle .
meat tenderness improvement was associated with a significant decrease in the proportions of about 37  kda m.w .
heterozygote of the capn1s gene was characterised by the highest share of the type 2a mhc isoform and the lowest of the type 1 .
this could indicate that the process of titin degradation in the meat of the examined bulls was relatively well advanced and its total proportion determined on the basis of the entire band comprising titin t1 and t2 ranged from 8 to 9%.table  1share of selected proteins in bovine lt&l muscle depending on genotype of -calpain ( capn1s ) and storage time in chilled room ( % ) genotypes mboiinmolecular weight of proteins ( kda ) and storage time of meat ( 45  min , 48 , 96 and 240  h)37002400200103approx .
