these biological effects of the endothelium are mediated by one or more of the molecules that it secretes such as prostacyclin ( pgi2 ) , thromboxane a2 ( txa2 ) , thrombomodulin ( tm ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tpa ) , von willebrand factor ( vwf ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( pai-1 ) , cd39 , angiotensin type 2 ( at2 ) , adenosine , endothelin ( et ) , and nitric oxide ( no ) . among these bioactive molecules , no is likely the most studied molecule in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system including its role in vascular tone regulation , angiogenesis and cell proliferation , inflammatory and immune response , blood clotting , and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism .
physiologically , the ecs are involved in the maintenance of vascular structure and function including formation of physical barrier between blood elements and vessel wall , as well as biological regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation , adhesion of inflammatory cells to vessel wall , vascular tone , inflammation , thrombosis , and vascular remodeling .
despite the promising efficacy of the glitazones ( tzds ) in improving insulin sensitivity and management of type 2 diabetes , the serious concern over their cardiovascular safety has urged many countries to remove all approved tzds from the market . in addition , prescription of other antidiabetic drugs such as the sulfonylurea class is increasingly limited due to incidences of associated cardiovascular risk .
