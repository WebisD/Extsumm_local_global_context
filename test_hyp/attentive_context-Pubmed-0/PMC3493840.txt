a 35-year - old female patient presented to our medical outpatient department with complaints of palpitation and chest pain of 6 months duration .
primary amenorrhea is usually the result of a genetic or anatomic abnormality . in young women with primary amenorrhea ,
perrault syndrome is a rare cause of primary amenorrhea or ovarian dysgenesis , but should be considered in a female child with deafness / mutism .
it is commonly caused by x - chromosome aberrations such as in turner syndrome , but individuals with a normal chromosome complement and ovarian dysgenesis also exist .
hypothesized that there is a form of ovarian dysgenesis that is inherited as an autosomal recessive , female - limited disorder .
perrault and his colleagues in 1951 published the first report on two sisters with gonadal dysgenesis and with additional sensorineural deafness .
the marfanoid features could be considered as a part of extended phenotype of perrault syndrome .
reported on two sporadic and two familial new cases with sensorineural hearing impairment and ovarian dysgenesis , which are the cardinal signs of perrault syndrome in females .
several reported cases have some form of neurologic deficit but our patient did not have any obvious neurological signs or symptoms , but she had marfanoid habitus , an association that was described only once in the literature .
