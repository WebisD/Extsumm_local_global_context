in the present clinical trial , the clinical success rate of ethanol wet bonding technique was compared to a three - step etch and rinse bonding system ( optibond fl , kerr , usa ) and a two - step self - etch bonding system ( clearfil se bond , kuraray , japan ) in recalls of 24 h , 6 , 9 and 12 months .
the difference between the three bonding methods was not statistically significant ; therefore , ethanol wet bonding presented equal performance to the optibond fl and clearfil se bond adhesives after 12 months of clinical functioning .
they also evaluated the success rate of clearfil se bond over eight years and showed 97% success rate . since the ethanol wet bonding technique has not been compared with other bonding methods clinically , the present study aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical success rate of ethanol wet bonding technique with a three step etch and rinse gold standard adhesive ( optibond fl ) and a two step self - etch gold standard adhesive ( clearfil se bond ) in one year clinical service .
the lesions were observed from lateral , and the cavities were classified into four groups according to the angle of the cavity ( < 45 , 4590 , 90135 , > 135 ) .
