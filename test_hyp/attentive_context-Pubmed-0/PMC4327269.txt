 ciprofloxacin associated with polyethylene glycol was the most effective combination for reducing the tested bacteria and yeasts .
analysis of the results obtained by the application of the experimental model allowed the following conclusions :  ciprofloxacin showed antimicrobial action against all tested microbial strains , and its association with metronidazole was synergic . 
the purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial action of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and metronidazole , and the vehicles polyethylene glycol and natrosol , either alone or associated , supported by the fact that intracanal medication is an important adjuvant of the endodontic treatment protocol .
twenty - three microbial strains were selected from the american type culture collection ( atcc ) and the university of taubat culture collection ( ccut ) ( table 1 ) . the susceptibility of the microorganisms to the antimicrobial agents metronidazole ( henrifarma , china ) and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ( pharmanostra , usa ) and to the vehicles polyethylene glycol ( pm 1000 ) and natrosol , was assessed , either alone and in the following associations : a ) ciprofloxacin and metronidazole ; b ) ciprofloxacin and natrosol ; c ) ciprofloxacin and polyethylene glycol ; d ) metronidazole and natrosol ; e ) metronidazole and polyethylene glycol ; f ) ciprofloxacin , metronidazole and natrosol ; and , g ) ciprofloxacin , metronidazole and polyethylene glycol .
