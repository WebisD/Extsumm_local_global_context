the need for categorization of anomalies and congenital aberrancies formed due to developmental vascular defects produce identifiable birthmarks of the skin and mucosa and a variable degree of underlying soft tissue abnormalities .
thus through the present article we would like to highlight the complexities which can arise from the terminal categorization of the large group of tumors called vascular neoplasms when based on their histopathological representation .
a 9-year - old female patient reported to the department of oral & maxillofacial pathology , i.t.s cdsr , with a complaint of a painless growth with respect to left side of tongue .
the vascular lesions consist of both blood vessels and lymphatic vessels . whether these can be termed as hemangiolymphangioma or just vascular malformation is still confusing .
presently a surge in the knowledge of criterias to classify these various anomalies has put forth classifications purely with respect to histopathological features of the disease .
further detailed analysis of a larger case series would be imperative in the correct classification and diagnosis which could enormously help to accurately ascertain prognosis and direct treatment .
involvement of the oral cavity is common but frequently requires unconventional treatment strategies for its management .
