, we report a case with a 12 cm submucosal signet ring cell type adenocarcinoma , diagnosed by eus - tcb and immunochemical studies .
histologic confirmation of this lesion is difficult , although it is very important for decision of treatment method.1 various methods , including endoscopic ultrasound - guided fine needle aspiration ( eus - fna),2,3 eus - guided trucut biopsy ( eus - tcb ) , endoscopic submucosal - mucosal resection ( esmr),4 and open surgery have been reported to be used for confirmation of the diagnosis.5 however , the best method for tissue acquisition has not been established yet . here
the possibility of signet ring cell carcinoma , which has a poor prognosis , should always be considered even in cases with gcsmt developing in the fourth gastric layer .
a 57-year - old man presented with epigastric pain and a 6 kg weight loss over 3 months .
this case report of a patient with gastric primary signet - ring cell carcinoma with features of gist was confirmed by eus - tcb .
therfore , the eus - tcb was performed in this case for rapid pathology in order to confirm the clinical suspicion with immunohistochemical staining , with a relatively lower complication rate . in conclusion , this is the first report of the eus - tcb used as a diagnostic tool in a case of gastric primary signet - ring cell carcinoma with features of gist .
