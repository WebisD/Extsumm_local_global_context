to this aim we evaluated also conventional arthritic parameters ( hpv , arthritic score , body weight change , and weight of the liver ) along with changes in plasmatic levels of il-1 and crp and the activity of 12/15-lox in the liver .
one of the possible clarifying approaches is to study the mrna expression of key proinflammatory markers ( il-1 , tnf- , and inos ) in the liver of treated and untreated arthritic rats .
, we used the therapeutic dose of mtx ( 0.4  mg / kg ) with the intention to compare each mechanism of action of mtx and n - f-5ht , both evaluated in monotherapy .
. oral daily intake of n - f-5ht could overcome the inconvenient administration and high costs of biological therapy using il-1 monoclonal antibody , which was shown in clinical trials to be superior to placebo in combination with mtx in reducing signs , symptoms , and radiographic progression in patients with advanced ra   .
as the therapeutic dose of mtx was used in this study and the purpose of combination study is to lower the mtx dose to decrease the side effects of this drug , the effect of combination therapy was not included
