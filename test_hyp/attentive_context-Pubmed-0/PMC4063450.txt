given the uncertainties in our understanding 
 of hooh production 
 from ambient pm , our purpose is to quantify hooh formation from transition 
 metals and quinones ( both individually and in mixtures ) in a more 
 representative ( though still cell - free ) surrogate lung fluid ( slf ) . 

taken together , 
 these diverse studies provide consistent evidence that cu is an important 
 component in the health effects from airborne particles .
in this work we characterize an in vitro , cell - free assay to measure 
 the rate of hooh production from pm . given the important role of lung - lining 
 fluid antioxidants in ros formation , we include typical lung concentrations of four antioxidants : ascorbate ( asc ) , reduced 
 glutathione ( gsh ) , urate ( ua ) , and citrate ( cit ) .
, it is impossible to reproduce 
 the complexity of particle  lung interactions using an in vitro assay .
asc , gsh , and ua 
 are naturally occurring in the lung fluid , while cit is a good proxy for proteins that mobilize iron in the 
 lung fluid . while we use ph and antioxidant 
 conditions similar to lung lining fluid
