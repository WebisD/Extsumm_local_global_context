we suspect that the creation of an intra- and peri - graft milieu devoid of proinflammatory cytokines will serve to guide the majority of donor - activated t cells into a tgf1-incited , treg tissue - protective phenotype . indeed
upon activation by donor alloantigens , recipient naive t cells can differentiate into a variety of graft - destructive , effector t cell or graft - protective , regulatory t cell ( treg ) phenotypes .
nonetheless , we believe that favorably tipping the balance of pro- and anti - inflammatory cytokines in the milieu in which non - depleted t cells re - populate will foster t - cell commitment into a tissue - protective mode and promote tolerance . our current efforts at blocking tim4 ( t - cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain - containing protein 4 ) , a molecule upregulated by antigen - presenting cells exposed to proinflammatory cytokines and toll - like receptor agonists , have proven equally successful in promoting long - term engraftment in preclinical models of transplantation and autoimmunity , although this method is not yet ready for testing in humans .
adverse inflammation in the peri - transplant period can guide the majority of donor - activated naive t cells into the graft - protective treg mode .
