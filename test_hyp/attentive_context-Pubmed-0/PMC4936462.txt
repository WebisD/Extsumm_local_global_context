the respiratory physician dealing with asthma , and in particular with severe asthma , has to proceed with detailed functional and inflammatory investigations to better phenotype his / her patient thereby allowing to choose the most appropriate treatment .
there was a time when numerous asthmatics had to be treated with systemic corticoids either on a regular basis or with repeated short courses in order to achieve asthma control . while inhaled 2 agonists became available in the seventies it took until late eighties to have corticoids administered by the inhaled route ( ics ) .
it was then demonstrated that regular treatment with inhaled beclomethasone and budesonide was superior to regular inhalation of short acting 2 agonists in improving asthma symptoms and airway caliber and also reducing the use of rescue inhaled bronchodilators .
in the mid - nineties it became clear that adding long acting 2 agonists ( laba ) to ics markedly improved airway caliber and symptoms , and in particular night symptoms , in those patients who remained uncontrolled with low dose of ics . due to their marked efficacy ,
ics have dramatically changed the course of daily life in many asthmatics over the past decades and are responsible for the sharp reduction in asthma mortality observed since the nineties .
