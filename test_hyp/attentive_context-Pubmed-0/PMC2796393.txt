therefore , we evaluated the efficacy of a novel flow - perfusion bioreactor in sustaining  thick 
we hypothesized that dynamic cell culture with a flow - perfusion bioreactor will provide adequate chemotransportation to the core of a thick scaffold , thereby , maintaining cell viability and activity .
this study demonstrates that thick ( > 6  mm ) 3d constructs are sustainable using a flow - perfusion bioreactor .
specifically , as proof of principle , we tested cylindrical scaffolds measuring 24  mm in diameter and 6  mm in thickness .
however , we noted a linear decline in core cell density over time , with less than 5% of cells remaining after 6 days of static culture . these observed temporospatial differences in cell density with static culture may be explained by two phenomena associated with poor nutrient diffusion : ( 1 ) death of cells in the interior core of the scaffold , and ( 2 ) chemotaxis of cells from the core toward the periphery . in an effort to support 3d tissue - engineered constructs , various bioreactor systems
traditional cell - culture methods are not well suited to the maintenance of 3d tissue - engineered constructs due to the inherent limitation in chemotransportation . in our study , we demonstrated that , under static culture conditions , cells in the peripheral crust up to 2  mm deep from the external surface were able to survive by static diffusion , a finding that is in agreement with other published accounts describing survival to a depth of 1 - 2  mm   .
