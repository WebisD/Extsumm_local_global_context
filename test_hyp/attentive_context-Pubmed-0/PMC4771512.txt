the interobserver reliability was icc  =  0.97 ( 95% ci : 0.96 to 0.98 ) and icc  =  0.97 ( 95% ci : 0.96 to 0.98 ) for the radius and ulna , respectively .
was icc  =  0.93 ( 95% ci : 0.91 to 0.95 ) for the radius and icc  =  0.95 ( 95% ci : 0.930.96 ) for the ulna ; for k.d .- k.l . , icc  =  0.94 ( 95% ci : 0.91 to 0.95 ) for the radius and icc  =  0.95 ( 95% ci : 0.93 to 0.96 ) for the ulna .
further prospective studies are required to test its predictability of peak growth spurt and growth cessation and to compare it with other skeletal growth measures such as the risser sign , tw3 grading , and age of menarche .
sanders et al showed that according to the tw3 , the finger epiphysis maturation is closely related to the peak height velocity.17 the peak height velocity is noted to occur during early adolescence , and menarche and the risser sign appear after the peak growth spurt.18 
  in response to the limitations possessed by the previous methods in assessing skeletal maturity , the distal radius and ulna ( dru ) classification was created and reported by luk et al.19 this classification , which included 11 radius grades ( r1 to r11 ) and 9 ulna grades ( u1 to u9 ) , was found to accurately determine the peak height velocity ( r7 and u5 ) and cessation of growth ( r10 and u9 ) .
