a 14-year - old female presented with left axial proptosis and loss of vision of 1-year duration [ figure 1 ] .
the radiologist 's report suggested a cystic mass to rule out either dermoid cyst or optic nerve glioma .
the histology report revealed features suggestive of dermoid cyst . at follow - up visit after 2 weeks
exploratory supero - temporal orbitotomy was done [ figure 3 ] and a huge intraconal cystic mass was encountered but got ruptured in the process of removal with mainly serous fluid release .
case at presentation with axial proptosis and dilated pupil computed tomography scan highlighting intraconal cystic mass in the left orbit supero - temporal orbitotomy of the left orbit showing cystic mass postoperative picture of patient without proptosis or exotropia
compression of the optic nerve by tumors in the orbital apex will ultimately lead to blindness.2 some studies carried out have suggested the possibility of spontaneous visual recovery perhaps depending on the level of visual affectation when the patient presents.3 in our case report , the lesion was cystic and quite huge in size with presenting visual acuity of npl .
there was left exotropia of about 45 ( hirchberg 's staging ) and computed tomography ( ct)-scan revealed a cystic mass behind the eyeball but within the muscle cone [ figure 2 ] .
