in addition , we used pulsed mixed magic - sandwich echo ( mse ) experiments that provide a near - quantitative refocusing of the rigid contribution to the initial part of the free induction decay ( fid)(44 ) and allow for an essentially quantitative determination of the crystallinity . to our knowledge , this is the first time that advanced nmr pulse sequences performed on a low - field spectrometer were applied to the study of the network structure and phase composition of physical hydrogels .
by using different nmr methodologies , we are able to carry out a complete and quantitative study of the complex structure exhibited by the pva gels : multiple - quantum ( mq ) nmr allows us to gain direct access to residual dipolar coupling constants that persist because of the existence of cross - links and other topological constrains . therefore
, this experimental procedure is a powerful tool for quantifying the gelation process(41 ) and gives us quantitative detail on not only the microstructure(42 ) but also the dynamics(43 ) of the gel , that is , a complete picture of the network structure evolution depending on , for example , the number of freezingthawing cycles .
