in a primary care reallife setting , t2 dm patients in the older age subgroup ( > 65 years ) had a better control of glycaemic targets and cardiovascular risk factors than younger patients in spite of having a higher prevalence of chronic complications . moreover ,
the results evidenced the existence of different profiles between age groups : except for the control of bp , diabetic patients older than 65 years had a better glycaemic control and a better control of dyslipidaemia , obesity and tobacco smoking than patients  65 years ; they were less frequently treated with glucoselowering and lipidlowering drugs , but more frequently with antiplatelet agents .
this differential age and genderrelated pattern stresses the need to individually adapt the therapeutic and care approaches of t2 dm in elderly people to allow the best benefit and the lowest risk at all stages of the disease .
degree of control of main cardiovascular risk factors for t2 dm and pharmacological treatment by gender and age group hba1c 7% = 53 mmol / mol ; hba1c 7.5% = 58.5
patients with t2 dm older than 65 years have a better glycaemic control and a better global control of cardiovascular risk factors than younger adults . however , older age groups were also more likely to achieve glycaemic targets irrespective of having cvd and longer diabetes duration . finally , the use of agents to control hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia was lower in older ages .
