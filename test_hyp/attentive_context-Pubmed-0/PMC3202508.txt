rather , we will review the basic pharmacology of amphetamine - like drugs , integrate these molecular mechanisms into the brain circuitry of reward , and describe how these drugs are thought to create pathological changes in reward and learning circuitry finally , this knowledge will be amalgamated into a vision of future pharmacotherapies for treating psychostimulant addiction .
this article will not significantly address the sociology of psychostimulant abuse , which involves diverse events ranging from the use of amphetamines by japanese soldiers in world war ii , to the formulation of crack as a less expensive version of cocaine in the united states , to the introduction of prescription formulations to regulate eating habits or to treat attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder .  
cocaine and other amphetamine - like psychostimulants have been a significant part of the human pharmacopoeia for thousands of years .
indeed , there already exists an emerging literature supporting this approach in developing potential pharmacotherapies for treating psychostimulant addiction .
the high abuse liability of this class of drugs relies on both pharmacological properties and the sociological characteristics of how the drugs are introduced into various societies around the world .
this review has endeavored to transport the reader from the initiating molecular actions of amphetamine - like psychostimulants on dopamine systems in the brain to enduring neuroplasticity produced in glutamate transmission responsible for communicating from prefrontal and allocortical brain regions through the nucleus accumbens to motor regulatory systems . moreover , by examining molecular neuroplasticity produced in excitatory synapses by chronic psychostimulant administration , it is possible to make some deductions about potential pharmacotherapeutic interventions .
