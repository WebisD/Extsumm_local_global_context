accordingly , there was a positive association between knowledge and nutrition behavior ( p = 0.023 ) and a negative association between perceived barriers and this behavior ( p = 0.004 ) .
furthermore , predictor variables of physical activity behavior are shown in table 4 . according to this table , knowledge ( p = 0.011 ) , perceived severity ( p = 0.009 ) and self - efficacy ( p = 0.033 ) showed positive associations with physical activity behavior , but perceived barriers had a negative association with this behavior ( p = 0.019 ) .   
also in this model , male subjects showed lower mean nutrition behavior compared to female subjects ( p < 0.001 ) .   
totally , 368 subjects including 318 female students ( 86.4% ) and 50 male students ( 13.6% ) took part in the study . the mean age of participants was 24.9 years ( sd = 4.55 ) and the mean weight was 59.58 kg ( sd = 11.3 ) .
considering the importance of behavioral determinants of nutrition and physical activity behaviors due to cardiovascular disease , this study aimed to identify the important predictors of nutrition and physical activity in relation to cardiovascular disease in students of tehran university .
