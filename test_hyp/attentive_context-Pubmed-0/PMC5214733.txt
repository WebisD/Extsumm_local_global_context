community - dwelling elderly persons at high risk of falling should undergo balance training , strengthening exercises , aerobic exercises , and/or resistance exercises .
, multifactorial assessments should include fall history , assessment of gait , balance , mobility , and muscle weakness , assessment of osteoporosis risk , assessment of the older person s perceived functional ability and fear of falling , assessment of visual impairment , assessment of cognitive impairment and neurological examination , assessment of urinary incontinence , assessment of home hazards , cardiovascular examination , and medication review . according to the ags / bgs guidelines
older adults at higher risk of falling , as identified by screening , should be assessed for known risk factors . according to the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) guidelines , older people in contact with healthcare professionals
the risk of falls increases with the number of risk factors , and comprehensive multifactorial assessment and risk factor interventions can decrease the risk of falls and improve the health status of older adults .
in contrast , the american geriatrics society / british geriatrics society ( ags / bgs ) guidelines recommend that all older adults under the care of a health professional should be asked at least once a year about falls , frequency of falling , and difficulties in gait or balance . for individuals who screen positive for falls or fall risk , evaluation of balance and gait should be part of the multifactorial fall risk assessment . commonly used tests of gait or balance include the timed up and go test , the berg balance scale , and the performance - oriented mobility assessment . accordingly , despite the controversy about the frequency of falls risk assessment and tools for gait and mobility evaluation , we recommend that primary care physicians should be able to identify older adults at an increased risk for falls by asking about a history of falls and performing gait or balance tests such as the timed up and go test , the berg balance scale , and the performance - oriented mobility assessment ( fig .
