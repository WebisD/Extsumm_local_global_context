individuals with type 2 diabetes had a 3.71 ml / m higher la volume index , 5.86 g / m higher lv mass index , and 1.64 higher e / e. these associations were attenuated after adjustment for baseline markers of lv systolic and diastolic dysfunction , but type 2 diabetes was still significantly associated with a higher lv mass index ( 3.41 g / m ) and e / e ( 1.43 ) .
strengths include the population - based design and comprehensive assessment of glucose status , arterial stiffness , and lv systolic and diastolic dysfunction .
greater stiffness of carotid , brachial , and femoral arteries , measured as lower distensibility coefficients , was associated with higher levels of la volume index , lv mass index , and e / e ( table 3 ) .
characteristics according to glucose status the presence of type 2 diabetes was associated with more severe levels of all markers of lv systolic and diastolic dysfunction : lv ejection fraction , la volume index , lv mass index , and e / e ( table 2 ) .
incidence of lv diastolic dysfunction grade 2 or 3 was higher with deteriorating glucose status : 88 ( 72% ) in type 2 diabetes versus 52 ( 61% ) in igm and 55 ( 31% ) in ngm .
