ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) is one of the most common congenital cardiac defects . 

, complete atrioventricular block ( avb ) occurs in 
 03% of vsd patients and is a serious complication that can occur both during and after 
 operation . on the other 
 hand ,
traditional open - heart repair has been established as the gold standard for closure of the 
 perimembranous vsd . due to the 
 close proximity to the conduction system
when the patient s anatomy permits , transvenous lead systems should be 
 considered as one of the treatment options in young patients .
a 6-year - old girl with down syndrome , mild mental retardation , congenital heart disease 
 ( patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) and vsd ) was referred to our outpatient pacemaker clinic 
 ( clinical course is summarized in table

the most significant risk factor for avb is down syndrome , and 2.7% of these patients 
 with avb require permanent pacemaker implantation .
our case indicated that transvenous permanent pacemaker implantation is safe and useful in 
 young patients .
