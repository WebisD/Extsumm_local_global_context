the purpose of this study was to determine whether hip synovial fluid cytokine concentrations correlated with post - operative clinical outcomes at a minimum of 2 years following hip arthroscopy for fai .
there was no correlation between synovial fluid cytokine concentrations and post - operative clinical outcome scores at a minimum of 2 years following hip arthroscopy for fai .
statistically significant pre - operative to post - operative improvement was seen in mhhs ( p  <  0.0001 ) , womac ( p  <  0.0001 ) and ihot-33 ( p  < 
the mean mhhs improved from 61.9 to 82.5 { mean difference  =  20.6 [ 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 13.627.6 ] } , womac scores improved from 42.7 to 16.4 ( mean difference  =  26.3 [ 95% ci 17.834.8 ] ) and ihot-33 scores improved from 44.6 to 83.4 ( mean difference  =  38.9 [ 95% ci 29.448.4 ] ) .
this investigation sought to determine whether synovial fluid cytokine concentrations correlated with clinical outcomes at a minimum of 2 years following hip arthroscopy for fai .
larger and longer - term investigations are warranted to further evaluate the relationship of intra - operative cytokine concentration and clinical outcomes after hip arthroscopy .
