the csdd demonstrated moderate interrater agreement between residents and caregivers , and was more reliable when used in cognitively impaired residents . neither the five - factor model , as per the original theoretical construct , nor the four - factor model , in which factor a ( mood - related signs ) and factor e ( ideational disturbance ) were collapsed into a single factor , demonstrated a good fit
the aims of our study were : ( 1 ) to explore the level of interrater agreement between the csdd items , as rated by residents and caregivers , and ( 2 ) to compare the theoretical csdd model with alternative models using this sample .
in this study , we carried out a secondary analysis of data derived from a cross - sectional study into the prevalence of major depressive disorder ( mdd ) in an ltc facility in chiang mai , thailand.13 data were collected between march and june of 2011 .
, there was strong agreement ( icc = 0.71 ) between caregivers and residents in the cognitively impaired group , but only a fair level of agreement in the cognitively intact group ( icc = 0.32 ) . before comparing the models , the factor - analytic study results from the present study ( using residents and caregivers combined )
