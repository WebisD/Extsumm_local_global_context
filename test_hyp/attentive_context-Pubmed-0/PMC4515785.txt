show activity against plasmodium falciparum , we also screened this set of compounds against 
 cultures of drug - sensitive and drug - resistant strains of malaria . 
 in doing so , we noted differential structure  activity relationships 
 for these compounds growth inhibitory properties against each 
 of the parasites , thus launching a multiparasite optimization campaign 
 from the same lead series . in this paper
, we describe these 
 cross - pathogen assay results and 
 outline our evaluation of replacements for the quinazoline scaffold 
 of 1 for each of the parasites .
we have described the discovery of neu-617 ( 1 ) , a 
 derivative of the approved human cancer drug lapatinib ( 2 ) , which acts as a potent , orally bioavailable growth inhibitor of t. brucei that showed a modest effect in a mouse model of 
 bloodstream infection .
we posit that such a 
 cross - screening approach can be a highly fruitful method for identification 
 of new protozoan parasite growth inhibitors .
we were gratified to observe that all 
 of the compounds tested are similarly active against drug resistant 
 strains of p. falciparum ( table s9 , supporting information ) , suggesting that despite the shared 
 scaffold , these analogs likely display a mechanism of action or mechanism 
 of resistance that differs from those of chloroquine .
