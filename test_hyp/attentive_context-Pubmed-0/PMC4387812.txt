as there is uncertainty regarding the frequency and determinants of depression , this study was planned to assess the magnitude of depression in acute stroke patients admitted in a rural tertiary care hospital and to analyze the association of demographic variables ( age , gender , socio - economic status and educational status ) , co - morbid conditions or risk factors and radiological imaging variables with depression .
early diagnosis and effective treatment of depression might improve functional recovery , cognitive performance , drug compliance , quality of life , and social and rehabilitation outcome of stroke patients .
distribution of depression among stroke patients distribution of demographic variables among patients with or without depression distribution of comorbid diseases / risk factors among patients with or without depression in the radiological imaging ( ct / mri head ) of cv stroke patients , 61 ( 57% ) patients had left - sided lesions , 42 ( 39% ) patients had right - sided lesions and 4 ( 4% ) had bilateral lesions .
ses ( pci ) was significantly associated with depression in our stroke patients ( p < 0.05 ) [ table 5 ] .
of the 107 patients , 69 ( 64% ) had hypertension , 18 ( 17% ) had dm , 16 ( 15% ) had ihd and 18 ( 17% ) had previous history of cv stroke .
