this consensus statement defined the contribution of family medicine to equity , quality and phc within an african context , as well as the role and training requirements of the african family physician ( 15 ) . due to the low number of trained doctors per capita and the high burden of disease , african family physicians work in their specific context , mainly in district hospitals with outreach to health centres , in phc teams that address the problems of the community in a comprehensive , holistic and patient - centred way whereby specific skills like surgery and district management often are essential due to the lack of other specialists .
family physicians together with phc nurses ( and in some countries , mid - level care workers ) act as the clinical practitioners of the phc team . in 2009 , the 62nd world health assembly urged its member states to train and retain adequate numbers of health workers , including family physicians , and to encourage the implementation of vertical programmes in the context of integrated phc ( 10 ) . in 1968 ,
health systems based on primary health care ( phc ) distribute health care more equitably , are more cost effective and have better overall health outcomes and impact than health systems based on specialist care ( 1 ) .
