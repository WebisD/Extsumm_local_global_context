reported cases of varices have been found in the stomach , small bowel , biliary tree , colon , rectum , and even the site of a surgical ostomy .
this is the first case of cecal varices reported that has not resulted in massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding .
he is clinically stable and has no clinical evidence indicating a history of active bleeding from those varices .
a history of abdominal surgery may predispose a patient to develop varices of the lower gastrointestinal tract   .
given the colonoscopic finding , we believe that the internal hemorrhoids and not the cecal varices may have contributed to his clinical presentation . by reporting our experience we emphasize that cecal varices are very rare and may also be present in stable patients without massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding . because of the paucity of data , the proper management of patients with colonic varices is unknown .
this case of cecal and ascending colon varices is presented because of the uniqueness of this anomaly within the colon and most notably the cecum . in the literature , a total of seventeen cases ( including this one ) of cecal varices
the cases of cecal varices that have been reported have all presented clinically with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating urgent management with blood products and surgical or endoscopic intervention . to our knowledge
