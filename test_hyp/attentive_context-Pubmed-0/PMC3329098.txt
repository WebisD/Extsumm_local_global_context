girls are often married before the age of menarche thus making adolescent pregnancies and their associated complications common finding in the area.8 some of the complications of adolescent childbirth ( cephalopelvic disproportion with associated caesarean delivery and vesico vaginal fistula ) often necessitate elective caesarean section in subsequent pregnancies.1011 paucity of data in the literature on elective caesarean section in sokoto , north western nigeria informed this study .
this is because when the fistula is successfully repaired , subsequent deliveries are usually by elective caesarean operation.16 the rising trend of elective caesarean in these data has similarly been observed by previous authors.46 the reason for this may be the ever increasing list of the indications of elective caesarean delivery , larger cohort of patients with two or more previous caesarean section , and improved patient selection by clinicians with the use of better diagnostic techniques such as ultrasound machine.5 the most common indication in this study , repeat caesarean section , has also been reported in previous studies.4613 however , the second leading indication for the procedure in these data , malpresentation , is in contrast to bad obstetric history and hiv infection in pregnancy reported in jos and makurdi respectivelty.46 in conclusion , the rising trend of elective caesarean section observed in this study , underscores the need to better and improved patient selection together with counseling on its benefits and risks as elective caesarean operation though safer than its emergency counterpart is not entirely free of morbidity or mortality to both the mother and the baby . in addition routine use of spinal anesthesia in performing the procedure should be encouraged .
