ultrasound cnb is a well - known , safe and accurate technique that is currently considered the elective method , whereas stereotaxy and mri should be reserved for lesions that are not clearly seen on ultrasound .
the percutaneous biopsy devices have evolved , from fine - needle aspiration cytology towards core - needle biopsy ( cnb ) and later vacuum - assisted biopsy ( vab ) .
complications are infrequent and not serious . for these reasons , we would encourage all breast radiologists to gain plenty of experience of this technique .
the numerous advantages of ultrasound guidance over stereotactic and mr guidance have been key in explaining the widespread use of this technique .
percutaneous biopsy is less invasive than surgery , can be performed quickly , does not deform the breast , causes minimal scarring , complications ( haematoma and infection ) are infrequently found ( less than one case in 1,000 ) , fewer surgeries are needed for patients who undergo percutaneous biopsies and therefore the cost of diagnosis is lower   .
nowadays , ultrasound - guided core needle breast biopsy has become the first choice for performing a percutaneous biopsy for most lesions seen on ultrasound   .
