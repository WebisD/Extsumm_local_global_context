hysterectomy following cesarean section ( cs ) was first described by porro , and was used to prevent maternal mortality due to post partum hemorrhage .
eph is the most dramatic operation in modern obstetrics and is generally performed when all conservative measures have failed to achieve haemostasis in the setting of life threatening hemorrhage . the unplanned nature of the surgery and the need for performing it expeditiously , compound matters .
although no risk assessment system can predict all instances where cesarean delivery will be needed , a significant percentage of the patients who are at high risk for severe hemorrhage and the subsequent need of emergency hysterectomy can be identified before surgery .
the presence of preoperative risk factors should facilitate consultation , referral or transfer of patients before surgery to a tertiary care facility . due to the complexity of the surgery and decision making ,
emergency peripartum hysterectomy ( eph ) is a major surgical venture invariably performed in the setting of life threatening hemorrhage during or immediately after abdominal and vaginal deliveries   . despite advances in medical and surgical fields
, post partum hemorrhage continues to be the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality .
