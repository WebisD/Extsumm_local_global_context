, our study showed that patients with type 2 dm demonstrated ip in similar frequency and intensity compared with nondiabetic patients and , interestingly , our data indicated an improvement in ischemic parameters associated with diabetes .
thus , in this study , we aimed at identifying ip in symptomatic multivessel cad patients and compared the results among patients with and without type 2 dm .
ip  =  ischemic preconditioning the t-1.0  mm results demonstrated that diabetic patients who demonstrated ip had an improvement in t-1.0  mm between the 2 sets of 79.4    47.6  s , whereas nondiabetic patients who demonstrated ip had an improvement of 65.5    36.4  s ( table  3 , p  =  0.12).table 3t-1.0  mm in exercise test 1 ( et1 ) and exercise test 2 ( et2 ) and the difference between the 2 tests ( et2-et1 ) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients who demonstrated ip ( ip+ ) or who did not demonstrate ip ( ip-)et1et2et2-et1

the improvement in the frequency and severity of arrhythmias had similar results among diabetic and nondiabetic patients who experienced ip ( 50  % versus 63  % of patients demonstrated improvement in arrhythmias , respectively ; p  =  0.41 ) .
