in this and the next issue of critical care , john haddad   presents a comprehensive review on the contributions of transcription factors to lung injury .
we continue to explore the association of gene and environment . with respect to lung injury ,
haddad   discusses the rationale for the use of tyloxapol to reduce proinflammatory cytokines , n - acetyl cysteine ( a glutathione precursor ) to reduce neutrophil - associated alveolitis in chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis , and the use of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate in transplantation to reduce neutrophil - associated oxidant lung injury .
two new compounds , isohelenin and lisofylline , a phosphodiesterase inhibitor , are described as being able to reduce proinflammatory cytokines and ameliorate oxidant lung injury in animal models . as exciting as this emerging field is , with its predictable contribution to future ' bench to bedside ' discussions , a more complete mechanistic understanding and future clinical trials will assist in the realization of improved treatment and reduced mortality from oxidant - mediated lung injury .
we need to identify and understand the mechanisms that predispose patients to the excessive inflammation resulting from an overactive innate immune response that characterizes sepsis and lung injury . these include stimuli , signal transduction ( receptors , enzyme cascades , transcription factors ) , gene(s ) response and the measured clinical phenotype .
