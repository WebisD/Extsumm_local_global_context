when further adjusted by the interaction between line of therapy and treatment group , tot was longer in patients who received everolimus - based therapy in all lines of therapy than patients who received chemotherapy in the same lines ( adjusted first - line hr = 0.30 , 95% ci : 0.200.46 , p < 0.001 ; adjusted second - line hr = 0.30 , 95% ci : 0.170.52 , p < 0.001 ; adjusted third - line and above hr = 0.45 , 95% ci : 0.260.78 , p = 0.004 ; table 3 ) .
the present study aims to address this knowledge gap and to compare the real - world effectiveness of everolimus - based therapy versus chemotherapy in treating hr+/her2 mbc patients in community - based oncology practices in the us .
in this retrospective review of hr+/her2 mbc patients from community - based oncology practices in the us , patients treated with everolimus - based therapy tended to have less aggressive mbc than patients treated with chemotherapy .
after controlling for the observed baseline characteristics , everolimus - based therapy was associated with significantly longer os , pfs , and tot than chemotherapy . as this is an observational study , unobserved patient characteristics may affect study findings .
