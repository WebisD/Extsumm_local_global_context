ligamentous stabilizers of the knee mainly include anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) ; posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) ; posterolateral complex ( plc ) composed of lateral collateral ligament ( lcl ) , popliteal tendon and popliteofibular ligament ; posteromedial complex ( pmc ) comprised of superficial medial collateral ligament ( smcl ) , deep medial collateral ligament ( dmcl ) and posterior oblique ligament ( pol).1234 multiple ligament injuries typically involve more than 2 of the main 4 ligamentous structure , arising from an acute knee dislocation caused by violent trauma
no patients had gross mal - alignment or gait abnormalities such as limp , varus thrust , or valgus thrust . comparing preoperative data versus those at the latest followup , significant improvements in knee stabilities ( p < 0.01 ) , lysholm score ( p < 0.01 ) and international knee documentation committee ( ikdc ) grade ( p < 0.01 ) were noted in all groups .
multiple mean comparison showed a significant differences in the subscale of sports between the one - stage group and the ea ligament repair group ( p = 0.002 ) , a meaningful difference in the subscale of knee symptom between the one - stage group and the ea ligament repair group ( p = 0.005 ) .
