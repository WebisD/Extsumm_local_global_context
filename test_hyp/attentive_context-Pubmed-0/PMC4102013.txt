isolated caudate lobectomy , a parenchyma - sparing procedure , is still a challenge for hepatobiliary surgeons , especially in cirrhotic patients .
patients with malignant tumors should be followed up regularly after operation for recurrence and for adjuvant therapy .
the caudate lobe lies deep in the liver , between the hepatic hila and the retrohepatic inferior vena cava ( ivc ) , and is adjacent to the major hepatic veins in its upper part .
16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy in our departments from january 2010 to december 2013 were reviewed to optimize the operation . according to kumon 's nomenclature ,
surgical resection is left the only radical solution for symptomatic benign tumors and malignant tumors confined to the lobe .
percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) for tumors in the caudate lobe are difficult to be carried out because of their spatial peculiarity .
the best surgical strategy is the one that is uncomplicated and easy to be mastered by most hepatobiliary surgeons , with fewer traumas and complications . and under the principle of mobilizing the caudate lobe firstly , controlling the outflow and then inflow vessels secondly , and dividing the liver parenchyma thirdly , it is advised that the relatively easier and safer step should be carried out first .
