, we undertook a randomized comparative study to assess and compare the efficacies of 10% koh aqueous solution and 5% imiquimod cream for the treatment of mc in the pediatric age group .
after obtaining permission from the institutional ethics committee , 40 patients between the age group of 1 - 18 years with minimum 3 lesions of mc were recruited to this study .
koh solution when used in the concentration of 10% is effective and safe in treating mc .
disappearance of lesions following treatment with imiquimod before and after treatment with imiquimod pigmentary disturbance seen following treatment with potassium hydroxide before and after treatment with potassium hydroxide overall , a better response was shown by patients who received koh as compared to those who received imiquimod , and the difference was statistically significant as p = 0.010 at 1 and 2 follow - up ; and p = 0.019 at the last follow - up [ table 1 ] .
patients were followed up at 4 , 8 and 12 week of treatment . on each visit , clinical response to treatment , efficacy , and
, absolute clearance of lesions was seen in 8 ( 57% ) of 14 patients with imiquimod , and 10 ( 77% ) out of 13 patients with koh , which is in accordance with the sfindings of our study .
