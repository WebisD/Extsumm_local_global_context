our results indicated that ( a ) the paretic lower limb 
 strength was correlated with the nonparetic lower limb strength , ( b ) both the paretic and 
 nonparetic knee extension strengths were predictors of gait performance in older patients 
 with poststroke hemiparesis , ( c ) the paretic knee extension strength affected gait 
 performance more than the nonparetic strength , and ( d ) the strength indices of the paretic 
 and nonparetic strengths combined with the weighted impact for gait performance could 
 predict gait performance .
however , because spasticity of knee extensor and flexor muscles in 
 stroke patients was not examined in this study , further research is needed to investigate 
 the relationship between lower limb strength and spasticity and gait performance .
in the present study , a relation between both paretic and nonparetic lower limb strength 
 and gait performance was discovered .
a strength index of 2.0 , meaning that the prediction of gait 
 performance was deduced from the bilateral knee extension strengths , provides the best 
 balance between positive and negative predictive values .
the discriminant analysis classified the difference between the ability 
 and inability to walk ( eigenvalue , 0.49 ; wilks lambda , 0.67 ;  , 93.85 ; df , 2 ; p 
 < 0.0001 ) .
