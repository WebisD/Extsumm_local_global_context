however , the increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance , coupled with a significant decline in production of new antibacterials , means that probiotics are finally coming of age , representing a real alternative to traditional drug based therapies   .
a primary focus of this approach involves equipping probiotic bacteria with the genetic elements necessary to overcome the many stresses encountered during the probiotic life cycle ( both external and internal to the host ) as well as enabling probiotics to better deal with invading pathogens   .
the second approach aims to improve host persistence by expression of host specific survival strategies ( or virulence associated factors  such as the ability to cope with bile ; an important component of the bodies physicochemical defence system ) thereby positively affecting the therapeutic efficacy of the probiotic .
engineered probiotics thus have the potential to alleviate the symptoms of chronic gastrointestinal disorders and associated sequelae , to fight infection , modulate the immune system , and act as delivery vehicles for bioactive molecules . notwithstanding these impressive health benefits ,
the first tackles the issue of probiotic storage and delivery by cloning and expression of pathogen specific stress survival mechanisms ( facilitating improved survival at extremes of temperature and water availability ) , thus countering reductions in probiotic numbers which can occur during manufacture and storage of delivery matrices ( such as foods and tablet formulations ) .
