in this mini - review we highlighted the most important areas to be considered under a cell replacement therapy .
the culture systems currently encounter the problem of suboptimal quality of xeno - free culture constituents . thus strategies are needed to overcome this difficulty ( sidhu et al . , 2008 ) .
the possibility of using hipsc derived therapeutic cells in cell replacement therapies requires still long - term studies in non - human animal models addressing the questions of immunogenicity , epigenetic and genetic stability of these cells , and the optimized differentiation of the cells .
first the infection free status of the donors has to be addressed , in europe couples are tested before any fertility treatment is offered , but the cells themselves have to be tested , too ( hovatta , 2011 ) .
as discussed earlier , an optimal engraftment and cell replacement strategy should account for a minimal immune reaction in the recipient .
challenges with the immunoreactivity of the transplantable cells could be addressed by rigorous immunosuppressive treatments . unfortunately , this is not desired , since there is a clear correlation between the length and intensity of exposure to immunosuppressive therapy and post - transplant risk of malignancy and tumor aggressiveness ( gutierrez - dalmau and campistol , 2007 ) .
