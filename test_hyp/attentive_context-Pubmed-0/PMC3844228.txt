, we aimed to evaluate the activity of choroidal neovascularization with sd - oct in the namd patients who were on an as - needed treatment regimen with ranibizumab and were diagnosed to have an inactive choroidal neovascularization with td - oct and clinical examination one month after intravitreal ranibizumab injection .
the mean ratio between the mean crt measured with sd - oct and crt measured with td - oct was 1.51  0.09 .   as the patients who did not show any amount of subretinal , intraretinal , or subrpe fluid in td - oct were the subjects of this study , any kind of retinal fluid was not detected in td - oct . however , 16 of the 49 patients ( 32.6% ) showed subretinal , and/or intraretinal , and/or subrpe fluid on sd - oct .
in detail , 8 patients showed ( 16.3% ) subretinal fluid , 10 patients ( 20.4% ) showed intraretinal fluid , and 3 patients ( 6.1% ) showed subrpe fluid ( table 1 ) ( figure 1 ) .
mean crt of the patients via td - oct was 218.1  51.3 microns ( range 139418 microns ) , and the mean crt via sd - oct was 325.7  78.8 ( range 222508 microns ) .
