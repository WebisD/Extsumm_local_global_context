therefore , we propose that dorsal fins , because of their ease in recording , illustrated longevity and potential for universal application , be prioritized as a method to document individual white sharks . this methodology can not only be used to monitor the status of the white shark population in the northeast pacific , but unlike other photo - identification methods , it can be more uniformly applied to archive white sharks worldwide , standardizing documentation of individuals across vast spatial and temporal scales .
our findings support the use of the trailing edge of the dorsal fin for long - term photo - identification studies at coastal aggregation sites .
we photographically identified five white sharks repeatedly over a period of 1622  years . through the use of secondary characteristics and comparisons of first and last photographs of these five sharks
dorsal fin identification offers the foundation for mark - recapture studies to quantify the population size and trends of white sharks . if possible , we suggest all available data be recorded ( e.g. , fin photographs and body pigments )
