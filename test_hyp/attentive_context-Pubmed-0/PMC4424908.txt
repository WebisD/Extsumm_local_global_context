hoc tukey test , it was found that the change in group 2 patients was significantly lower than the change in group 3 patients ( p=0.024 ) .

when the refractive value differences between both eyes were evaluated , no significant difference was found in se and cse measurements ( p=0.411 and 0.536 ) . to evaluate
