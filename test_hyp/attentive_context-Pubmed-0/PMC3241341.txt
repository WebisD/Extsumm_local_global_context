dire clinical consequences are linked to its impediment in pathological conditions . yet , as a common reference of conscious experiences , it provides us with an adaptive tool for building a unified self and personality over the years by successfully balancing the allocation of brain resources for survival and procreation .
there is a clear lesson for consciousness research initially emerging from studying the brain activity in experienced yoga - nidra teachers during meditation but subsequently supported by a wealth of other experiments : a common paralimbic network serves to regulate and balance the dynamic resource allocation needed to ensure survival .
this process is guided by processes linked to awareness , attention , and emotion in order to support memory - dependent self - reference , which in narrative self - consciousness is extended into adjacent neocortical regions .
the scientific study of human consciousness is growing beyond its infancy and many interesting properties of its underlying neuronal substrates have been established ( changeux and lou , 2011 ) . yet
some progress has been made in identifying how self - awareness can help in shaping the decision making .
, this conceptualization leaves out the importance of reward and emotion in guiding the crucial decision making involved in optimizing resource allocation of brain resources , which we discuss in this review .
