transposases are enzymes that catalyze the movement of mobile genetic elements in and between genomes and are the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature ( 1 )
we inferred that some of the expressed transposases are active by excluding the two main reasons for potential inactivity : ( i ) transposase genes could be in the process of gene degradation so that their expression would lead to incomplete and potentially inactive transposases and ( ii ) the expression of some transposase genes is regulated through programmed translational frameshifting , which would lead to the translation of a truncated , nonfunctional version of the transposase protein ( 6 , 11 , 33 ) .
our metaproteomic analyses revealed that the 1 and 1 symbionts express a surprisingly high number of their transposase proteins , many of which are intact and possibly active , and we hypothesize that abundant transposase expression plays a key role in te expansion .
do the symbionts have multiple genome copies that buffer against the deleterious effects of transposase activity ? to answer these questions , we are currently sequencing the genomes of single symbiont cells to examine how common transposition events are within the same individual host , within the host population , and between host populations .
