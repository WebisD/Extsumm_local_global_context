considering the literature on psychometric performance impairment , the lead - exposed subjects examined in the present study were expected to exhibit effects which relate to the short - term memory , the discrimination capacity , or the speed of information processing as well as the motor reaction time .
in fact , only few of the present performance findings came up to the hypothetical expectations of being early indicators of a lead - induced neurotoxic harm .
the hypothesis of an impaired subjective sensation of the state of health and the mental state was confirmed for a number of categories in lead - exposed workers versus controls , and the findings were statistically significant . in this context ,
modern occupational medicine should proceed along these lines so as to meet the self - set high standard of optimal prevention for all working people .
in east germany , an old nonferrous metal works facility was available for the investigation in which ,  ideally suited  for the study , 70 male workers had been continuously exposed to occupational lead over not less than 5 years , with exposure levels being roughly identical to the current german threshold limit value for lead of 0.1 mg / m. of these 70 males , 21 had had a verified permanent lead concentration of more than 35 g / dl over the past 510 years .
