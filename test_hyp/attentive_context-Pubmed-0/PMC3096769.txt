high baseline disability , sudden occurrence of symptoms , long duration of symptoms , female gender and young age were found to be weak predictors of poor outcome .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate short - term ( median 18  months after surgery ) and medium - term ( median 4  years after the surgery ) results after open lateral release in recalcitrant tennis elbow and to determine any prognostic factors .
we found a weak correlation between the quickdash at the final follow - up ( a high value denotes residual symptoms ) and baseline quickdash ( r  =  0.388 ; p  <  0.001 ) , acute occurrence of symptoms ( r  =  0.362 ; p  <  0.001 ) , duration of symptoms ( r  =  0.276 ; p  =  0.007 ) , female gender of patient ( r  =  0.269 ; p  =  0.009 ) and age of patient ( r  =  0.203 ; p  =  0.04 ) .
