the objective of our study was to examine the relationships between intracranial radiographic abnormalities and preimplantation developmental assessment ( including head circumference ) with postimplant audiometric and language outcomes in children with symptomatic congenital cmv who have undergone cochlear implantation .
early measurements such as brain imaging findings , head circumference , and iq / dq may allow for more accurate counseling of families regarding anticipated postimplantation performance in children with symptomatic congenital cmv .
although our study has limitations including its retrospective nature and small sample size , it provides data that may further efforts to identify factors which may help predict which children with congenital symptomatic cmv will benefit from ci . the presence of cerebellar anomalies or greater than one cns abnormality on imaging correlates with poorer outcomes after ci . the location of cns abnormalities , including calcifications , may play a role in audiometric and language outcomes after ci .
periventricular calcifications were associated with lower receptive language ( rb = 0.75 , p = 0.03 ) and expressive language ( rb = 0.84 , p = 0.008 ) among children with post - ci assessments .
seventy - three percent ( n = 11 ) of children had a diagnosis of cognitive impairment and 13 children ( 87% ) had a motor delay or disability ; 9 had a diagnosis of cp .
