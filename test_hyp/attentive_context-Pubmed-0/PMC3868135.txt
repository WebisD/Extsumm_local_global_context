the aim of the present study , was to investigate anatomical morphologic trends with respect to linear and angular parameters associated with anterior transpedicular screw fixation in the cervical spine .
our data indicated that the anterior transpedicular screw fixation in the cervical spine , results in more strength and can provide longer pathway than in cervical posterior transpedicular fixation . thus longer
pedicle screws can be used in males than in females for anterior transpedicular screw fixation in the cervical spine . to conclude the results suggest that the placement of cervical anterior transpedicular screws should be individualized for each patient .
the preoperative helical ct scans and reconstructions for patients who would undergo cervical anterior transpedicular fixation should be thoroughly analyzed with attention to the pedicle size and its angulation .
morphological parameters for cervical anterior transpedicular screw fixation were measured using a helical computed tomography ( ct ) scan and reconstruction at the radiology imaging department of our university hospital .
the mpal was lower in females than that in males at all levels and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
the independent t test was performed to analyze the difference of the parameters for cervical anterior transpedicular screws fixation between females and males p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
