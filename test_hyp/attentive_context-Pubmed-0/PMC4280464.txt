a 38-year - old female patient presented with reduced vision in the right eye , which had occurred the same day .
antiphospholipid syndrome ( aps ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies , venous and/or arterial thrombosis , and repetitive fetal loss   .
this is the first reported case of simultaneous subhyaloid hemorrhage and branch retinal vein subocclusion as presentations of aps .
the use of tobacco and oral anticontraceptive agents as well as the history of previous of thrombosis , fetal loss , and acute ischemic events is mandatory in the process of deciding whether to start systemic treatment .
the subhyaloid hemorrhage resolved spontaneously and the patient recovered a visual acuity of 20/20 in her right eye 3 months after the initial episode ( fig .
ocular discomfort , conjunctival hyperemia , and pain have often been reported in the literature as common symptoms of aps patients .
visual symptoms at presentation vary from a reduction of visual acuity and amaurosis fugax to transient scotoma and visual field defect , all of which can be unilateral or bilateral .
it is therefore important to make a quick diagnosis in order to consider anticoagulant treatment to prevent further thrombosis , as the risk of this complication is up to 29% in untreated aps patients .
