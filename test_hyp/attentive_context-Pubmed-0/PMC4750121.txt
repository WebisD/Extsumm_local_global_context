the aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of niv during sedation in catheter ablation of use af instead of atrial fibrillation compared to deep sedation .
in the study period ( 24 months ) , conducted in a single high - volume electrophysiology procedure center , consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for paroxysmal / persistent atrial fibrillation   were retrospectively revised ( fig .  1 ) .
the two groups of patients showed no differences in these fields , but between the two groups , a significant variation was present in the basal paco2 ( p  =  0.008 )  with values in the physiological range  and in intra - procedural blood gas parameters ( ph p  =  0.001 , pao2 
 p  =  0.004 , paco2 
 p  =  0.002 respectively ( fig . 
3 ) shows a statistical variation in the changing of ph and paco2 ( p  =  0.002 and 0.001 , respectively ) . during niv procedures
during the study period 72 electrophysiology procedures carried out in deep sedation were evaluated ; 41 ( 57% ) procedures were performed with niv ( niv group ) and the other 31 ( 43% ) with - out niv ( deep sedation group ) .
