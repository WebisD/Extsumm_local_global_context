this prospective feasibility study was designed to assess the accuracy of ceus of the breast for pre - operative tumor size measurement in patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast .
tumor as measured with gray - scale ultrasound of the breast was within 2  mm of the pathologic tumor size in only 2/9 cases ( 22% ) , whereas ceus of the breast accurately assessed tumor size within 2  mm of pathologic tumor size in 6/9 ( 67% ) of the cases ( p  <  0.05 ) .
gray - scale ultrasound image of an irregular , not parallel oriented , spiculated breast lesion , classified as bi - rads v in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast . for measurements ( see lines ) , the tumor edge was defined as the end of the hypoechoic mass before the hyperechoic transition border ( so - called  echogenic interface ) between tumor and healthy surrounding tissue .
baseline characteristics of 10 breast tumors according to sonographic bi - rads lexicon criteria   combined pattern implied both posterior acoustic shadowing and enhancement .
gray - scale ultrasound of the breast showed a mean greatest tumor diameter of 15.5  mm ( range 10.120.6  mm ) , compared to 16.5  mm ( range 11.518.5  mm ) in the ceus group .
