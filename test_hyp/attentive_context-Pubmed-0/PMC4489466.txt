2012 ) , diversity in its wild and human hosts , in 
 their potential susceptibility to infection and in their response and there is also 
 diversity in the behaviours of the people infected and their social environment , 
 generating a variety of risk or protection scenarios for the various forms of 
 transmission . 
 fig .
the hypothesis is that in 
 the future always will remain just few new cases , but the conjunction of the previous 
 goal described will allow to eliminate chagas disease as a public health problem . in 
 this sense a cut - off point of magnitude of prevalence or incidences of people infected 
 and its burden disease to decide when chagas disease is not a public health problem has 
 to be developed .

 modes of transmission and distribution factors - various scenarios 
 should be considered when trying to understand the transmission dynamics of t. 
 cruzi .
measures available of 
 prevention of chagas disease can reach high level of control due to total interruption 
 of transmission by transfusion , total interruption of vector transmission in large areas 
 and partial interruption or control in areas like amazon region and adequate level of 
 coverage of timely diagnoses and treatment of people infected .
