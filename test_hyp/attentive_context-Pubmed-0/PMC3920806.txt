sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma ( suvc ) is rare and because of its rarity most practitioners including urologists and oncologists may not have encountered the disease .
the literature on sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma has been reviewed in the ensuing paper .
sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinomas may generally present with specific symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms and haematuria .
urologists and oncologists should be encouraged to report cases of sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma they encounter in order to contribute to the understanding of the biological behaviour of the tumour .
there is a need for a multicentre trial of various treatment options for sarcomatoid variants of urothelial carcinoma in order to arrive at a consensus opinion regarding the best treatment option .
sarcomatoid carcinoma is a fairly uncommon form of carcinoma whose malignant cells have histological , cytological , or molecular properties of both epithelial tumours (  carcinoma  ) and mesenchymal tumours (  sarcoma  ) .
sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma is a rare aggressive type of tumour which tends to present at a younger age and at a higher grade and stage .
eble et al .   stated that sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma should be the terminology that is used for all biphasic malignant neoplasms which exhibit morphologic and/or immunohistochemical evidence of epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation with the presence or absence of heterologous elements acknowledged in the pathology report .
