this study therefore evaluates the pattern of steroid sensitivity among a cohort of black children with childhood nephrotic syndrome .
one was with haemoglobin ss disease ( hbss ) presented in ckd while the others ( sle : 2 ; fsgs : 2 ; idiopathic : 2 ) developed ckd within 2 years of diagnosis . there were 7 deaths as follows : complications of eskd in 3 ( lupus nephritis : 1 , fsgs :  1 , and ins :  1 ) ; aki in 2 patients , one of whom had lupus nephritis , and 2 newly diagnosed patients with undetermined steroid sensitivity one of whom died from a cerebrovascular accident .
seven children ( 6.5% ) , all with srns , developed chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) of whom 5 progressed to end - stage kidney disease ( eskd ) during the review period .
histologic patterns among the 8 with idiopathic srns were fsgs in 5 ( 62.5% ) , mcns in 2 ( 25% ) , and mpgn in 1 ( 12.5% ) . 

histological findings were as follows : focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) in 8 ( 53.3% ) , minimal change disease ( mcns ) in 3 ( 20% ) and 1 ( 6.7% ) each of membranous nephropathy , membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( mpgn ) , diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis , and class 3 lupus nephritis .
