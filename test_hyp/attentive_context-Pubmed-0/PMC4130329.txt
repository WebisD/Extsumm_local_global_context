this report presents our initial experience with robot - assisted axillary exposure of the brachial plexus region . in our opinion
brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted .
this report will focus on the evaluation of axillary robotic approach as the advantages and disadvantages of supraclavicular robotic intervention have been widely discussed in the literature .
we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ) .
robotic surgery will be used routinely in the future for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for tos that is caused by bone and/or soft tissue . however , newer dedicated surgical instruments need to be developed and further studies should be conducted to evaluate in vivo application and results of this novel approach .
a human cadaver was subjected to this experiment in paris university ecole europenne de chirurgie anatomy laboratory and da vinci robot system was used .
the experience of the whole surgical team with robotic technology is important for the procedure . during learning curve period ,
