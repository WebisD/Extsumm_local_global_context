liquid phase equilibrium data were measured in this study for the extraction of thiophene or benzothiophene from heptane using two ils . four ternary systems { il  +  thiophene or benzothiophene  +  heptane } were analytically determined using gc for the composition analysis at temperature t  =  308.15  k at ambient pressure .
the capacity of extraction , described in terms of the selectivity and the solute distribution ratio coefficients , was calculated for all ternary systems and compared to the published data used in similar extraction problems .
5 ) , which may be compared with the results of the hds method for the removal of the s - compounds . the experimental data in this work
based on the values obtained , [ c1c5pip][ntf2 ] was found to be useful for the extraction of sulfur compounds from alkanes ; however , it is not as good as [ c1c3pip][ntf2 ] measured previously . the selectivity and the solute distribution ratio decrease as the mole fraction of thiophene or benzothiophene in the heptane - rich phase increases . the best selectivity ( s )
