therefore , this study determined the effect of passive 
 static stretching on blood glucose levels in people with t2 dm .
therefore , further 
 studies are required to ascertain the long - term ( i.e. , more than 3 months ) effects of 
 passive static stretching on blood glucose levels in a larger population of patients with 
 t2 dm .
patients were randomized to the control group ( n = 7 ) or passive static 
 stretching group ( pss , n = 8) . the control group was instructed to maintain 
 their diet and medications for diabetes and not to perform any exercise during the 
 experiment .
as mentioned above , this study determined the effect of passive static stretching on blood 
 glucose levels in patients with t2 dm . the results showed hba1c levels decreased 
 significantly after an 8-week passive static stretching intervention .
the baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in table 2table 2.baseline characteristics of the patientscon ( n = 7)pss ( n = 8)page ( years)58.4  1.849.6  5.20.2duration of diabetes ( years ) 5.2  2.9 5.4 
however , hba1c levels decreased significantly in the pss 
 group after the intervention ( p < 0.05 ) and were significantly different between groups 
 ( p < 0.05 ) .
