, we are presenting two cases who had developed upper limb dvt while resolving phase of their sepsis with reactive thrombocytosis .
deep venous thrombosis ( dvt ) is a common condition that affects approximately 1 in 1000 persons / year .
intensive care unit patient having reactive thrombocytosis during the recovery phase of sepsis must be kept in priority for screening to rule out dvt , so that timely therapeutic intervention could avoid a life - threatening pulmonary embolism .
upper limb dvt is increasingly being recognized as a clinical entity with potential for considerable morbidity .
it usually refers to thrombosis of the axillary or subclavian veins , occurs spontaneously or sometimes develops as a complication of pacemaker use , long - term central venous catheter ( cvc ) use , or cancer .
approximately , 10% of all cases of deep - vein thrombosis involve the upper extremities , resulting in an annual incidence of 0.4 - 1 case/10,000 people . here
dvt has a prevalence of 10.5 - 11.9% in patients who are admitted in intensive care unit ( icu ) among indian patients .
a 37-year - old man referred to our icu with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and septic shock on the 23 day of his illness .
