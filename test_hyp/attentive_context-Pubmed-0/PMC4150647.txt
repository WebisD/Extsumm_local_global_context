this work aims to denote that a ) selected cases with converging semiological , electrophysiological and structural / functional imaging evidence of localized ictal onsets may show favorable postsurgical results to focal - tailored resections and b ) accompanying mesio - temporal pathology ipsilateral to the gross lesion may not contribute to seizure generation .
the new proposal for classification of focal cortical dysplasia ( fcd ) recognizes a particular type , iiid fcd , associated with an epileptogenic lesion acquired in early life ( i.e. , traumatic injury , ischemic injury or encephalitis ) .
our experience suggests that stereotyped focal - onset seizure semiology along with concordant localized interictal / ictal eeg and functional data is essential for identifying such candidates .
patient 1 was a 10-yr - old boy originally diagnosed with left hemispheric atrophy and an ipsilateral parietotemporooccipital porencephalic cyst .
our findings , along with literature data , suggest that the organization of the epileptogenic substrate in type iiid fcd probably varies along a spectrum including on the one side cases with extensive ictal onset zones and non - satisfactory outcomes following focal resections and on the other side cases with well - localized ictal onsets and engel class i outcomes following tailored resections , even though mri may suggest more extensive and complex pathology . within such complex imaging lesions ,
