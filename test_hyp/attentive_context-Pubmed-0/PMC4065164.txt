sea captured the physics of solvation by 
 presimulating toy spheres in explicit water , collecting a database 
 of structural and energetic properties of those waters and then assembling 
 at run time the solvation physics as sums over appropriate toy spheres 
 to properly represent a given solute . in field - sea , this procedure 
 differs in using a solvation free - energy field , rather than explicit 
 waters .
we have 
 described field - sea , a method for computing solvation free energies 
 of solutes in water .
one of the 
 key observations that arises from our md simulations of charged solutes 
 in tip3p water , which is captured by field - sea , is that atoms that 
 are adjacent to charged atoms in solutes acquire partial characteristics 
 of those charged atoms .
relative to sea , field - sea captures the solvation 
 free energies of ions and charged solutes accurately , is faster to 
 compute , and has no degradation of performance on nonpolar and polar 
 solutes .
furthermore , field - sea uses an adaptive boundary , allowing 
 solvating waters to approach a solute atom to different degrees depending 
 on neighboring atoms .
both sea and field - sea offer advantages over implicit - solvent 
 modeling in that they entail no adjustable solute atom radii parameters .
