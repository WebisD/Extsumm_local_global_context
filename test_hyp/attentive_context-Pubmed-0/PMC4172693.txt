we have used probiotic culture fractions stimulated with other inactivated bacterial cultures , to mimic the interspecies interactions established in the intestinal mucosa . in order to include both probiotic and stimulating bacterial culture components found in the final fractions ,
our results , similar to other scientific studies , demonstrate that inactivated soluble and cellular fractions of probiotic cultures , whose composition can be influenced by the stimulation with other microbial species , could induce immunomodulatory effects mediated by cytokines .
the induction of tnf- synthesis by probiotic bacteria , observed in many other studies ( 28 ) seems to be necessary in order to establish functional connections between intestinal epithelial cells and the immune cells ( b cells , dendritic cells , macrophages ) from the lamina propria .
being the dominant cytokine involved in the maturation of cd t cells , il-12 plays an important role in immunomodulation , its synthesis being an essential process in triggering early cytokine cascade activation as a response to adjuvants ( 42 ) . in the case of tnf synthesis ,
these aspects suggest that b. cereus and e. coli strains stimulate the synthesis and accumulation in the probiotic cultures sn of bacterial molecules potentially involved in the activation of mucosal intestinal cells , such as macrophages or dendritic cells , to synthesize il-12 . however , it is to be noticed that the unstimulated fractions , particularly cs and sn , also induced high levels of il-12 , especially at 7 and 14 days after the first administration .
