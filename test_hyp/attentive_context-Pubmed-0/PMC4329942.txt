moreover , we induced oxidative dna damage in those pbmcs by incubating them with hydrogen peroxide , measured the kinetics of removing of such damage , and compared the results between the patients and the controls .
for the first time , we showed that patients with depression had elevated levels of dna breaks , alkali - labile sites , and oxidative dna damage , and that these lesions may be accumulated by impairments of dna repair pathways .
there is a need for further studies to define the role of nuclear and mitochondrial dna damage and repair in people with depression , and their implications for clinical outcome .
elucidation of those molecular factors and mechanisms may be helpful in development of new methods for diagnosing depression in the future . to achieve these objectives , we measured and compared the extent of endogenous dna damage  single- and double - strand breaks , alkali - labile sites , and oxidative damage of the pyrimidines and purines  in pbmcs isolated from dd patients and healthy controls .
moreover , we showed , using modified comet assay with hogg1 and nth , that the patients in comparison to the controls had elevated levels of oxidative dna damage , particularly oxidative modifications of the purines and pyrimidines ( figure 2 ) .
