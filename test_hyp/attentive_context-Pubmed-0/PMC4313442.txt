the aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of aging on saccular function using cvemp response . 

sixty - two subjects were including , 31 young adults ( 62 ears ) with a mean age of 22.15  1.93yr ( range : 19 - 26yr ) comprising 27 females and 4 males as control group , and 31 old adults ( 50 ears ) with a mean age of 69.76  5.14yr ( over age 60 ) comprising 26 females and 5 males , as test group .
the cvemp response threshold , latency ( especially p1 ) , and asymmetry ratio of p1/n1amplitude increased , while the p1/n1amplitude decreased .
vemp abnormalities observed in healthy older adults indicated the sensitivity of this test in identifying the first signs of vestibular dysfunction .
the vemp responses revealed that 23 participants had bilateral vemp response and 4 participants had unilateral vemp response ( in 112 of 124 ears in the 62 participants ) .
the independent t - test showed a significant difference in p1/n1 amplitude ( p<0.001 ) , and asymmetry ratio of p1/n1 amplitude showed a significant difference between the two groups ( p=0.01 ) .

 to examine the effect of aging on saccular function , cvemp results for the older group were compared with the controls .
