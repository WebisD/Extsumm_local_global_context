the outcome of both genetic and epigenetic modifications is an aberrant overexpression and/or silencing of genes implicated in cell proliferation and/or in the control of cell death .
all of these results provide strong evidence that estrogen target gene expression is tightly regulated by multiple and highly dynamic machineries implicating ers , coactivators and corepressors in a classical and epigenetic manner .
breast cancer ( bc ) is the most common malignant tumor among women in the world and is the second cause of death in women between the ages of 3555 in developed countries .
recently , a dynamic process of dna methylation was also reported to be involved in the control of the cyclic expression of er target genes .
epigenetic pathways regulate gene transcription by two different mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive : dna methylation and post - translational modification of histones .
bc can be divided based on molecular criteria into distinct phenotypes : the molecular subtypes are classified by ( 1 ) expression of estrogen receptors ( ers ) and/or progesterone receptors ( prs ) , ( 2 ) human epidermal receptor 2 ( her2/erbb2 ) amplification and ( 3 ) a triple negative type ( er / pr and normal expression of her2 ) . while estrogen has normal biological roles , such as reproduction , brain development and additional protective effects of sexual steroid hormones , prolonged exposure , combined with high levels of hormone increases the risk of bc by constitutively activating the transcription of genes predominantly implicated in metabolism and cell cycle regulation .
