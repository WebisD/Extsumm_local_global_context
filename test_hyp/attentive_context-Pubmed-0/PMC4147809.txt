the purpose of this study was to evaluate if 0.5 mg / kg midazolam via the oral - transmucosal route is efficacious in significantly reducing the child 's anxiety at different procedural steps of a class ii restorative procedure compared with placebo , as measured by the venham 's clinical anxiety scale .
from the above discussion of this study , it can be concluded that midazolam via the oral - transmucosal route in a dose of 0.5 mg / kg is an effective anxiolytic drug or sedative agent for successful accomplishment of a moderate time duration procedure like a class ii restoration ( approximately 30 min ) .
midazolam was seen to relax the child and improve his disposition , showing a synergistic effect with bmts , as it becomes easier to manipulate and coax children under sedative effect into accepting more difficult procedural steps and thus increasing the chances of a successful treatment .
the children were randomly divided into experimental and control groups comprising of 20 children each , using block randomization technique .
in the steps that followed , that is , la and rda , the decrease in anxiety was found to be of a greater degree in group ii than in group i ( p > 0.1 ) .
