we herein report a rare case of subaortic stenosis in association with a previous tof surgical repair that was not considered to be a differential diagnosis .
a 29-year - old woman presented for a routine check - up of surgically corrected congenital heart disease . at 7 years of age , she had undergone surgical repair of tof with excision of the infundibular stenosis and closure of a 10-mm ventricular septal defect .
discrete subaortic stenosis is generally thought of as a disease of children or young adults ( < 25 years of age ) and is thus rarely reported in subjects older than 25 years , particularly in association with tof .
tetralogy of fallot ( tof ) accounts for approximately 5% to 7% of all cases of congenital heart disease .
residual rv outflow tract obstruction with accompanying pulmonary regurgitation is the most frequently reported sequela after initial surgical correction of tof .
subaortic stenosis is strongly associated with other congenital heart defects ; however , subaortic stenosis in association with tof , especially in women , is extremely rare . according to a medline database review of the last 30 years
therefore , periodic performance of echocardiography should be kept in mind during follow - up of patients with surgically corrected tof .
