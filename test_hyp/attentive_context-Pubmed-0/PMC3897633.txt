endoscopic ablation of a puv is the current gold standard of therapy , but approximately 10% to 30% of patients require a second procedure to achieve satisfactory valve ablation [ 3,6 - 8 ] . as animal models have proven , even partial outlet obstruction can lead to structural and functional deterioration in the detrusor muscle and bladder if the obstruction is not released soon enough [ 9 - 11 ] , which indicates the need for close follow - up after valve ablation . although studies about prognostic factors for outcome of renal function after puv ablation are available [ 8,12 - 15 ] , to date , the effects of preoperative factors on the rate of residual valves have not been precisely addressed . in this study , therefore , we sought to evaluate any possible relationship between preoperative clinical and imaging findings of patients with puv and remnant leaflets after their valve ablation to identify high - risk patients and achieve purposive follow - up .
younger age at surgery time , hyperechogenicity of the renal parenchyma , presence of vur , and grade of reflux before surgery in our patients had a significant relationship with residual valves , but more research is needed to confirm these results .
