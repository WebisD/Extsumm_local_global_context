geoffrey rose 's strategy of preventive medicine made an important theoretical contribution to public health and has applications to transportation .
transportation planning and public health have important historical roots . to address common challenges , including road traffic fatalities , integration of theories and methods from both disciplines is required .
there is ongoing debate in the transportation planning literature that this type of intervention may have limited effectiveness in reducing road fatalities   .
