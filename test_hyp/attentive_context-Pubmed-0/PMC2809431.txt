, this study supports the possibility that lgi1 might act as tumor suppressor of adenocarcinoma - derived cells , in line with the downregulation of lgi1 reported in barrett's - related adenocarcinomas and with previous studies on glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cells   .
the lethal effect produced by lgi1 expression in hela cells suggests that the proposed role of tumor suppressor might be extended to adenocarcinoma - derived cells .
furthermore lgi1 altered expression of key regulators of apoptosis such as the antiapoptotic b - cell lymphoma 2 gene ( bcl2 ) and of the proapoptotic b - cell lymphoma 2-associated x protein gene ( bax ) .
the aim of this study was to establish whether lgi1 was capable to suppress growth of cancer cells different from glioblastoma and neuroblastoma .
furthermore , these effects on cells of epithelial origin exclude the requirement of interactions with proteins specifically expressed in brain for the ability of lgi1 to contrast cell growth and survival . to gain information on the process of hela cell death caused by the expression of lgi1 we measured the activity of the apoptosis effectors caspase-3 and -7 in the experimental conditions employed to monitor cell death ( figure 4 ) .
