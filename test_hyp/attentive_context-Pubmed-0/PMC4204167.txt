paradoxically , recent researches demonstrated the dark side of nrf2.4 cancer cells acquire a growth advantage by eliminating keap1-mediated negative control of nrf2 , which leads to activation of the nrf2-dependent defense response.4 constitutive upregulation of nrf2 has been found in many types of cancers , including skin , breast , prostate , lung , head and neck , and endometrial cancer.5 overexpressed nrf2 provides a growth advantage for cancer cells by protecting those cells from oxidative stress and anticancer agents , thus contributing to chemoresistance.5 in this review , we summarize the therapeutic development of nrf2 inhibitors that enhance the efficacy of the current cancer treatments .
kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1)-nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) is a major cellular pathway that protect normal cells against oxidative and xenobiotic damage.1 nrf2 is an essential transcription factor for antioxidant and detoxification genes and is crucial for the chemopreventive effect of various phytochemicals against carcinogenesis .
constitutively expressed nrf2 can promote cancer cell proliferation and protect cells against oxidative stress and therapeutic agents .
it must be kept in mind that chemopreventive agents including various phytochemicals can induce chemoresistance and tumor progression by activating the keap1-nrf2 pathway .
