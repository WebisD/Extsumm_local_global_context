furthermore , our data seem to confirm that sustainable power output is related to a given relative intensity ( 24 ) , which is partly reflected in the maintenance of hr within a certain range . finally , because of the reduction in air density associated with cycling in hot ambient conditions , speed was not different between tth-3 and ttc .
the current study is the first to determine the effects of acute heat exposure and heat acclimatization on performance and pacing during outdoor cycling tt in experienced cyclists .
1 ) (  = 0.90 , p < 0.001 ) and showed a large (  = 0.51 ) and significant ( p < 0.001 ) time  condition interaction .
consequently , non  heat - acclimatized cyclists are incapable of sustaining this absolute effort .
indeed , it has been shown that the rise in cardiovascular strain in hot conditions during both constant rate ( 1,36,37 ) and self - paced ( 24 ) exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate .
however , the decrement in power output is partly recovered after 1 wk of heat acclimatization and almost fully restored after 2 wk .
