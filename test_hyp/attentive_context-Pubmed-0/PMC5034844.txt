as tdf / ftc is not recommended for use with unboosted atv because of a drug  drug interaction that results in decreased concentrations of atv , participants in this trial who were randomized to discontinue ritonavir simultaneously switched to a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( nrti ) backbone of abacavir / lamivudine ( abc/3tc ) .
this study , assure ( a 
 simplification study of unboosted reyataz with epzicom ) , investigated the efficacy and safety of discontinuing ritonavir in virologically suppressed participants receiving a regimen of tenofovir / emtricitabine  +  atazanavir / ritonavir ( tdf / ftc  +  atv / r ) , one of the recommended firstline regimens in the dhhs guidelines .
over 48 weeks , discontinuation of ritonavir after switching from a regimen of tdf / ftc  +  atv / r to abc/3tc  +  atv maintained viral suppression in study participants and led to improvements in cd4 cell count , the bone biomarkers pth , bap , ctelopeptide and osteocalcin , and the renal 2m : creatinine ratio .
the improvement in bone markers observed after switching from tdf in our study was not explained by changes in levels of calcium or vitamin d. vitamin d levels at baseline and at week 48 remained within the lower end of the normal range for both treatment groups , and a small decline was noted for these levels in the abc/3tc  +  atv treatment group .
