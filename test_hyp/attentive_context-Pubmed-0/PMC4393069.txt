promising accuracy measures obtained on sumohunt developed by combining these properties with sequence information in the vicinity of target lysine and random - forest based algorithm presented in data mining software weka   have opened new paths for the development of an efficient prediction method .
a prediction model has been developed that assures of robust computational method for highly accurate and specific sumoylation - site prediction .
these amino acid properties were chosen on the basis of their contribution in increasing structural complementarity and association between incoming sumo and target protein .
moreover , the physicochemical properties proposed to be playing crucial role in the appropriate presentation and hence rapid sumoylation of target lysine have brought significant improvement in accuracy measures .
this opens new paths to future work in analyzing the effect of these amino acid properties experimentally .
most importantly , based on the model presented here , it gives the possibility of building a server for prediction of sumoylation sites in relation to the spatial properties of amino acid around them and sequence information .
the major role in sumoylation is played by only few enzymes discussed above ; it suffers from the lack of efficient target recognition and modification systems , thus emphasizing the importance of motif and sequence information on the target protein as a device of recognition in the pathway .   including sequence information as a principal contributor of computational prediction performance can provide rational computational tools , but focusing entirely on the consensus motif is not preferable as it can result in missing many true positives that lie in nonconsensus regions along with high false positive rate due to the many consensus sites that are actually not sumoylated . in view of the occurrence of sumo at both consensus and nonconsensus , sites
