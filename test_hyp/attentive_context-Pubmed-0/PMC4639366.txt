there was no statistically significant difference in the values of cholesterol and triglycerides between tg and cg at the beginning of research ( f=0.459 ; p=0.500 ) of cholesterol and triglycerides was within reference values .
statistically significant change of the mean value of the cholesterol was established by analyzing cholesterol and triglycerides values before and after the treatment in examinees of the cg and tg .
mmol / l that was statistically significant difference between cg and tg ( f=21.614 ; p=0.000 ) .
primary aim was to improve quality of life in patients with peripheral arteriosclerosis , and to compare the change in total amount of blood lipids before and after the conducted program .
percentage share of smokers in tg and cg findings for blood cholesterol and triglycerides were obtained at the beginning of research for each examinee ( table 3 ) .
average values of cholesterol and triglycerides in relation to tg at the beginning and at the end of research
statistically significant change of the average value of the cholesterol was established by analyzing of the cholesterol and triglycerides values before and after the treatment in examinees of the control and test group .
after treatment of physical activity bmi in tg decreased significantly ( f=19.694 , p=0.000 ) compared to cg . at baseline , anamnestic data reviled that 56% of examinees in cg and 54% of examinees in tg consumed cigarettes which was insignificant difference ( =0,040 ; p=0,500 ) ( table 2 ) . at the end point of study ,
