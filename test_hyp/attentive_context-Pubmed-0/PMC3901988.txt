the objective of the present paper is to highlight selected ethnic differences associated with obesity by focusing on factors that contribute to obesity : metabolic syndrome ( ms ) indicators , regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( hpa ) axis , glucocorticoid sensitivity ( gs ) , insulin resistance ( ir ) , and physical activity among aas and caucasians ( cas ) .
the current paper focused on ethnic variations associated with ms indicators , regulation of the hpa axis , ir , gr , and physical activity  all of which are associated with obesity and chronic diseases .
the prevalence of overweight or obesity in african women ( 66% ) is 1.4 times that in caucasian ( ca ) women ( 47% ) , and african american ( aa ) women may be at greatest risk for the health consequences of obesity and have an almost twofold greater risk of developing diabetes and experiencing hypertension at earlier ages ; they also have significantly greater abdominal fat   than ca women .  
the literature is clear in that a dysregulated hpa axis may lead to obesity and is a risk factor for cvd .
approximately 30% of ca adults are obese compared to 45% of aa adults . despite this trend , the most widely used treatments for overweight and obesity in u.s.a are largely ineffective .
