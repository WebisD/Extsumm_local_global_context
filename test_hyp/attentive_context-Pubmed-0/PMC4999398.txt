, we investigated the association of p2x7r rs3751142 and card8 rs2043211 polymorphisms with the susceptibility and clinical manifestations of gout in the male korean population .
however , we found that in a pair - wise comparison of the ca / tt p2x7r and card8 genotype combination was shown to have an increased trend for the risk of gout ( or = 2.618 , p = 0.056 ) . in conclusion , this study provides evidence that the interaction of msu crystal - mediated p2x7r with card8 may be at least in part responsible for the pathogenesis of gout .
rs3751142 ( c > a ) in p2x7r gene and rs2043211(a > t ) in card8 gene . a pair - wise comparison of p2x7r rs3751142 and card8 rs2043211 genotype combinations showed that a trend toward higher risk of gout development was identified in subjects who were heterozygous for the ca p2x7r rs3751142 genotype and recessive homozygous for the tt card8 rs2043211 genotype compared to the cc / aa combination ( p = 0.056 , or = 2.618 , 95% ci 0.975 - 7.031 ) ( table 5 ) .
this study identified that card8 rs2043211 was not associated with increased gout risk , which is in contrast to the known difference of genetic distribution of this snp in the chinese and european gout population ( 67 ) . as far as we know , this study is the first to determine genetic association between the p2x7r snp and gout patients , revealing that p2x7r polymorphism did not increase the risk of gout in our study population .
