there is increasing evidence linking endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress coping responses with the development of diseases .
, we briefly summarize the er stress coping responses , particularly the unfolded protein response ( upr ) , and discuss the potential role of upr as a physiologically relevant pathway in supporting and controlling proper embryonic development .
the er is also closely associated with all cellular organelles , and therefore , capable of driving sophisticated mechanisms of intracellular signaling , including activation of transcriptional processes , ca mobilization , and influencing energy metabolism . in this review
this is not surprising , given that the er is a multifunctional essential organelle in eukaryotic cells ; it functions as the critical entrance to the secretory pathways , and is also a regulator of ca homeostasis , as well as protein and lipid synthesis , all of which are highly sensitive to a variety of environmental , physiological , and pathophysiological conditions .
further identification of er stress - induced coping responses in preimplantation embryos would be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of development from preimplantation through early postimplantation .
various arms of the upr , an er stress coping response , are expressed in oocytes and preimplantation embryos , suggesting that er stress as a normal physiological adaptive / coping mechanism plays a pivotal role in the development of preimplantation embryos . as such , upr - associated molecules and pathways such as sxbp1 mrna may become useful markers for the potential diagnosis of stress conditions for preimplantation embryos .
