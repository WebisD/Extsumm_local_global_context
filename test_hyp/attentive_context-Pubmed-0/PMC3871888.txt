, we report the 
 use of 2d gamma - imaging to quantify tc transport parameters 
 in a simple granular porous media 
 model .
the technique represents 
 a base for development of model systems for noninvasive study of radionuclide 
 migration in complex physicochemical environments , critical to establishing 
 the design specifications and safety case for future gdfs , and also 
 for application to other contaminant transport in the subsurface .
furthermore , we apply this methodology , for the first time , to investigate 
 the feasibility of direct noninvasive quantification of radionuclide 
 migration within opaque cementitious gdf candidate material ( crushed 
 nirex reference vault backfill ( nrvb ) ) under circum - neutral and alkaline ph .
uniform , saturated one - dimensional flow through ottawa quartz 
 sand , as a model test material , is used to demonstrate the ability 
 of gamma imaging to obtain reproducible data sets at the mesoscale 
 ( millimeters to decimeters ) , which can be used to yield transport 
 parameters by fitting standard convection  dispersion models . 

these 
 studies utilized ultratrace concentrations of a gamma - emitting technetium 
 isotope , technetium-99 m ( commonly used in medical and industrial imaging 
 applications ) , to demonstrate qualitatively the immobilization of 
 technetium on fe(ii)-bearing sediments and minerals , via an fe(ii)-mediated 
 reduction of tc(vii ) to tc(iv ) . in this study
