based on several of these features , we developed a series of filter steps and a statistical model that together are able to detect pre - mirnas with a sensitivity of about 0.8 and a specificity of about 0.99 .
we describe our tool , called   novomir , to detect pre - mirna and mirna / mirna * sequences in a plant genome . for this purpose  
thus , the program , which we call   novomir , is well suited to search on a genomic scale for new pre - mirnas that are not necessarily evolutionarily conserved . as an example , we searched with   novomir for pre - mirnas in nontranslated regions of the   a. thaliana genome and detected among the high - scoring sequences experimentally verified pre - mirnas , which were not annotated in the recent version of   mirbase
plant pre - mirnas are more heterogeneous in size and structure than animal pre - mirnas but still show sufficient characteristic features  such as relative thermodynamic stability of their structure , length of helices , and number and size of loops  to be differentiated from other rnas .
jones - rhoades and bartel   search for putative mirna / mirna * complexes in the intergenic regions of   arabidopsis thaliana and filter these according to gc content , mismatches in the stem , conservation in the rice genome , and the characteristic stem - loop structure . to our knowledge ,
