were infected with p. falciparum only , 68 ( 9.1% ) were infected with helminths only , while 124 ( 16.6% ) were coinfected . a higher proportion of women with either organism presented with stillbirth than women with neither infection .
. a higher proportion of women who were single did not receive sp during pregnancy , had fewer than 5 anc visits , had low folate levels , were anemic , had had a prior induced abortion or a prior stillbirth and delivered a stillborn infant compared to their counterparts ( table 1 ) .                  of the 746 women , 407 ( 54.6% ) had neither infection , 147 ( 19.7% )
overall , the mean age of the women was 26.8 years ( range : 15 to 48 years ) ; 21.1% were single , 30.2% were primigravidae , 30.6% were anemic , 29.5% had a prior induced abortion , and 5.2% had a history of stillbirth ( table 1 ) .       
low serum folate , severe anemia , prior induced abortion and prior stillbirth were each strongly , independently associated with stillbirth , with increased odds ranging from over 3-fold to a 6-fold increase ( table 3 ) .
