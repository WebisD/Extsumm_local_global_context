we report a life - threatening pe and its management in a child after radical resection of a kts vascular malformation involving the right calf and adjacent tissues .
klippel  trenaunay syndrome ( kts ) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by venous and lymphatic abnormalities , cutaneous capillary malformations , and hypertrophy of soft tissue and bone .
deep venous thrombosis ( dvt ) with a pulmonary embolism ( pe ) has been described in these patients,1 though children have a lower rate of thromboembolic episodes .
we present a unique management of pe in a child with oxygenation failure and recent major vascular surgery using a catheter extraction technique combined with regional thrombolysis followed by ivc filter placement .
we believe that prompt diagnosis and expertise of hospital staff as well as availability of resources contributed to a good patient outcome in our case .
all patients with kts are at high risk of dvt and pe and may require long term thromboprophylaxis.1,2 anticoagulation is of vital importance in the perioperative setting or in trauma victims with this condition .
our patient developed massive pe despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation with lmwh , which was interrupted only for 24 hours in the immediate peri - operative period .
