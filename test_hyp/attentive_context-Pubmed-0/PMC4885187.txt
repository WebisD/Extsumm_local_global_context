hence , our case demonstrates that nodular hidradenoma is a rare differential diagnosis of skin tumors , even in the pediatric age group .
we describe a young girl , in whom nodular hidradenoma developed at the age of 6 years .
hidradenomas are benign cutaneous tumors of sweat gland origin , with the clear cell type constituting the most frequent histologic variety . usually , they are diagnosed in the elderly population , the peak incidence being the fifth to sixth decade .
a 10-year - old girl presented to us with a swelling on the left thigh , which had been progressively enlarging over the preceding 4 years .
the lesion was present in the lower limb the presence of an unusually large cystic cavity within the tumoral mass , leading to serous discharge , makes our case even more interesting .
however , a case of nodular hidradenoma masquerading as umbilical polyp has been reported in a 1-year - old male child
nodular hidradenoma in the pediatric age group is extremely rare it is usually located over the head , neck , and trunk . in our case ,
our patient was a young girl who presented with a gradually increasing swelling on the lower limb , a site that is unusual for the development of nodular hidradenoma .
