further studies are warranted to resolve the roles of ectophosphatases in host - pathogen interactions , as well as the possible correlations between the expression of these enzymes and the clinical manifestation of the diseases .
the balance of phosphorylation - dephosphorylation of serine , threonine and tyrosine residues modulates signaling pathways critical for determining the outcome of multiple cellular functions .
protein phosphorylation and   dephosphorylation are central events in cell recognition of external and internal signals , leading to specific responses . while protein kinases transfer a phosphate group from atp to a protein ( i.e. , phosphorylate ) , protein phosphatases catalyze the removal of phosphate groups from specific residues of proteins ( i.e. , dephosphorylate )   .
, we describe the role of ectophosphatase activities in host - parasite interactions , particularly ectophosphatases in parasitic protozoa and fungi .
these strategies have brought new perspectives of researches in the areas of biochemistry , physiology , and genetics , providing knowledge about the microorganisms ' life cycles , as well as predicting diagnostic biomarkers , novel drug targets and vaccine candidates against parasitic infections .  
the balance between the antagonistic activities of protein kinases and phosphatases are responsible for many cellular functions , including metabolic pathways , cell - cell communication , proliferation , and gene transcription .
