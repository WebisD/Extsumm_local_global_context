multistate lcmv outbreak , united states , july 2012 : recommendations for trace - back and safe disposal of potentially lcmv - infected mice .
because of the lack of consistent regulation , we recommend that state and federal partners and rodent industry advisory groups work with breeders , distributors , and pet stores to increase awareness of lcmv infection and implement recommended best practices ( table ) to prevent introduction of lcmv into captive rodent populations , prevent subsequent dissemination of potentially infected rodents , and reduce the potential for human exposure and disease among employees and consumers of pet stores and rodent breeding facilities .
wild mice that access captive breeding populations are often the source of infection of captive rodent populations ( 8,11 ) . after being introduced
these captive feeder mice had a wide and complex distribution chain , potentially exposing thousands of persons to lcmv .
no additional human cases were identified after distribution of these mice ; none of the pet store or zoo employees tested had serologic evidence of infection .
although no additional human cases were identified , euthanasia of all potentially infected rodents was recommended to mitigate potential risk .
