one hundred and twenty patients ( 240 eyes ) , who were between the ages of 30 and 45 years ( mean age = 37.3  sd 2.3 years ) and were treated bilaterally with prk for myopia ( mean = 4.5  sd 1.5 d ) were enrolled in this prospective randomized study .
, we found that patients treated with both b - fgf eye drops and l - cysteine oral supplements benefited from more rapid corneal re - epithelialization , which indicates that these two compounds , which act at different subcellular sites , may deliver synergistic effects when used in combination .
all subjects included in the study were randomized into two treatment groups ( group 1 and group 2 ) .
moreover , this combination appeared to be safe on human eyes and more effective than topical b - fgf treatment alone .
complete corneal epithelial resurfacing was achieved starting at day 3 after prk in 57% of the eyes included in the study group ( group 1 ) and in 44% of the eyes in the control group ( group 2 ) . at day four ,
the wound healing response following excimer laser corneal photoablation has been extensively studied at the clinical , microscopic , ultrastructural and immunohistochemical levels , and these findings have provided considerable evidence supporting the close relationship between the structural and the biological wound healing responses of the cornea and the resulting optical clarity and stability of the intended refractive change . in addition , the efficacy of recombinant human b - fgf on epithelial healing has been demonstrated in rabbits after mechanical anterior keratectomy . in this study
