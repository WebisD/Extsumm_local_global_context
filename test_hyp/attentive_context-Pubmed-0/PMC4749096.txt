the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of bitewing radiography , fluorescence laser and visual examination in the diagnosis of incipient occlusal caries in permanent first molars .
the az value for laser method was 0.83 and 0.84 for the first and second examiners , respectively , which shows high efficacy of this method .
although the visual method was not as accurate as lf , considering the insignificant differences and affordability of visual method , the latter can be the first choice for detection of incipient caries . in suspicious cases , radiography and diagnodent
frequency of radiographic scores compared to the standard fissure opening scores according to examiners 1 and 2 all surfaces showing radiolucency in dentine ( score 2 based on table 1 ) were found to have dentin caries ( dentin threshold ) .
sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of caries detection by each examiner ( 1 and 2 ) for all methods ( visual inspection , diagnodent and radiography ) the numbers inside the parentheses are calculated with 95% confidence interval .
this study was conducted on 109 teeth of 31 children aged 7 to 13 ( mean 11.111.34 ) years . after assessment of information compared to the standard method , seven surfaces were sound , 64 showed enamel caries and 38 showed dentin caries .
