possibilities on how tolerance is developed include activation of antigen - specific treg that suppress the diabetogenic phenotype , functional anergy , development of cryptic ( subdominant ) low affinity t cells that block the effector phase of diabetogenic clones , or deviation of cytokine expression in the cognate t cell .
since noninsulin antigens likely contribute to development or expansion of clinical disease and thus represent candidate therapeutic targets for tolerance induction , we have sought and identified cd8 epitopes that may contribute to optimal tolerization in type 1 diabetes .
humoral responses are successfully used clinically to forecast disease susceptibility   , and since adaptive b cell response usually requires t cell help , the presence of reactive ab in patients implies the involvement of cd4 t cells .
study of the nod model has revealed a temporal pattern in development of t cell responses : circulating or islet - infiltrating cd8 t cells reactive to certain antigens are detected at different ages and disease status .
nevertheless , although most experimental immunotherapy trials have been unsuccessful at inducing long - term restoration of regulated insulin secretion , several showed at least partial effects in that the loss of c - peptide is reduced implying enhanced  cell function and a reduced rate of disease progression   . in the nod model where experimental design can be more carefully controlled , several approaches to tolerance induction have showed that tolerance to gad65 and igrp peptide epitopes can be induced in prediabetic mice , but which has little or minimal effect on disease development   .
