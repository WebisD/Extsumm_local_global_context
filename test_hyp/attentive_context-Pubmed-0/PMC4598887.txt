the aim of this study was to evaluate occurrence of bacterial species causing bloodstream infections due to febrile neutropenic episodes in the hematology ward of the university hospital in szeged , hungary , between 2005 and 2008 .
because of the possible presence of unusual pathogens , such as anaerobic bacteria or fastidious microorganisms , the use of various blood culture bottles including anaerobic bottles should be considered . because of its rapid progression of infection in febrile neutropenic patients and difficulties in distinguishing infection from noninfected patients on the basis of clinical presentation in this patient group , the use of empirical antibiotic treatment is essential and may provide the possibility to reach better outcome .
have been developed ; thus , modest increase in the sensitivity of culture has been achieved . in the early 1970s , introducing empiric treatment protocols and antibiotic prophylaxis , increasing use of certain chemotherapeutic drugs associated with frequent oral mucositis , and frequent use of central venous catheters have changed the spectrum of pathogens in febrile neutropenic patients shifting it from gram - negative to gram - positive bacteria , especially viridans group streptococci and coagulase - negative staphylococci   .
between 2005 and 2008 , 469 patients with febrile neutropenia ( 230 females and 239 males , median age 60 years ) were observed in our department with various hematological diseases .
