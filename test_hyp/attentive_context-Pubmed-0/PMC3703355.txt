this is particularly the case of the health of people living in contaminated site(s ) ( cs ) which is affected by the legacy of past industrialization and current industrial activities , often in absence of environmental remediation .
sentieri project is a national project developed to evaluate the health profile of populations residing in the italian sites of national interest for environmental remediation - national priority contaminated sites ( npcs ) .
the sentieri approach is , in its essence , a tool to describe the health profile of residents in npcss to document ascertained or suspected associations with local environmental risks ; it does not require an ad hoc data collection .
other strengths of the sentieri approach are that the a priori evidence evaluation and mortality analysis can be updated ; other health outcomes in addition to mortality can be analyzed , for example , cancer incidence , morbidity , and adverse reproductive effects ; also the a priori evaluation can be carried out for environmental exposures different from the ones in sentieri project . notwithstanding the remarkably laborious activities required to set up a national project such as sentieri
, major benefits in terms of quality and quantity of findings , and a favourable cost / gain balance can be expected inasmuch as this becomes a permanent system of epidemiological observation on health of residents in npcss .
