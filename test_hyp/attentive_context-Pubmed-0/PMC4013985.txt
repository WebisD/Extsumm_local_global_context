the sequence of the exon3 region and locations of polymorphisms we found are shown in 
 fig .
in equine drd4 exon3 region we found two types of polymorphisms , vntr and 
 snps .
in this study we found several novel polymorphisms in equine drd4 exon3 
 region . some of these seem to be breed - specific .
we found that the allele frequency of g292a , which has been reported 
 to be associated with horse personality , was different among breeds .
behavioral tests used in canine studies showing the association between 
 drd4 and behavioral traits   may be useful , following modification , for use 
 with horses . in conclusion , this study showed that there are differences in drd4 
 polymorphisms among breeds of horses .
this suggests that 
 the a allele is a minor allele of horses in general , except for 
 thoroughbreds .
we also compared the allele frequencies of polymorphisms among different breeds . although 
 samples from unrelated individuals are needed to estimate the allele frequency more 
 accurately , it is difficult to collect completely unrelated samples in the case of rare 
 native breeds .
further studies of both functional aspects of genes 
 and behavioral variations are needed to validate the effect of these polymorphisms .
