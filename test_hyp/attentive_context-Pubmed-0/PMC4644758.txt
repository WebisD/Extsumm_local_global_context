we reported the case of an intrathyroid nodule composed mainly of gross fat detected by computed tomography ( ct ) and confirmed by lobectomy as a follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer ( fvptc ) with mature fat .
moreover , fine needle aspiration cytology with gene analysis may be helpful in determining the nature of fatty tumors before surgery .
a 58-year - old woman presented with an incidentally detected mass in the thyroid on routine ultrasonography ( us ) at a primary clinic .
thyroid lesions containing gross fat include heterotopic fat nests , thyrolipoma , teratoma , liposarcoma , and thyroid cancers of the papillary or follicular type ( 234567 ) .
most of these cases are only described upon obtaining pathological data after surgery ; radiologic methods are of limited use ( 89 ) . with the approval of the institutional review board of our hospital ,
fvptc should be included in the differential diagnosis of fat - containing focal lesions in the thyroid , in addition to thyrolipoma , teratoma , liposarcoma , and small focal fat nests near the capsule .
in our case , the tumor was a yellowish , homogeneous , and well - demarcated nodular lesion on gross examination , with negative value of attenuation on ct , suggesting fat .
