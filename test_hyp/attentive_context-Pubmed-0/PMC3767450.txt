in conclusion , we have synthesized new ligand 5-(diethylamino)-2-(5-nitro-1h - benzimidazol-2-yl)phenol and their metal complexes . these novel compounds were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against e. coli and s. aureus strains as well as for antifungal activity against c. albicans and a. niger strains using serial dilution technique .
several derivatives are reported in literature for the synthesis of benzimidazole - metal complexes for fluorescent probes and bioorganic application , but antimicrobial activities of these classes of compounds have received little attention . in the literature , there are no reports available describing synthesis and antimicrobial activities of metal complexes of 5-(diethylamino)-2-(5-nitro-1h - benzimidazol-2-yl)phenol . in this paper , we have synthesized novel ligand 5-(diethylamino)-2-(5-nitro-1h - benzimidazol-2-yl)phenol and its metal complexes and studied their antimicrobial activities .
cyclic voltammetric studies of the ligand 3 and complexe 4a4d in dimethyl formamide solution under nitrogen atmosphere are irreversible .
the result of cyclic voltammetry of ligand closely resembles with that of metal complexes compounds , which serve as further evidences for similar structural and electronic properties figure 4 .
each plate had a set of controls : a column with a broad - spectrum antibiotic as positive control , a column with all solutions with the exception of the test compound , and a column with all solutions with the exception of the bacterial solution , adding 10  l of nutrient broth instead .
