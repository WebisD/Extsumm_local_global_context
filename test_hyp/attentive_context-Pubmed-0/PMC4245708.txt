the early angiosperms underwent a remarkably rapid diversification and have since reached ecological domination in the plant kingdom in terms of number of species ( > 300,000 ) a phenomenon that charles darwin referred to as  the abominable mystery  . because a radial style is necessary to facilitate efficient fertilization , radialization of the style may have been a key event in allowing the success of flowering plants .
excellent progress has been made in understanding how auxin provides polarity and identity to cells in a range of developmental contexts .
the radial style is a general feature of the female reproductive organ in angiosperms , which arose during the cretaceous period 100125 million years ago .
this activity leads to an unusual developmental bilateral - to - radial symmetry transition in the arabidopsis style .
the transition is from radial to bilateral symmetry and controlled by hox and decapentaplegic genes in animals   .
kluh ( klu ) is a margin - identity gene expressed in peripheral cells of arabidopsis petals and in the marginal tissue of the gynoecium .
in fact , the echinoderms provide the only reported example in which this order is reversed such that the radially symmetric animal develops from a bilaterally symmetric larvae stage   . in the model plant
