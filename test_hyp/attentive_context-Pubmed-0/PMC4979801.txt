the mortality of severe dengue patients admitted to the icu remains high , and the mortality was associated with lower gcs scores , lower platelet count before being discharged from the icu discharge , and more organ failures . in addition , a significant portion of patients with severe dengue who die in the icu have bacterial infections .
a large outbreak of dengue infections caused by dengue serotype 2 developed in tainan , taiwan , and a significant portion of patients with severe dengue infections required intensive care unit ( icu ) admission . because the outcomes of adult patients with dengue infections requiring icu admissions have rarely been investigated , we did this retrospective study to assess the clinical manifestations and the prognostic factors of patients critically ill with severe dengue infections .
there were no significant differences in the symptoms , the overall icu 7.8 ( 10.3 ) and hospital - stay 14.7 ( 16.1 ) days , or hospital costs between survivors and patients who died .
in addition , the predictors of icu mortality by multiple logistic regression analysis should be considered as the association with mortality but not the biological causes of death . finally , despite several reports showed the association between different medications , such as n - acetyl cysteine , factor vii , diuretic , and fluid administration , and the outcome of dengue patients
