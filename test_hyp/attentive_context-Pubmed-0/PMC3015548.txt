thus , the entire defect is completely circumscribed with the laparoscopic technique . the surgical technique described for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair varies by surgeon
we present 3 patients who underwent laparoscopic repair of a ventral hernia in which two 5-mm ports were used .
laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is a procedure that has gained acceptance among surgeons and patients over the last 5 years to 10 years
between july 2002 and january of 2003 , 3 patients underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with mesh in which only two 5-mm ports were used for small incisional or ventral hernias .

this technique offers all the advantages inherent to laparoscopic surgery , with the added benefit of the use of only two 5-mm ports .
follow - up surveillance for complications and hernia recurrence was performed in the immediate postoperative period , 1 week to 2 weeks after surgery .
in addition , the intraperitoneal repair performed laparoscopically poses a significant mechanical advantage and is associated with less recurrence .
this technique can be done on an outpatient basis in a safe , timely fashion .
