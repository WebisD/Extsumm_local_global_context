the purpose of the study is ( a ) to identify the incidence of each lower extremity alignment deformity and identify the relationship of the incidence between the deformities and ( b ) to identify the effects of physical characteristics ( weight , height , age , and gender ) and residence styles ( sitting - on and standing - up life styles ) on the development of 8 lower extremity deformities ( genu valgus , genu varus , genu recurvatum , heel valgus , heel varus , tibial torsion , femoral torsion , and leg length discrepancy ) .
for men , the results of incidence of lower extremity deformity according to the life style showed that the incidence of genu varus was significantly high in standing - up life style compared to sitting - on life style ( chi - square=8.28 ; p=0.004 ) . however , the incidences of heel varus ( chi - square=13.223 ; p=0.004 ) and femoral torsion ( chi - square=19.347 ; p<0.0001 ) were significantly high in sitting - on life style than standing - up life style . for women , the incidences of genu varus ( chi - square=24.18 , p<0.0001 ) , heel varus ( chi - square=15.412 , p<0.0001 ) , and tibial torsion ( chi - square = 6.285 ; p<0.012 ) were significantly high in sitting - on life style compared to standing - up life style ( p<0.05 ) . the odd ratio result for lower extremity deformities for men and women between the life styles are shown in table 3 . for men , the odd ratio result for sitting - on life style against standing - up life style showed 6.6 times significantly high relationship in femoral torsion ( 95% confidence range [ ci ] , 1.6426.47 ) in men . for women ,
