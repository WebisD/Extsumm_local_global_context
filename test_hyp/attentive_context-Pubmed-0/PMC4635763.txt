this case report shares our experience with a rare case of cardiac myxoma with concurrent stroke and st - elevation myocardial infarction with normal coronary angiography .
we present a case of a patient with results of cardiac catheterization that are incompatible with st segment elevation and elevated cardiac enzymes .
stroke is a complication in 10% to 30% of cardiac myxoma patients as found in a case series spanning 20 years in belgium and a 11-year series conducted at the mayo clinic ; no cases of cardiac myxoma in either study had concurrent myocardial infarction .
forty cases of myxoma - related myocardial infarction were recorded in a systematic review of published data spanning 32 years .
once diagnosed , cardiac myxoma requires timely surgical en bloc resection to avoid deterioration resulting from worsening embolism or obstruction .
although cardiac myxomas are relatively uncommon compared with coronary and valve lesions in the elderly , they are easily diagnosed by basic echocardiography ; this diagnostic test may be the key to solving puzzling presentations and should a part of most cardiac workups .
in addition , this experience is a reminder for clinicians to include cardiac myxoma in the differential diagnosis list and to manage it timely if found .
