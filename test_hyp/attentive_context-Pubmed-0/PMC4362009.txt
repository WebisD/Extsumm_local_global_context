we report an eus - assisted retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy performed in a patient who had developed enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes with an unknown cause .
our experience suggests that this is an alternative and minimally invasive approach for the biopsy of retroperitoneal lymph nodes .
in spite of the relatively high accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound - assisted fine - needle aspiration ( eus - fna ) in diagnosing lymphomas , inadequate sampling by eus - fna often makes it difficult to perform immunohistochemical analysis , thus limiting its application in the classification of lymphoma .
natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( notes ) is a surgical technique by which procedures such as exploration , biopsy , organ resection , and anastomosis can be performed using an endoscope passed through a natural orifice [ such as the mouth , stomach , colon ( or rectum ) , vagina , bladder , or esophagus ] and then entered into the abdominal cavity , mediastinum , or thoracic cavity through an internal incision .
a 60-year - old male patient was admitted to our hospital complaining of epigastric discomfort , which had persisted for 1 month . a computerized tomography ( ct ) scan suggested the presence of multiple soft - tissue density masses in the patient 's abdominal cavity , the largest of which was 7.7 cm  7.2 cm [ figure 1a and b ] .
