, we describe a chinese han child who presented with isolated hyperpigmentation at birth and a homozygous splice mutation ( c.106  +  1delg ) in mrap .
familial glucocorticoid deficiency ( fgd ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from adrenal unresponsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) .
we report a case of fgd with homozygous mutation of mrap in a chinese han neonate .
, this mutation has not been reported in chinese han cases of fgd . in the current paper
the patient was the offspring of non - consanguineous parents and her sibling had died in the neonatal period , possibly due to glucocorticoid insufficiency .
further studies describing new cases and mutations causing fgd will contribute to understanding the mechanism of this rare and potentially life - threatening disease .
prolonged acth excess or glucocorticoid deficiency increases linear growth , while early diagnosis and appropriate therapy in this case enabled the patient to achieve normal developmental milestones .
, a custom panel - based next - generation sequencing approach has been used to sequence all known adrenal gland diseases - associated genes in this child .
, our patient is the first reported chinese han patient with fgd type 2 , with a known mrap mutation .
