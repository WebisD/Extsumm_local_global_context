an accurate diagnosis and early intervention are required to prevent the deadly complications of orbital cellulitis .
thickening of lps - sr complex in our case suggests myositis of lps , which was responsible for persistence of ptosis .
after a thorough search of scientific literature , we could find only one case of orbital cellulitis caused by s. faecalis , reported by biedner et al . in 1986 .
a 10-year - old asian indian male child was brought to the emergency services of our tertiary care hospital with progressive bulging of the left eye for the past 7 days .
this is especially important , like in our case , where the causative agent was an unusual one and would not have responded to the empirical therapy .
they reported a 2.5-month - old female who was hospitalized with septicemia , ethmoiditis , and orbital cellulitis and was managed with intravenous ampicillin . unlike the earlier reported case , our patient was healthy with no history of admission to a hospital .
the material obtained from abscess drainage should be handled properly and sent for microbiological examination to identify the causative organism and sensitivity .
chaudhry et al . in their review of 218 patients of orbital cellulitis reported 4 patients with persistent ptosis after resolution of orbital cellulitis and found delayed intervention to be the common factor . in our case , precise treatment was delayed for about 10 days pending the microbiological confirmation of the causative agent .
