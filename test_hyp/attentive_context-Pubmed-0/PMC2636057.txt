incidence of pdr with and without csme was 
 significantly high in the age group 41 to 55 years ( p 0.05 ) and 
 also regression of pdr with prp ( p 0.001 ) [ table 2 ] .
incidence of pdr was significantly high in type i dm ( p 
 0.001 ) and was observed to increase with duration of dm ( p 
 0.001 ) [ table 1 ] .
indications 
 for vitreo retinal surgery were significantly higher in type i dm 
 ( p 0.01 ) , irrespective of age and duration of dm [ table 3 ] .

 pdr such as disc pallor , ghost vessels and reduced venous 
 dilatation were present in only 39 out of 74 cases .
twenty - six eyes required further prp or other adjunctive

 improvement of two lines or more was observed in 34 eyes , 
 stabilization of visual acuity in 11 eyes and drop of visual acuity 
 by one line or more in 12 eyes . sixteen out of these 74 eyes 
 required to undergo vitreo retinal surgery within a period of one
