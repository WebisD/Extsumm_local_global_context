the results of another performance evaluation of the pilot tests showed that the proposed environment could successfully transform collaboration data with stable delivering times through network .  
in this paper , we propose a new collaborative molecular modeling environment to connect different modeling systems based on an approach with a collaborative tunneling service and transformation strategies . with our approach ,
the environment consists of two collaborative systems , vrmms ( virtual reality molecular modeling system )   and co - coot .
a networked virtual environment ( nve ) is a computer - supported collaborative work ( cscw ) environment where multiple participants can interact with each other through computer networks for enhancing performances of their collaborations . since
since the biologists can use their favorite systems with their designated roles , the proposed environment provides with a tunneling service for integrating the different collaborative applications .
therefore , real - time collaborations of the participating biologists using nve systems are not smoothly realized in general .   in this paper , we propose a collaborative experiment environment with different molecular modeling systems .
a 3d biomolecular modeling system is one of promising collaborative applications , and it has also been popularly researched and developed by various research groups . in order to design new materials and new drugs , we need to understand functions of proteins through analysis of a 3d protein structure at atomic resolution . first , it is generally determined by x - ray crystallography or nmr .
