herein , we describe the positive margin rates of two non - fellowship trained private practice urologists who converted from open radical retropubic prostatectomy to robot - assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy .
the overall positive margin rate and pt2 positive margin rate for surgeon 1 dropped from 44 to 20% and from 37 to 5.7% , respectively , after changing from open to robotic prostatectomy .
