mabs will continue to track the progress of antibody therapeutics in clinical study throughout 2013 , and we look forward to reporting on results that may be released during the year in  which are the antibodies to watch in 2014 ?
the efficacy and safety of induction and four maintenance regimens of brodalumab compared with placebo and ustekinumab in patients with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis is being evaluated .
the number of anti - cancer mabs at phase 3 is likely to increase in the next 35 y as more adcs move into and through the clinical pipeline . 

historically , ~50% of mabs in the commercial clinical pipeline have been studied as cancer agents ; however , ~67% of the current cohort of mabs at phase 3 is in studies for non - cancer indications ( table 1 ) .
the mabs are being developed as treatments for immunological disorders such as ra , sle , ms and psoriasis , but also for hypercholesterolemia , cachexia and alzheimer disease . reflecting the overall greater challenge of demonstrating safety and efficacy in cancers ,
initiated in december 2012 , nct01722331 is a 64-week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety / tolerability of sc administration of tildrakizumab in patients with moderate - to - severe chronic plaque psoriasis .
