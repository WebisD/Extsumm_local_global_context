therefore , the purpose of this study was to investigate the muscle 
 activates of drivers with post - stoke hemiplegia while driving using a steering wheel and a 
 spinner knob , and compare them with those of non - disabled drivers .
while 10 participants were originally selected for this study , a total of nine drivers 
 participated in this experiment : five drivers with post - stroke hemiplegia ( experimental 
 group ) and four non - disabled drivers ( control group ) .
this study was conducted with 3 males and 2 females 
 in the experimental group and 3 males and 1 female in the control group .
the aim of this study was to investigate and compare muscle activation 
 differences between using a spinner knob and a steering wheel in drivers with post - stroke 
 hemiplegia and non - disabled drivers .
the results of this study indicate that a spinner knob requires less 
 activation of the main muscles than a steering wheel , especially in drivers who have had a 
 stroke .
activation 
 of the biceps brachii while turning the vehicle to the right with the spinner knob was 
 significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group ( table 1table 1.muscle activation during left and right turns made with a spinner knob and a
