a 55-year - old male patient developed sudden loss of vision in the right eye following sirsasana with wall support ( 2 minutes ) without supervision .
sirsasana is known to cause elevation of iop , which reverts to normal after cessation of the same.  a sudden variation in iop has decompression effect on the eye , as after antiglaucoma surgery , causing decompression retinopathy .
hence , both the above , in a case of pulmonary embolism , would have predisposed our patient to crvo .
2 ] confirmed findings of ischemic crvo with cilioretinal artery occlusion ( red free photos showed retinal whitening along the course of cilioretinal artery in the maculopapillary region and non - filling of the cilioretinal artery in the early phase of angiogram ) all systemic investigations ( hemoglobin , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , lipid profile , blood sugar , serum homocysteine levels ) were normal , and international normalization ratio ( inr ) was 2.0 . over 6 months follow - up , the patient developed neovascularization of the iris and received pan - retinal laser photocoagulation with no improvement in vision .
this is an advanced pose and should be attempted after practicing forward and backward bends ( asanas ) , under the supervision of a qualified yoga instructor .
