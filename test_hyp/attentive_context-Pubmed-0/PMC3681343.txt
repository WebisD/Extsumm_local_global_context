gfr : glomerular filtration rate ; hrs : hepatorenal syndrome ; meld : model for end - stage liver disease .
hyperkinetic state and vasodilatation worsen in parallel with the deterioration in liver function . in patients with end - stage cirrhosis ,
therefore , another issue is to better identify the subgroup of hrs patients who are likely to rapidly develop end - stage renal failure after transplantation .
a challenging issue is to determine more accurately the potential for improvement with liver transplantation alone , by reversing hyperkinetic state , in order to better identify those who need a combined liver and kidney transplantation and those who do not . in theory , hrs is a functional disorder that is fully reversible with liver transplantation .
cirrhosis is characterized by circulatory changes corresponding to a hyperkinetic state with arterial vasodilatation , decreased systemic vascular resistance , and increased cardiac output .
this classification is also more appropriate to identify any kind of kidney injury within a wide spectrum of causes of acute , chronic , and acute - on - chronic kidney diseases in cirrhosis .
the group proposed the term ' hepatorenal disorder ' to define any kind of kidney disease that is functional or structural in nature in patients with cirrhosis .
