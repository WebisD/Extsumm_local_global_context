we describe a young male who developed mania while on amisulpride , a newer antipsychotic drug introduced in india .
a 18-year - old unmarried hindu male presented with a history suggestive of schizophrenia for the last 2 years .
there are reports of amisulpride being used for the management of bipolar disorders . however , there are very few reports of mania induced by amisulpride . here
it is an unusual " atypical " antipsychotic , as the " atypical " profile of the new antipsychotics clozapine , olanzapine , quetiapine , and risperidone has been linked to combined antagonism of serotonin 2 ( 5-ht2 ) and dopamine 2 ( d2 ) receptors , whereas amisulpride has negligible affinity for 5 ht2 receptors and is specific for dopamine d2 and d3 receptors in the limbic rather than striatal structures .
to the best of our knowledge of mania due to first amisulpride was reported by murphy in 2003 . however , in the case described by murphy , the patient was also on citalopram , an antidepressant , though its discontinuation did not led to improvement in manic symptoms .
this is also important because of the fact that atypical antipsychotic drugs ( including amisulpride ) are used for the treatment for bipolar disorder .
