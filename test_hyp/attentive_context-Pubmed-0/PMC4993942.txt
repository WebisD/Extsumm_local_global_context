to the best of our knowledge , no other study has compared these two laser modalities in changing choroidal or central retinal thickness . in this study , we have evaluated the subfoveal choroidal , central retinal , and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) thickness changes before and after prp using edi - oct and we compare the green and red laser in this regard .
nonetheless , this study showed significant increase of subfoveal choroidal , foveal retinal , and peripapillary rnfl thickness after red and green laser prp and no significant difference between these two lasers in aforementioned measurements .
in green laser group , the mean central retinal thickness was 267.0  36.9 micron at baseline and 306.4  73.3 micron at week 6 of follow - up , ( p value 0.000 for both groups ) .
according to early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study ( etdrs ) , protocol panretinal photocoagulation ( prp ) can prevent severe visual loss in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( pdr ) .
the mean subfoveal ct increased significantly in each group at 6 weeks follow - up ( in red laser group , 202.14  24.5 micron at baseline and 211.7  26.6 micron at 6 weeks , p value < 0.00 , showing 4.86% ct increase compared to baseline ) ( in green group , 201.9  21.13 micron at baseline and 208.9  25.0 at 6 weeks , p  value <
