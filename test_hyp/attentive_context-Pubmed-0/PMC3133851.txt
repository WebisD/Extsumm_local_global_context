, the isolectins cramol 1,4 were radiolabeled with tc-99 m for the evaluation of the biodistribution and in order to forecast a possible use as radiopharmaceutical in healing process .
scintigraphy imaging provides a dimensional method for exactly locating gamma emitters in a noninvasive procedure under in vivo conditions . for the characterization of drugs , and biomolecules , molecular imaging techniques are extremely helpful to follow biodistribution in experimental animal studies . in this study
it also showed that the nuclear technique can be very helpful for the development of drugs and medicines .
the radiolabeling of the cramol showed that this lectin has an uncommon behavior specially related to the clearance mechanism that we believe must be more studied .
, the results showed that the acetone can be used for this purpose . in a triplicate test ,
however , the rate between the bowel and the kidney is over the double . in this case , the clearance time would be reduced and the reabsorption of the drug could be facilitated by the microvilli of the bowel . in this case  
then , animals were sacrificed , their were organs removed and weighted , and the radioactivity uptake was counted in a gamma counter ( packard - cobra ii ) .
