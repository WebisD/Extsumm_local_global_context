, we attempted to establish a subline from p19cl6 cells , and accordingly , we could introduce a new subline of cells , that is , p19cl6-a1 cells , that could efficiently and stably differentiate into cardiomyocytes by a differentiation method based on the double stimulation method with many modifications .   in the present study
this feature may prove to be quite suitable for oscillated rhythm analysis based on moving images , and accordingly , we used this software to successfully display the increase in the cardiomyocyte beating rates on correlograms and dose - response curves on treatment with serially diluted cardiotonic reagents .  
, we also introduce a software program , visorhythm , which can analyze the temporal variations in the beating rhythms on moving images and chart correlograms displaying the oscillated rhythms on a windows computer .   because the spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes differentiated from p19cl6-a1 cells form large cell clusters , their contractions are large and strong .  
these indicate that a combination of p19cl6-a1 cells and visorhythm is a useful tool that can provide invaluable assistance in inotropic drug discovery , drug screening , and toxicity testing .
, we examined the expression of the cardiac - specific transcription factors , gata4 and nkx2 - 5 , and of the cardiac - specific myosin heavy chain , -mhc , by rt - pcr on the respective cells with the respective differentiation protocols listed in table 1 on days 0 , 3 , 7 , and 16 .
