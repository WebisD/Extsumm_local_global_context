in summery , the present study demonstrated a promising effect of ivb in the treatment of refractory csc ; however , we can not make specific treatment recommendations based on this small , uncontrolled case series .
five eyes of 5 patients with diagnosis of refractory csc ( lasting more than 1 year ) were included in this study .
diagnosis was made by the history of recurrent blurred vision and metamorphopsia for more than one year , detection of neurosensory detachment in ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , and observation of active rpe leakage in flourscein angiography .
however , they injected 2.5 mg ivb and included cases with history of decreased visual acuity more than 3 months , recurrent episodes of csc or even acute cases with excessive discomfort about visual acuity . in a case
all patients underwent a through ophthalmic examination 1 day , 1 week , and 1 , 2 , and 6 months after the injection .
none of the eyes had intraocular pressure rise ( > 21 mmhg ) or cataract progression during the follow - up period .
central macular thickness decreased significantly from 370  65 m at baseline to 210  24 m at 6 months after injections ( p = 0.009 ) ( table 2 ) .
