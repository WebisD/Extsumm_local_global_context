in the studied sample of postmenopausal women from mendoza , argentina , the ost showed a performance comparable to that reported for european and us white women .
the overall performance of the ost was adequate for a clinical screening method simple enough to be used both by patients and physicians .
, the performance of the ost in a sample of postmenopausal women from western argentina was assessed .
if women with an ost score of 2 or lower are considered at high risk , and those above 2 are deemed at low risk , the unadjusted odds ratio for a diagnosis of osteoporosis by dxa of the high risk group versus the low risk group is 4.06 ( ci95 3.51 to 4.71 ) .  
, the sensitivity of the ost for prediction of t - scores at 2.5 or below for any region ( lumbar spine , femoral neck , or total hip ) has a median of 86% ( range of 53% to 95% ) in white women and 82% ( range 79% to 82% ) in asian women . in the present study , using a cut - off value of 2 , the sensitivity in argentinian women was 83.7% , which is intermediate between the medians for white and asian women . on the other hand ,
