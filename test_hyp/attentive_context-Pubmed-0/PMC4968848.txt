up to 78% of patients welcome the idea of a compliance aid to assist in eyedrop administration.21 the ueb differs from other compliance aids in that it allows patients to place eyedrops without reclining their head .
( irb)-approved study with a small cohort of patients , the original device was tested for feasibility of use and to gather feedback .
more than half of the participants had visual acuity better than 20/40 in at least one eye , and 85% of the participants in the study had been using eyedrops for more than 1 year . as shown in table 2 , the time required to instill drops with the ueb was shorter than with the conventional bottle in all three trials , with statistical significance in the last two trials . as noted in table 3
the mcnemar s test for difference in paired proportions was used to test the difference between bottle types for the outcomes of accuracy , excess drop use , and contamination of the bottle . for all comparisons ,
while the ueb does not improve accuracy of drop placement , it does lead to less drop wastage and less bottle contamination
in total , 40 participants were enrolled in this study . as illustrated in table 1 , the average age of participants was 72.4  8.9 years , with the majority of participants being female and right - handed .
