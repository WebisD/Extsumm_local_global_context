we also evaluated its association with biochemical recurrence - free survival of patients with prostate cancer in order to analyze its potential as a biomarker in this disease .
however , no protocadherin8 methylation was found in the controls , and the difference between prostate cancer cases and controls was statistically significant ( p<0.0001 ) .
promoter methylation of protocadherin8 is a frequent event in prostate cancer , and is associated with traditional risk factors of poor prognosis and shorter biochemical recurrence - free survival time .
the present results indicate that protocadherin8 methylation is an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence - free survival in prostate cancer patients .
protocadherin8 methylation was significantly associated with advanced pathologic stage ( p=0.0122 ) , higher level of preoperative psa ( p=0.0004 ) , higher gleason score , ( p=0.0187 ) , positive lymph node metastasis ( p=0.0314 ) , and biochemical recurrence ( p<0.0001 ) .
moreover , when we analyzed the association between protocadherin8 methylation and traditional clinicopathologic features in prostate cancer , we found that protocadherin8 methylation was significantly correlated with advanced pathologic stage , higher level of preoperative psa , higher gleason score , positive lymph node metastasis , and the occurrence of biochemical recurrence .
