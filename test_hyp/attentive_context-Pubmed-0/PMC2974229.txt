mr imaging of the liver in wilson 's disease demonstrated multiple , hypointense nodules on t2-weighted images , as well as contour abnormalities of the liver suggestive of cirrhosis .
for each mr imaging finding , mean age at mr examination was greater in patients with a positive finding than those with negative findings , and were statistically significant except in hyperintense nodules on t1-weighted images ( p = 0.113 ) ( table 3 ) . in the patients belonging to child - pugh class a ( n = 36 ) , mr findings such as intrahepatic nodules ( p = 0.007 ) , surface nodularity ( p = 0.011 ) , and gallbladder fossa widening ( p < 0.001 ) demonstrated a statistically significant difference between patients with neurological presentation and non - neurological presentation .
differences in age and duration of treatment were compared for both groups of clinical presentation , three groups of hepatic dysfunction , and type of mr finding using non - parametric probability tests ( mann - whitney or kruskal - wallis ) .
the k - f ring was most common in the neurological presentation ( 92% , 11 of 12 ) relative to non - neurological presentation ( 45% ; 17 of 38 ; p = 0.006 ) .
