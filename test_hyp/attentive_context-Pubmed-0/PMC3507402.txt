no correlation was found between obstructive symptoms and boo as defined on uroflowmetry , in a specific population of sui women .
75% ( 27/36 ) of the women in the non - vds group had normal uroflowmetry , and 25% ( 9/36 ) an abnormal one without symptoms .
sui population without severe pelvic organ prolapse ( baden and walker staging system 1 ) , previous sui surgery , or neurological disorders ( the most frequent etiologies of voiding dysfunction in women ) we found a 29% ( 29/93 ) rate of abnormal uroflowmetry . characteristics of women with and without voiding difficulties symptoms in terms of age , menopausal status , parity , anorectal disorders and uroflowmetry parameters sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive value of voiding dysfunction symptoms on bfluts multivariate analysis ( using multiple logistic regression method ) demonstrated no correlation between symptoms and quantitative uroflowmetry parameters ( maximum and average flow rate , acceleration , urine volume , time to maximum flow and voiding time ) , and no correlation was found between vds and age , menopausal status , parity or concomitant anorectal disorders [ table 4 ] . logistic regression method for multivariate analysis of urodynamic parameters ( maximal and average flow rate , time to void and acceleration ) , age , menopausal status , parity , concomitant anorectal disorders with respect to voiding difficulties symptoms univariate analysis of multiple factors with respect to voiding difficulties symptoms
