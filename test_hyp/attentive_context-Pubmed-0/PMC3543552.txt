the objective of this study was to demonstrate equivalence between cefpodoxime ( test drug ) and ciprofloxacin ( comparator ) with respect to their effectiveness in aecsom .
changes in otological symptom score in the cefpodoxime group ( group a).p < 0.05- days 3 , 7 , 14 vs day 0 changes in otological symptom score in the ciprofloxacin group ( group b ) .
the present study was planned to compare the effectiveness and safety of cefpodoxime with ciprofloxacin in aecsom .
the results of this study demonstrated that a 7-day course of cefpodoxime is comparable to ciprofloxacin in terms of both clinical effectiveness and safety for the treatment of aecsom in an outpatient setting .
although cost of drug therapy was higher with cefpodoxime compared with ciprofloxacin , it should not be considered as a drawback .
p < 0.05- days 3 , 7 , 14 vs day 0 intergroup comparison of otological symptom score intragroup analysis of otological symptom score at baseline ( day 0 ) against day 3 , day 7 and day 14 scores showed a highly significant decrease in both groups [ figures 2 and 3 ] , and there was a clinically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of the aecsom .
