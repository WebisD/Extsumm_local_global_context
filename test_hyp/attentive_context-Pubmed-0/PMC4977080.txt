this study was designed to evaluate monocular as well as binocular visual acuity at distance , intermediate , and near under photopic and mesopic lighting conditions in patients bilaterally implanted with this aspheric diffractive multifocal one - piece iol .
high levels of spectacle independence with low levels of photic phenomenon were achieved , resulting in excellent patient satisfaction .
bilateral implantation of tecnis multifocal one - piece iols provided good distance , intermediate , and near visual acuity under photopic as well as mesopic lighting conditions .
sixteen patients ( 13 females and three males ) with a mean age of 66.29.2 years ( range : 5081 years ) who had previously undergone bilateral phacoemulsification surgery with implantation of the tecnis multifocal one - piece iol ( zmb00 ; abbott medical optics , inc . , santa ana , ca , usa ) at empire eye and laser center , bakersfield , ca , usa , between june 2010 and june 2011 were examined prospectively for visual acuity assessment under different lighting conditions and were asked to report satisfaction based on a subjective questionnaire .
multifocal intraocular lenses ( iols)1 provide spectacle independence by producing two or more focal points for distance , intermediate , and near vision.24 however , multifocality can result in reduced image contrast and unwanted photic phenomenon in the form of halos and glare.1,3 diffractive multifocal iols provide better uncorrected near visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and reading performance with less photic phenomenon than refractive multifocal iols,5,6 but they have still been associated with some reduction in visual quality.7 material and design developments have contributed to improved optics . for example , the correction of spherical aberration8,9 with aspheric diffractive multifocal iols has been shown to improve visual quality and outcomes.2,10,11 additionally , materials with low chromatic dispersion and a high abbe number can reduce chromatic aberration and improve contrast sensitivity.12 the tecnis multifocal iol is an aspheric diffractive multifocal iol that comes in either silicone ( three - piece [ zm900 ] ) or a low - dispersion high abbe number ( 55 ) hydrophobic acrylic ( one - piece [ zmb00 ] and three - piece [ zma00]).12 a full diffractive surface with steps of uniform height is present over the posterior surface of the optic , providing a + 4.0 d near and with equal distribution of light to distance and near regardless of pupil size,13 helping to provide good functional vision under varied lighting conditions.14 the tecnis multifocal iol has been demonstrated to yield high levels of spectacle independence , low residual refractive error , and good distance and near visual acuity , resulting in high levels of patient satisfaction.2,4,15 however , none of the published papers report visual acuity at intermediate with this lens .
