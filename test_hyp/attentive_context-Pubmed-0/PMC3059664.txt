in addition , attention related neuromodulatory signals , through the regulation of activity patterns and/or the adaptation of the plasticity rule itself ( i.e. , metaplasticity , abraham , 2008 ) might optimize the induction and expression of stdp in the intact brain .
modification of the efficacy of synaptic transmission , or synaptic plasticity , is widely considered as the basis of activity - dependent neuronal development and learning ( feldman and brecht , 2005 ) .
endogenous patterns of ongoing in vivo activity like oscillatory rhythms , burstiness and sparse neural activity might help to counteract the effect of spurious spike coincidences and reduce the vulnerability of plasticity in vivo .
the algorithms of synaptic plasticity introduced by sejnowski ( 1977a , b ) to model plasticity in the cerebellum , and later by bienenstock et al . ( 1982 ) for the primary visual cortex , overcome the problem of the synaptic saturation without introducing an ad hoc normalization rule . they are based on an input / output covariance algorithm where the change in synaptic efficacy is proportional to the covariation of pre- and postsynaptic activities .
thus , most algorithms used to model synaptic plasticity in the developing or adult cortex include synaptic potentiation and depression rules . they can be mathematically described by a general equation where the modification of synaptic weight as a function of time is proportional to the product of a presynaptic and a postsynaptic term ( review in frgnac and shulz , 1994 , 1999 ) . in these plasticity algorithms a precise temporal order between pre- and postsynaptic activation onsets is not required .
