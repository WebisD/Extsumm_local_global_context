the key findings of the present study were that , compared to healthy controls , patients suffering from idiopathic cscr experienced higher anxiety , that anxiety in patients with cscr was higher irrespective of whether cscr was experienced for the first or for the second time , and that anxiety scores did not differ between males and females .
no statistically significant correlations were observed between the anxiety scores and the loss of acuity and duration of the current cscr , the area of detachment , and the permeability and dilatation of choroid ( ie , choroidal homeostasis ; all rs<0.11 ps>0.60 ) .
anxiety scores were not lower if cscr was experienced for a second time , suggesting therefore that no psychophysiological adaptation occurs with repetition of cscr .
no statistically significant correlations were observed between the anxiety scores and the loss of acuity and duration of the current cscr , the area of detachment , and the permeability and dilatation of choroid ( ie , choroidal homeostasis ; all rs<0.11 ps>0.60 ) .
accordingly , a further aim of the present study was to explore to what extent anxiety scores differ between male and female patients with cscr .
