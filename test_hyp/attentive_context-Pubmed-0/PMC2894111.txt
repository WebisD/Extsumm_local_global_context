n nanotubes directly onto commercial stainless steel foil is demonstrated by using raw materials of boron powder , zinc oxide powder , and ethanol absolute .
the nanotubes are pure with bamboo - like morphology and an average diameter of about 90 nm . during the formation process
, the stainless steel foil plays a catalyst role additionally besides the substrate role for the b 
the growth mechanism of the nanotubes is also investigated in this study . to the best of our knowledge , it is the first time to report the synthesis of ternary b 
the obtained nanotubes have an average diameter of about 90 nm and the b , c , and n elements are found to be homogeneously distributed in the nanotubes .
the growth of nanotubes was carried out in a conventional tube furnace . an alumina boat loaded with about 1.0 g mixture of hexagonal zno and amorphous b powder ( with a zno : b molar ratio of 1.5:1 )
