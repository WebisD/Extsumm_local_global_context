. therefore , the aim of this study was to relate the condition of oral health to the level of oral intake and the degree of swallowing dysfunction in elderly patients with stroke in chronic phase .
the number of teeth were demonstrated to be related to the level of dysphagia in individuals with right hemiplegia , which shows that the oral health condition differentially affects the physiological responses of swallowing , influenced by the brain damage .
the loss of teeth , very common in this population , is related to the reduction of bone tissue , receptors ( proprioceptors and periodontal ligaments ) , and muscle atrophy .
the findings of this study indicate that the oral health condition of elderly individuals after stroke in chronic phase showed an association with the level of oral intake and the degree of oropharyngeal dysphagia . the limitations of the study should be considered , one being the lack of access to the imaging examinations to characterize the individuals according to the type of stroke , damaged areas , and extent of injury , and heterogeneity of the time of brain involvement , in addition to the effects of medications and other comorbidities , which were not taken into account .
