the preoperative spherical equivalent ( se ) and bcva were obtained and compared , no statistically significant difference was noticed in the mean preoperative se ( 10.39  8.43 d in artisan group and  10.39  2.29 d in artiflex group ; p = 0.999 ) and bcva of two groups ( 0.25  0.21 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [ logmar ] for artisan group and 0.19  0.18 logmar for artiflex group ; p = 0.56 ) .
contrast sensitivity data after phakic intra - ocular lens implantation subjective comparison of day and night vision in artisan versus artiflex treated eyes the mean of sia was 1.65  0.82 d in artisan group , and 1.31  1.05 in artiflex group , which showed no statistically significant difference between the groups ( p = 0.19 ) . in a subjective evaluation of day vision
in this study , 25% of patients with artisan lens lost two or more lines of bcva , we called the patients back and examined them again carefully , we recognized that in one patient both eyes had refractive error postoperatively in spite of implanting a lens with the same power of his preoperative se improvement in bcva was not seen with correction of this refractive error by trial - frame . in the other patients , we could not find any reason for the decrease in the bcva , unless considering pigment deposition on the iol as a reason for the visual loss .
