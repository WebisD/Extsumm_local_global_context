the terminal implants were placed in the second premolar , three - dimensional ( 3d ) finite element analysis was used to explore the effects of different tilt angles ( 0 , 30 and 45 ) and different lengths ( s for standard length and l for long length ) of the terminal implants on the stress distributions of implants , bone , and superstructure when a full arch fixed prosthesis was used to restore the complete set of 14 teeth in edentulous mandibles .
with four - implant - supported fixed restorations for edentulous mandibles , configurations with the terminal implants tilted distally and extended in varying degrees resulted in various reductions in the stresses on implants and surrounding bone .
matching of the tilt angle and the length of terminal implants might maximize the reduction . under the present experimental conditions , the tilt45-l group was the preferred configuration . by optimizing the design
compared with the tilt0-s , the maximum stress levels of the # 1 implant in the tilt45-s and the tilt45-l were reduced by 7.6% and 32.6% , respectively ; those of the # 2 implants were reduced by 18.5% and 28.8% , respectively ; those of the # 3 implants showed the greatest reduction of 26.4% and 33% , respectively ; those of the # 4 implant , in the tilt45-s increased by 2.8% , in the tilt45-l reduced by 27.9% .
