, we report the first case , to our knowledge , of sarcoid - like lung granulomas in a hemodialysis patient treated with vildagliptin .
in conclusion , the administration of dpp-4 inhibitors in patients undergoing hemodialysis is possibly linked with the new onset of sarcoid - like granulomatosis .
a 70-year - old female began to receive hemodialysis for end - stage renal disease due to diabetic nephropathy in august 2010 .
we herein reported a case of sarcoid - like lung granulomas in a patient under hemodialysis who was treated with vildagliptin . to the best of our knowledge ,
this is the first case of granulomatosis related to the use of a dpp-4 inhibitor . in general , the incidence of adverse effects of dpp-4 inhibitors is lower than that of other oral hypoglycemic agents , and this case represents a very rare adverse effect of vildagliptin .
the accumulation of vildagliptin and its metabolites may affect the immune system and provoke unexpected side effects in dialysis patients with t2 dm . therefore , the use of non - renal excreted dpp-4 inhibitors , such as linagliptin , may reduce the risk of pharmacokinetic complications . since we ethically can not readminister the drug in this case , other possible causes of granulomas remain , for example , a late response to therapy for tb or the spontaneous regression of sarcoidosis .
