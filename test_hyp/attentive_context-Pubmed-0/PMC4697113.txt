laser - assisted microscopic discectomy or endoscopic discectomy has been used in a narrow surgical field in the lumbar spine.6 in this study , we report 12 cases of unilateral cervical radiculopathy that were managed by a posterior approach with a co2 laser for disc removal or foraminal decompression and discuss the clinical and radiological outcomes and efficacy of the co2 laser .
we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 12 consecutive patients with unilateral cervical radiculopathy who underwent posterior foraminal decompression or discectomy by use of a co2 laser between january 2006 and december 2008 .
the patients included eight men and four women with a mean age of 53.0 years ( range , 41 - 75 years ) and a mean follow - up duration of 33.3 months ( range , 19 - 44 months ) .
the inclusion criteria for this study were as follows : unilateral cervical foraminal stenosis and unilateral posterolateral soft disc herniation as demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , unilateral radicular symptoms and/or neck pain consistent with radiologic findings , and unsuccessful outcome of conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks .
postoperative vas scores for radicular symptoms improved or resolved in all patients compared with preoperative states ( table 1 ) . for odom 's criteria , excellent ( 33.3% ) or good ( 50% ) results were obtained at discharge , and patients returned to their preoperative employment and physical activity . at the last follow - up , 11 patients ( 91.7% ) showed excellent or good clinical outcomes with respect to odom 's criteria , and 1 patient ( 8.3% ) was fair at the last follow - up ( fig .
