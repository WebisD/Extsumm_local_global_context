we report a case of a pscc with advanced lymph node metastasis treated with combination therapy consisting of taxane - based chemotherapy , irradiation , and mohs paste .
penile squamous cell carcinoma ( pscc ) , the predominant histological type ( > 95% ) of penile cancer , is a relatively rare malignant tumor in western countries and japan .
combination treatment with taxane - based chemotherapy , external beam radiation therapy , and mohs paste is a reliable option for the induction therapy for recurrent pscc .
several studies have shown the efficacy of mohs paste for maintaining malignant wounds in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the breast , skin , head , and neck   .
an 80-year - old male presented to a community hospital with pain and redness in his left inguinal region .
mohs chemosurgery is a technique of chemical fixation of a cutaneous tumor and subsequent excision .
in our patient with inguinal recurrence of pscc , multimodal treatment , consisting of combination chemotherapy , irradiation , and mohs chemosurgery , was responsible for the tumor shrinkage and the successful local control of a malignant wound .
therefore , the patient may have been able to avoid cancer progression for a much longer time if he had received additional maintenance chemotherapy . in conclusion , we report a case of successful local control of a recurrent inguinal mass of pscc treated with multimodal therapy . to the best of our knowledge ,
