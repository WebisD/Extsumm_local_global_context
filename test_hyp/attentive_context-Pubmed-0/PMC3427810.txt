although we allowed endoscopic vein harvesting to continue after confirmation of the co2 embolism with direct inspection of the saphenous - femoral vein junction and meticulous closure of the tears were confirmed , further investigation into the safety of this practice is warranted .
a 55-year - old caucasian female was undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery following a recent myocardial infarction .
in summary , the use of endoscopic vein harvesting for the saphenous vein has become increasingly more common and awareness and prevention of the potential for a co2 embolism is important . as seen in our case , tee played a vital role in detection , and we believe that the mid - esophageal bicaval view should be used as the standard view during endoscopic vein harvesting .
our case not only confirms the vital role of tee in the quick and accurate diagnosis of a co2 embolism during endoscopic vein harvesting but also allowed us to focus on the mid - esophageal bicaval view , a view not commonly used to identify a co2 embolism .
as the cardiac surgeon harvested the left internal mammary artery , the first assistant harvested the saphenous vein from the left leg via an endoscopic approach ( stryker endoscopy , san jose , ca , usa ) using co2 insufflation at 4 l / min and a pressure of 14 mmhg .
