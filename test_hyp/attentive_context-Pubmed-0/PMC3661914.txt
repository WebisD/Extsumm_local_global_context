tuning materials into a quasi - critical fluctuation regime offers the opportunity to make use 
 of exotic properties associated with such a fluctuating state . among these properties
a metal  adsorbate system is analysed , in which charge - density 
 fluctuations cause an unconventional phase transition .
are a strong 
 response to external perturbations and novel types of interactions , such as the casimir force or 
 cooper pairing .
the phase transition is modelled in the 
 spirit of landau theory by expanding the free energy in terms of a cdw order parameter , but also 
 adding terms representing the inter - adsorbate repulsion and the adsorbate  substrate coupling . 
 transferring the same model to the controversially discussed surface structures observed on 122 
 fe - based superconductors a consistent explanation of both
, the temperature dependence and the 
 relative stability of the structures as a function of chemical composition is reached . as a 
 consequence , it is suggested that cdw ( or eventually orbital order ) fluctuations are present in 
 these compounds with a wave vector differing by an angular offset of 45 from that of the afm 
the parameter range in which fluctuations persist is considerably enhanced in 
 low - dimensional systems .
