given the current controversy regarding best surgical practice for the treatment of achalasia , the objective of our study was to compare the reflux - related and regurgitation - related quality - of - life outcomes between patients undergoing myotomy with toupet fundoplication and those undergoing myotomy with dor fundoplication .
the median follow - up time was 60 ( 3684 ) months for the toupet group and 19 ( 1422 ) months for the dor group ( p < .001 ) .
the study group consisted of 135 consecutive patients who underwent lhc with fundoplication between 1998 and 2010 by 1 surgeon at a single institution . before january 2010
there was no difference between dor and toupet fundoplication with respect to the incidence of postoperative gerd symptoms ( p = .49 ) .
in addition , we investigated overall patient satisfaction after lhc in the treatment of achalasia .
patients undergoing dor or toupet fundoplication experienced no significant difference in dysphagia or gerd incidence or severity in the short term .
median operative time was shorter in the dor group than the toupet group ( 100   vs 129.5   min , p < .01 ) ( table 1 ) .
