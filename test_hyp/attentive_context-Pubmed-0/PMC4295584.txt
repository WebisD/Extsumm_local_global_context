the aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long - term outcomes of laparoscopic watson fundoplication in children and infants in terms of durability and the incidence of mechanical complications , especially in those children with neurological impairment .
this study confirms that the technique of laparoscopic watson fundoplication is safe in infants and children , including those with significant neurological disability .
this was a prospective observational study of 76 children and infants who had laparoscopic watson fundoplication performed by a single surgeon at the royal aberdeen children 's hospital and the royal alexandra children 's hospital in brighton between 1995 and 2014 .
adverse events , although relatively common , were generally very mild and tended to be transient .
contrast studies in these patients confirmed failure of the wrap and recurrence of hiatus hernia .
one child developed late dysphagia and was found to have a recurrent stricture proximal to the wrap on barium swallow , requiring endoscopic balloon dilatation .
the majority of children ( n = 68 ; 89.4% ) also underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 44 ( 57.9% ) patients had ph studies .
of the 76 patients undergoing surgery , 21 ( 27.6% ) had a gastrostomy placed at the same time .
