2008 ) . in this study , using a candidate gene approach , we determined the methylation status of the promoter - associated cpg island of itih5 in leukemia cell lines and primary aml patient samples .
therefore , the analysis of a larger number of well - characterized patient samples may be useful to further clarify the possible role of aberrant itih5 methylation as a biomarker in aml .
5survival curves of patients with primary aml according to the itih5 methylation status at diagnosis ( p  =  0.08 ) . in a total of 104 patients analyzed
lane u amplified product with primers recognizing the unmethylated itih5 sequence , lane m amplified product recognizing the methylated itih5 sequence among clinical prognostic parameters , we found no significant correlation between hypermethylation of itih5 and cytogenetics ( table  3 ) , elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase , french  american  british subtype , gender , age , peripheral blood cell counts , and overall survival ( os ; p  =  0.08 ; fig . 
aberrant dna hypermethylation associated with transcriptional silencing of the putative tumor suppressor gene itih5 has previously been found in breast cancer and reportedly has a negative prognostic impact in this disease ( himmelfarb et al .
