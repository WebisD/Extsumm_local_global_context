the patient was treated with shoulder arm sling for 6 weeks followed by physiotherapy . at 6 months
we present an unusually rare case of a simultaneous fracture of the coracoid process and the lateral end of clavicle .
follow up the patient was pain free with full range of motion at right shoulder .
concomitant fractures of lateral end clavicle and coracoid process are rare and may not be visible of plain radiographs .
a coracoid fracture is a rare orthopaedic condition as it accounts for only 2  10 % of all scapular fractures and < 0.1% of all fractures . in even rarer cases coracoid fractures
ct scan may be indicated if the clinical examination suspects additional injuries of shoulder girdle .
in view of the sparse and controversial literature available , we believe that the patient should be appropriately informed of both operative and nonoperative options treatment options . in our case the patient preferred nonoperative management which resulted in an excellent clinical result .
concomitant fractures of lateral end clavicle and coracoid process are rare and may not be visible of plain radiographs .
coracoid fractures alone are themselves a rare occurrence amounting to approximately < 0.1% of all fractures and even only 5% of all fractures of the shoulder [ 1 - 3 ] .
