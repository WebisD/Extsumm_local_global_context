the present 
 results suggest that serum - free starvation - induced atrophy may be in part mediated by 
 cofilin from l6 myoblasts .
in summary , 
 the phosphorylation of cofilin was decreased in starved skeletal muscle cells .
therefore , we investigated the changes in the phosphorylation of 
 cofilin in l6 myoblasts during serum - free starvation with low glucose
morphologic ( a - a30 , 
 a - b100 ) and immunoblotting ( b ) analyses in the starved l6 myoblasts .
p , phosphorylated protein . the basal levels of 
 abundance and phosphorylation in controls ( 0 hour ) were considered to be 100% . 
 * compared with the 0 hour control , p<0.05 .
however , the expression of cofilin was significantly increased after 3 , 6 , 
 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours of starvation compared with the expression of cofilin in the 
 control groups ( n=34 , fig .
