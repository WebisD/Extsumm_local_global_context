thus we report here a case of acd , a rare disease , with unusual symptoms , that was successfully treated with surgery .
a 59-year - old man presented with a swelling of the left lower extremity that had begun two months earlier .
acd is an unusual cystic tumor of the blood vessels characterized by the accumulation of a mucinous substance in the adventitia .
microscopically , the presence of a mucinous cyst and vessel wall degeneration confirmed cystic adventitial disease of the common femoral artery ( fig .
we suspected adventitial cystic disease ( acd ) of the common femoral vein , and the patient underwent an operation . under general anesthesia in a supine position , the femoral artery and vein were dissected for about 5 cm with a longitudinal incision on the left inguinal area .
the mri images showed a cystic mass compressing the left common femoral vein as well ( fig .
angioplasty was performed to repair the femoral artery whose wall was partially resected . because the patient had had a partial circulation problem in the vein before the surgery and thus venous obstruction was possible , a polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) patch was used for angioplasty instead of using an autologous vein graft . a cystic mass excision with ptfe roofing angioplasty
