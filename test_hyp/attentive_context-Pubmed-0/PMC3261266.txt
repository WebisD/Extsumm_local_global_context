we conducted a case  control study to investigate the potential association between maternal exposure to terbutaline and other b2ar agonists during pregnancy and risk of delivering an infant subsequently diagnosed with an asd .
0 case mothers and 1 ( 4.5% ) control mothers had a diagnosis of asthma only , 28 ( 84.5% ) of case mothers and 18 ( 81.8% ) of control mothers had a diagnosis of preterm labor only , and 3 ( 9.1% ) case mothers and no control mothers had both asthma and preterm labor diagnoses . in order to explore the effect of terbutaline exposure on autism risk independent of the effect of the indicating condition
prenatal exposure to any b2ar occurred at a similar rate among children with autism and control children .
there is a suggestion that maternal exposure to terbutaline for greater than 2  days during the third trimester of pregnancy could be associated with elevated autism risk  however ,
