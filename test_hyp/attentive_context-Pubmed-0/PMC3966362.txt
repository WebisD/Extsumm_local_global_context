ferret hev  like particles derived from 1 of the isolates from the netherlands were cross - reactive with serum from hev - infected laboratory ferrets in the united states ( 11 ) . in conclusion , we isolated and identified 2 ferret hev strains from laboratory ferrets imported from the united states .
we amplified the entire genome of 2 ferret hev strains isolated from laboratory ferrets imported from the united states .
nucleotide sequence comparisons showed that 2 ferret hev strains from the united states had high ( 99.6% ) identity and shared 98.6%100% identities with partial sequences of orf1 that were detected in the united states ( 11 ) , which indicated that genetically similar ferret hev was circulating in laboratory ferrets .
although nucleotide sequence identities of the entire genome for strains from the united states and the netherlands was 82.4%82.5% , orf2 showed relatively high amino acid identities ( 94.2%94.8% ) , which suggested that isolated from the united states and the netherlands share similar antigenicity .
phylogenetic relationships among genotypes 14 and wild boar , rabbit , rat , avian , bat , and ferret isolates of hepatitis e virus .
although we can not conclude whether ferret hev from the united states is a new genotype , these results indicated that there is genetic variety in ferret hev .
