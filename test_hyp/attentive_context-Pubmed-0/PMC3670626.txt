the present study reports a rare case of primary tracheal malignancy treated with surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy .
the prognosis of patients with malignant tumors of the trachea remains gloomy , and long - term median survival of tracheal adenocarcinoma patients undergoing combined modalities is unknown to us .
primary adenocarcinoma of the trachea needs to be diagnosed at an early stage , and combined multimodal approaches may be explored to attain an extended median survival .
primary tumors of the trachea are rare and account for 0.1% of all malignancies . in adults ,
our 60-year - old diabetic and hypertensive male patient had a 1-month history of cough associated with marked respiratory distress and occasional dyspnea in the right lateral lying position .
squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) and adenoid cystic carcinoma ( acc ) make up about 71.6% of all adult primary tracheal tumors . the remaining portion ( 28.4% )
preoperative radiation therapy has been attempted in some patients , yet the most compelling evidence for adjuvant radiation therapy comes from postoperative cases .
complete response was documented , and the patient is still alive without any evidence of disease during 30 months of follow - up .
