tas levels of cbz treated group were significantly lower compared to those of the control group ( p < 0.0001 ) .
therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative and antioxidative status in cbz - treated epileptic children to improve the data regarding the connection between cbz treatment and oxidative stress .
conversely , tos and osi levels were found to be significantly higher in cbz treated group ( p < 0.004 and p < 0.0001 , respectively ) ( table 1 ) . in cbz
the study is composed of 40 epileptic children ( 22 males , 18 females ) and 31 healthy children ( 17 males , 14 females ) , with an age range between 4 and 12 years .
abbreviations : cbz , carbamazepine ; osi , oxidative stress index ; tas , total antioxidant status ; tos , total oxidant status . cbz : carbamazepine ; tos : total oxidant status .
, antioxidant mechanism could not be playing any role in antiepileptic effect of cbz . furthermore , increased oxidative stress induced by cbz could be the cause of carbamazepine - induced seizures , a complication of cbz treatment .
