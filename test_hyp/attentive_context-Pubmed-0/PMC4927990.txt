diabetic nephropathy ( dn ) represents an important cause of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) that frequently leads to end stage renal disease ( esrd ) .
an update of the urinary biomarkers used in early dn is useful for establishing their role in the early diagnosis of this disease , with subsequent prophylactic and therapeutic implications .
the concomitant assessment of several urinary biomarkers in relationship with microalbuminuria could represent at present a method of diagnosing early dn .
the great progress in discovering new biomarkers could lead to the development of an  ideal  urinary biomarker to detect early diabetic dn in the future .
progresses in the field of urinary biomarkers in dn , promising both in proteomics and in other modern techniques , develop remarkably at present .
another classification belongs to hong and chia who present 3 categories of biomarkers : glomerular , tubular , other proteins .it should be noted that products of metabolism in dm are also eliminated in the urine , and they can trigger toxic effects , for example , advanced glycation end products ( age ) . since we will frequently refer to microalbuminuria in presenting other biomarkers used in studying lesions of the nephron , namely , of the glomerulus and of the tubules , we will first present the main observations regarding microalbuminuria in diagnosing dn .
