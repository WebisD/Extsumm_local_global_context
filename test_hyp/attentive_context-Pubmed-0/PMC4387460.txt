the injection of a large amount of fluid during neuroplasty in a patient with spinal stenosis may cause compressive nerve damage .
, we presented a rare case of unilateral motor weakness following epidural neuroplasty , on the side opposite to the lesions .
a 19-year - old patient was admitted for low back pain and radiating pain in the posterior aspect of the left leg which had begun 2 months prior .
the patient in the present study presented severe spinal stenosis , with a herniated disc occupying more than 2/3 of the spinal canal .
. acute monoplegia following epidural adhesiolysis has previously been reported in a patient with failed - back syndrome and foraminal stenosis of the l4-l5 levels . however , to the best of our knowledge , there has been no report of acute motor weakness in the opposite lower extremity after percutaneous epidural neuroplasty .
they presented acute right monoplegia which had occurred after epidural adhesiolysis of the bilateral l5 nerve root in a patient with failed - back surgery syndrome , with spontaneous recovery after 5 weeks .
were found , and swelling of the right l5 nerve root was also discovered . after the surgery
