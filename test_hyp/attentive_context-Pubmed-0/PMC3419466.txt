in this paper , we have performed excited 
 state accelerated ab initio molecular dynamics ( a - aimd ) 
 to explore the excited 
 state energy landscape and photophysical properties of a variety of 
 systems . in an initial case study on formaldamine , we have found that 
 a - aimd can be readily employed to enhance configurational space sampling 
 for the study of molecular systems in the excited state , crossing 
 energy barriers on the excited state energy landscape of up to 30 
 kcal / mol and affording a quantitative description of the excited state 
 free energy surface .
we demonstrate 
 how a - aimd can be used to describe the thermally averaged solvent 
 effect on the fluorescence spectra of molecular systems , most notably 
 making use of the enhanced configurational space sampling obtained 
 by a - aimd to accurately describe both the prominent features and line - shapes 
 of absorption and emission spectra .
we then demonstrate how the excited state a - aimd method can be used 
 to efficiently map out the photophysical topology of the system of 
 interest ( i.e. , characterizing the variation in the vertical de - excitation 
 energy gap as a function of the relevant internal degrees of freedom 
 of the system ) .
