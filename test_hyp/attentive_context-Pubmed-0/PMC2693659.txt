this was carried out by the simultaneous analysis of the duplex - nested pcr for a r320x mutation in the otc gene underlying the otc deficiency and y chromosome - specific loci , and fish for aneuploidy screening of chromosome x , y and 18 .
we have applied a duplex - nested pcr for the amplification of both the causative mutation and the y chromosome specific sry gene , and fish for aneuploidy screening of chromosome x , y and 18 .
, we describe the successful pregnancy and birth after pgd for otc deficiency with simultaneous analyses of fish and duplex - nested pcr in korea .
this strategy could provide higher accuracy for the selection of genetically and chromosomally normal embryos in pgd for single gene defects .
mutations have been found in all exons and introns with a relative paucity of mutations in the sequence encoding the leader peptide ( exon 1 and a part of exon 2 ) and in exon 7 ( 17 , 18 ) . to our knowledge , only two cases have been reported where specific pgd for otc deficiency were carried out using multiplex or duplex - nested pcr assay and healthy babies devoid of the otc mutation were born ( 19 , 20 ) . in this study
