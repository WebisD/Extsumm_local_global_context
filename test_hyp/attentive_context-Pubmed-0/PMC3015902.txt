laparoscopic retrograde ( fundus first ) cholecystectomy was carried out utilizing a laparoscopic liver retractor .
a case is detailed herein of a 67-year - old man who presented with abdominal pain , fever , and jaundice .
mirizzi syndrome is a rare complication of cholecystolithiasis characterized by jaundice due to compression of the common hepatic duct
in this particular case , it was not possible at ercp to get a guidewire and stent past the obstruction . a stent was left through the papilla , below the obstruction and this allowed primary duct closure during surgery .
the diagnosis of mirizzi syndrome was made at ercp , and a stent was placed through the papilla .
. the diagnosis may not be immediately apparent , and management is controversial with open surgery still recommended by some authors .
a dilated bile duct was found on ultrasound , but the gallbladder could not be seen .
acute mirizzi syndrome should be suspected when a patient presents with acute cholecystitis and jaundice with dilated intrahepatic ducts on ultrasound .
in addition , the fitness of the patient for surgery and the complexity of the pathology are important for planning the therapeutic approach . in my opinion , ms should ideally be treated by a combination of ercp and stenting with laparosocopic
