patients with cysteine stones have high recurrence or regrowth rates and relatively large stone burdens with an earlier age of onset .
we retrospectively reviewed the data for 14 patients diagnosed with cystine stones who visited our outpatient clinic between march 1994 and july 2012 .
therefore , we report here our single - center experience of 14 cases of cystine stones to contribute to the development of such principles .
a total of 4 complications were observed over 35 procedures : 2 cases of transfusion , 1 case of febrile urinary tract infection ( uti ) , and 1 case of gross hematuria .
successful management of cystinuria thus requires a strict and regular follow - up schedule , appropriate multimodal approaches , and high patient compliance , especially in relation to medications , to prevent recurrent stone formation .
patients with cystinuria are reported to present their first typical symptomatic stone between 2 and 40 years of age , with a median age of onset of 12 and 15 years in female and male patients , respectively .
additional research is needed to determine adequate treatment strategies for this condition , including surgical and medical therapies , to eventually prevent deterioration of renal function in affected patients .
