in addition , prolonged exposure of brain microenvironments to a 
 142 for durations in excess of 7  d will be relevant to testing the animal model for altered vasculature and microglial - vascular interactions   under conditions of chronic inflammation .
  the primary aim of this work was to compare microvessel number , length , and morphological properties between a 
 142 and control pbs intrahippocampal injection in a rat model of ad with the same variables in human ad and nd brain tissue .
the present work was specifically designed to compare vascular perturbations in the animal model with specific microvessel changes and irregularities evident between ad and nd brain tissue .
the overall purpose of the present study was to test and extend the utility of a peptide intrahippocampal injection as an animal model of ad .
the changes include an increased mean number and diminished mean length of microvessels and prominent expression of microvessel abnormalities in peptide - injected rat and in ad brain tissue compared with pbs - injected and nd brain .
combined with measurements on bbb dysfunction , the a 
 142 animal model has demonstrated efficacy in simulating prominent vasculature changes evident in diseased tissue .
