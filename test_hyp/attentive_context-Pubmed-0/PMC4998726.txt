, we present magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( f - fdg ) positron emission tomography ( pet)/ct findings in a patient with primary uterine peripheral t - cell lymphoma .
this case indicates uterine lymphoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of abnormal uterine fdg accumulation along with physiological endometrial uptake , postpartum uterus , adenomyosis , endometrial hyperplasia , leiomyoma , cervical cancer , endometrial cancer , choriocarcinoma , uterine sarcoma , and uterine metastasis . in conclusion , primary uterine non - hodgkin 's lymphoma should be taken into consideration when a uterine tumor shows large size , relative hypointensity on both t2-weighted images and enhanced t1-weighted images compared to the surrounding myometrium , and intense fdg uptake on pet / ct .
a 27-year - old female was admitted to our hospital because of intermittent fever with neutropenia for 7 months .
primary uterine non - hodgkin 's lymphomas are extremely rare accounting for < 1% of all extranodal non - hodgkin 's lymphomas .
mri showed an ill - defined mass involved both the uterine corpus and cervix , resulting in diffuse enlargement of the uterus .
the mean age of patients with primary uterine non - hodgkin 's lymphoma at presentation is 55 years and abnormal uterine bleeding is the most frequent complaint .
