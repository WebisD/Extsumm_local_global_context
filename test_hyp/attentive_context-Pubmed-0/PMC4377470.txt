indeed , an emerging body of evidence demonstrates that a fine balance in mirna levels seems to be a fundamental to maintaining homeostasis in the pulmonary vasculature and an imbalance with mirna level playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of ph by regulating a set of targeted genes .
evolving evidence indicates that dysregulation of micrornas ( mirna or mir ) contributes to ph pathogenesis   .
understanding of mirnas role and function in the pulmonary circulation will offer and contribute a great potential to the pathogenesis of ph or pah .
there is no cure of this disease and current therapies are limited to reverse the vascular remodeling .
this review will collate vascular remodeling during ph , mirna biogenesis , recent advances on mirna modulation in ph , therapeutic opportunity , and conclusion .
the mirna signature can be used as a diagnostic tool for the development of therapeutic strategy .
although ph ( or pah ) is well - studied encompassing both cardiac and vascular boundaries , the precise cellular and molecular mechanism of initiation and progression of ph are not completely understood and are still being explored .
they were used as an alternative therapeutic strategy which targets downstream components of the no signaling pathway by inhibiting pde-5 , the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cgmp to gmp . despite the advancement of modern surgery or ph - specific therapy ,
