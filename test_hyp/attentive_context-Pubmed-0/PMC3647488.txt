proper disinfection of the entire ventilator circuit as recommended by the equipment manufacturer is crucial in avoiding potentially lethal b. cereus infections .
b. cereus transmission from contaminated respiratory equipment has been reported in other geographic areas . in the netherlands , an outbreak of b. cereus infections in a pediatric intensive care unit caused by contaminated reusable ventilator air flow sensors
our investigation underscores the necessity of close monitoring of occurrences of bacillus spp . in tracheal aspirates since clustering of such cases
switching to disposable air flow sensors stopped colonization with b. cereus in that unit . in canada , an outbreak of b. cereus infections among patients in an adult icu was linked to colonized ventilator circuitry ( 8) . in the united kingdom , reusable ventilator circuits were also identified as the cause of a b. cereus outbreak among intubated nicu patients ( 9 ) .
since all of them received intravenous antimicrobial drugs effective against b. cereus , it is conceivable that the clinical course of those patients could have been different without such treatment .
all case - patients in our investigation were considered to be colonized with b. cereus without clinical implications .
