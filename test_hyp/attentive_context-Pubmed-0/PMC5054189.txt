a 20-year - old female patient presented to the emergency department because of dyspnea and chest discomfort .
therefore , the demand for subpectoral implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices ( cieds ) is increasing in young female patients concerned about their body image .

combined subpectoral icd implantation and augmentation mammoplasty via the axillary incision is feasible in young female patients with icd indications and small breasts .
we present herein a successful case of combined subpectoral icd implantation and augmentation mammoplasty via axillary incisions in a young female patient who was dissatisfied with her body image .
