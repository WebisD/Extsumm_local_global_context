we report a case of pd - related peritonitis caused by c. freundii , which was successfully treated with double antibiotic coverage .
recently , serratia , pseudomonas / providencia , indole - positive proteus / acinetobacter / morganella , citrobacter , enterobacter and hafnia group of organisms ( spice ) were described to cause peritoneal dialysis ( pd)-related peritonitis with a particularly high morbidity and mortality .
peritonitis caused by citrobacter is relatively uncommon and citrobacter freundii is the most common species involved .
a 76-year - old male with end stage renal disease due to type ii diabetes mellitus on pd for 6 months presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and bloody peritoneal dialysate for 1 day .
prompt institution of broad antimicrobial coverage in unstable patients and following the culture sensitivity pattern reduces mortality and catheter losses from peritonitis caused by c. freundii .
earlier literature reports a high incidence of mortality and morbidity from catheter losses from pd - related peritonitis caused by c. freundii .
peritonitis caused by the members of the family enterobacteriaceae is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in pd patients and accounts for up to 12% of all peritonitis episodes in some series .
