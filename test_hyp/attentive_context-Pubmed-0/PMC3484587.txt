the aim of this preliminary investigation was therefore to evaluate the serum evolution of pct during intensive cardiac care unit ( iccu ) staying in a group of patients with cardiogenic shock ( cs ) following st - elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) submitted to primary percutaneous intervention ( pci ) with no laboratory or clinical sign of infection .
we further confirmed that higher values of nt - probnp are associated with increased mortality in cs patients and that a more marked systemic inflammation ( as inferred by higher values of crp ) and higher severity score ( as indicated by apache ii ) were associated with an ominous prognosis .
as depicted in table 2 , higher values of glycemia , nt - probnp and crp were detectable in dead patients in respect to survivors .
a progressive reduction in pct values was observed in cs patients who survived , whereas a lack of changes in pct concentrations was documented in cs patients who died .
we recently   observed that the degree of myocardial ischemia ( clinically indicated by the whole spectrum of acs , from unstable angina to cardiogenic shock st - elevation following myocardial infarction ) and the related inflammatory - induced response are better reflected by crp ( which was positive in most acute cardiac care patients of all our subgroups ) than by pct which seems more sensible to a higher extent of inflammatory activation , being positive only in all cs patients . in these patients , the clinical interpretation of absolute pct values ( both in diagnostic and prognostic terms ) , represent a major challenge since they may be influenced by several factors , such as the degree of systemic inflammatory response , the coexistence of multiorgan dysfunction , the presence / absence of infections and finally by the time of measurements during hospital course ( i.e. the dynamics of pct levels ) .
