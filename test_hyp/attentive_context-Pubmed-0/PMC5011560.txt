the aim of this study was to examine the long - term interventions effects of rat 
 rehabilitation on functional activity levels after acl reconstruction .
according to the results , the walking ability , balance ability and the extensor strength of 
 the knee joint were improved by the rat treatment , and the average semg value of the vastus 
 medialis muscle significantly increased .
10mwt : 10-meter walk test ; tug : timed up - and - go ; frt : functional reach test ; rat : 
 robot - assisted therapy the average semg value of vm , frt , and the maximum and average extensor strengths of the 
 knee joint isokinetic movement increased significantly .
this study recruited 8 patients who underwent arthroscopic acl reconstruction in boai 
 hospitals in beijing , china , between september and december 2015 .
