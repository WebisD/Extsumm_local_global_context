while pulmonary contusion is commonly associated with blunt thoracic trauma , appearance of cavitary lesions variably described as traumatic pulmonary pesudocysts , ( tpp ) , traumatic pneumatoceles , traumatic lung cysts are rare , developing in less than 3% of patients with pulmonary parenchymal injuries .
a 26 year old unmarried male was referred to us with history of left sided chest pain for two days .
a typical history of blunt trauma to chest , rapid radiological changes of the cavity and exclusion of other cavitary pulmonary diseases by adequate laboratory work helps in diagnosing this rare condition .
it is generally a self limiting benign condition , diagnosed by excluding other conditions which may present with similar radiological manifestations .
thoracic injury can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations depending on the structures involved like chest wall , diaphragm , mediastinum , trachea , lungs parenchyma etc .
the non penetrating trauma to the lungs manifests as contusions , lacerations of pulmonary parenchyma , pneumatocele formation , hematomas , and fractures of trachea and bronchi .
in view of the patient 's history of ancedent recent trauma , negative past and present history for any infectious process , and negative microbiological reports , a diagnosis of post traumatic pulmonary pseudo cyst ( tpp ) was made .
