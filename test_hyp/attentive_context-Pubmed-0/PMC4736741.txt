the purpose of the present study was to compare structural properties from sdoct to psychophysical measures in a subset of patients enrolled in a larger multicenter natural history study of xlrs .
for example , two patients ( ages 53 and 40 ) in this group , using ocular carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ( cais ) to reduce the swelling in the retina , had resolution of foveal schisis . of note , cai use was not prohibited in this study ; not all patients respond to cais , and other patients in this study had cystic changes in the macula without resolution while using this medication .
5e ) but that total thickness of the retina had weak association with these measures ( figs .
new findings include measures of os length and the relationship between os length and macular function based on microperimetry , sdh , cip , and bcva .
data presented here are consistent with previous measures of schisis cavities and decreased photoreceptor sensitivity in patients with xlrs .
c ) . the tr thickness failed to show a negative correlation with age in our patients tested with xlrs , unlike previous reports showing that younger patients had large foveal schisis cavities and older patients had thinner retinas with minimal cavities .
