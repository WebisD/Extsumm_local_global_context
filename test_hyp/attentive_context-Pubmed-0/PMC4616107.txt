this study aimed to compare the 
 electrophysiological characteristics of normal muscles versus muscles with latent or active 
 myofascial trigger points , and to identify their neuromuscular physiological 
 characteristics , in order to provide a quantitative evaluation of mps and clinical 
 foundational data for its diagnosis .
this study aimed to measure mvic , endurance , mdf , and muscle fatigue index of normal 
 muscles versus muscles with latent or active myofascial trigger points , thereby identifying 
 the neuromuscular physiological characteristics of muscles with active myofascial trigger 
 points and providing clinical foundational data that are applicable for the quantitative 
 evaluation and diagnosis of mps .
in addition , increases in mdf reflect recruitment of type ii 
 fibers , and muscle fatigue index can be analyzed according to the relationship between type 
 ii fibers and mdf13 , 14 . in the present experiment ,
surface emg , which was used to evaluate the functionality of trigger points in this study , 
 is nonintrusive and convenient ; thus , it is widely used in studies on the functional 
 characteristics of muscle , by analyzing the electrical activity of muscle .
therefore , this study s results will be effective in complementing the physical therapy 
 diagnosis of mps  which , until now , has focused on physical examination only  by understanding 
 not only the usefulness of electrophysiological analysis in mps diagnosis , but also the 
 neuromuscular physiological characteristics of active trigger point muscles .
