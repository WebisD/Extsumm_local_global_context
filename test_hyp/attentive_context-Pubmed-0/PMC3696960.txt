therefore , the difference between peritoneal level of crp in women with endometriosis and healthy cases is hypothesized .
after laparoscopy the patients were allocated into two groups ; women with ( group i , n = 90 ) and without ( group ii , n = 89 ) endometriosis .
crp levels in serum and peritoneal from the patients with endometriosis ( case ) and nonendometriosis ( control ) the star ( * ) indicates significant difference from control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
compared to the control group , the crp level of the peritoneal fluid were higher in patients with endometriosis ( p<0.05 ) .
the results indicated that the serum and peritoneal levels of crp were significantly different between case and control groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
no significant difference in serum level of crp between patients with endometriosis and healthy controls was detected ; however there was significant difference in peritoneal level of crp between case and control groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
the data for crp levels in serum and peritoneal from the patients with endometriosis ( case ) and non - endometriosis ( control ) is demonstrated in figure 1 .
