convergent total syntheses 
 of ( )-pyrimidoblamic acid and 
 p-3a were detailed based on the early stage preparation of the chiral 
 highly functionalized c2 side chain and subsequent late stage , divergent 
 construction of the pyrimidine cores through use of a powerful inverse 
 electron demand amidine/1,2,3-triazine [ 4 + 2 ] cycloaddition reaction 
 conducted at 25 c .
these observations with 
 1,2,3-triazines extend the utility of the inverse electron demand 
 cycloaddition reactions of electron - deficient heterocyclic azadienes 
 that includes the complementary 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-triazines , 1,2,4,5-tetrazines , and 1,2-diazines in the synthesis of highly substituted 
 and functionalized heterocycles found in complex natural products .
in addition to permitting full control 
 of the natural product stereochemistry , the approach provides the 
 opportunity for the late stage divergent synthesis of modified analogs 
 bearing deep - seated changes in either the pyrimidine core ( c4 and 
 c5 ) or the highly functionalized c2 side chain .
such investigations 
 are in progress and will be reported in due course . the examination 
 of the key 1,2,3-triazine cycloaddition reaction with amidines defined 
 nonobvious 1,2,3-triazine substituent effects that maintain or enhance 
 the heterocyclic azadiene reactivity without altering the intrinsic 
 regioselectivity or mode of cycloaddition .
we envisioned that the pyrimidine core 
 of ( )-pyrimidoblamic acid would arise from an 
 inverse electron demand 
 diels  alder reaction between the highly functionalized amidine 4 and 1,2,3-triazine 5a ( scheme 2 ) .
