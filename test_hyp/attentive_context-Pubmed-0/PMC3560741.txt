the morphometric data on the common iliac arteries may serve as a useful reference to professionals working in the area of congenital aorto - iliac abnormalities and morphologists teaching human developmental anatomy .
the common iliac arteries grow linearly in length , and parabolically in both diameter and volume .
because of this , in the present study we aimed to determine : age - specific reference intervals for length , external diameter and volume of the 2 common iliac arteries at varying gestational age , and the normal growth curves for each morphometric feature .
the values of the common iliac artery length increased from 4.761.05 to 15.381.60 mm on the right , and from 4.921.33 to 14.911.25 mm on the left for the 4-month group and 9-month group of gestation , respectively . in 75 ( 60.5% )
the right common iliac artery constitutes a predominant vessel in relation to its length ( 60.5% ) , external diameter ( 63.7% ) and volume ( 67.7% ) .
specimens the individual values of the common iliac artery length were greater on the right side . with regard to fetal age , the lengths of the right ( figure 2a ) and left ( figure 2b ) common iliac arteries increased according to the linear functions : y=3.598 + 0.585age 1.522 ( r=0.83 ) and y=3.107 + 0.554age 1.444 ( r=0.83 ) , respectively .
