to study the influence of increased worldwide dengue activity on international travelers , 2,259 patients were studied retrospectively for dengue antibodies after returning from dengue - endemic countries .
in addition , this variability underscores the importance of tourists ' seeking information before traveling to dengue - endemic areas .
in this study population , 4.7% of all febrile patients returning from different areas of the tropics had dengue antibodies that indicated acute infection .
the highest prevalence of dengue antibodies ( 4.6% ) , indicating acute infection , was found in patients returning from asia ( n = 1,020 ) ( table 1 ) , including southeast asia ( 7.4% of 500 total travelers and 11% of 310 febrile travelers ) and the indian subcontinent ( 1.8% ) .
traveling in southeast asia was associated with a significantly higher risk compared to other disease - endemic areas in africa and latin america ( odds ratio 5.3 , 95% confidence interval 3.29.0 ) . comparing patients with and without acute dengue infection ,
the figure shows annual dengue prevalence among travelers to thailand and to the indian subcontinent , highlighting that infection rates fluctuate strongly between years and between quarters within years . in the last quarter of 1997 and 1998
