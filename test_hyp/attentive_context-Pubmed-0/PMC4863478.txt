hence , the present study was designed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of newer enzymatic approaches , papacarie and carie - care as cmcr agents .
comparison of both groups with respect to dentinal tubule destruction carie - care group showed more amount of bacterial emanents when compared with papacarie .
the following conclusions were drawn from the study : 
 the mean time taken for caries removal was found to be more for carie - care when compared to papacariemore amount of bacterial remnants was present after excavation with carie - careboth papacarie and carie - care were found to be conservative as no dentinal tubule destruction was evident . 
  the mean time taken for caries
removal was found to be more for carie - care when compared to papacarie more amount of bacterial remnants was present after excavation with carie - care both papacarie and carie - care were found to be conservative as no dentinal tubule destruction was evident . since this is an in vitro study , the clinical significance of these findings can only be determined with further studies assessing the clinical outcome of these chemo - mechanical methods in caries excavation . within the limitations of the present study
