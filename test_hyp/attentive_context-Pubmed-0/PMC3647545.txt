the purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effects and to involve mechanisms of ems on ages induced - oxidative stress and apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells .
, endomorphins can attenuate the huvec dysfunction of synthesising and secreting no , enos , inos , et-1 induced by ages and may inhibited p38 mapk signal pathway in nucleus stimulated by ages .
these results indicate that ems efficiently inhibited the decrease of enos expression and secretion stimulated by ages in huvec . in the control group ( figure 6(a ) ) , the secretion of et-1 was 0.76  0.03  ng / ml after incubated for 24  h and was 0.99  0.08  ng / ml in ages - bsa treated group , which was significantly higher than that in the control group ( p < 0.005 ) .
these results indicated that ems efficiently inhibited the et-1 mrna expression and et-1 secretion in huvec . in this study ,
these findings have partly revealed the molecular mechanism of endomorphins on protecting huvecs from injuries induced by ages and thereby may provide the pharmacologic basis for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes .
the results indicated that the rescue effect of ems on the ages - induced injury may be mediated , at least in part , by the p38 mapk pathway .
