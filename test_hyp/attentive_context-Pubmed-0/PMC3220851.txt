the combined effects of epa - dha and ala on the two composite end points are compatible with additive effects of either epa - dha or ala . assuming an additive model , an hr of 0.47  0.58 = 0.27 is expected for ventricular arrhythmia  related events and of 0.81  0.60 = 0.49 for the combination of ventricular arrhythmias and fatal mi .
the study had enough power to detect significant effects of combined supplementation of epa - dha and ala on the end - point ventricular arrhythmia  related events whether or not in combination with fatal mi .
the protective effect of the combined supplementation of the three n-3 fatty acids on this end point ( hr 0.16 ; 95% ci 0.040.69 ) contrasts with the absence of an effect of epa - dha in cardiac patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators ( who all had had a severe arrhythmic event before placement ) ( 2 ) .
the proportion of women was lowest in the placebo group and highest in the ala group , and 5 ( 1.9% ) of the 267 women used hormone replacement therapy .
the results of more trials on the effect of different n-3 fatty acids are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn on their role in the etiology of ventricular arrhythmias and fatal chd .
