descriptive investigation of a cluster of 5 sfts cases following exposure to an index patient who died from the disease was performed . a 77-year - old male farmer who died from sfts
five other cases in the cluster included a 32-year - old male intensive care unit ( icu ) physician ( case 1 ) , a 48-year - old male icu consultation physician ( case 2 ) , a 42-year - old younger son of the index patient ( case 3 ) , and a 45-year - old older son of the index patient ( case 4 ) , as well as a 43-year - old male mortuary beautician ( case 5 ) .
here , we reported the person - to - person transmission of sftsv with a cluster of 6 sfts patients that occurred in shandong province of eastern china .
additionally , the lessons of person - to - person transmission of sftsv we learned from this study highlighted the necessity of establishing standard precautions for avoiding direct contact and blood - based transmission .
. however , the methods we used for diagnosis of sfts patients were well validated , and the human - to - human transmission of sftsv we described in this study could not simply be classified as being nosocomial transmission ; specially , 3 of the 5 secondary cases that occurred in the household .
