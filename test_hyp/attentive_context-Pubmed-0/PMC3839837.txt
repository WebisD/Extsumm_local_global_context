amatoxins have their most serious effect on the liver and account for 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings.4 this process is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period followed by the gastrointestinal and hepatotoxic phases which progress to multiorgan failure and death .
mushroom poisoning is a major health risk in rural areas , and it is presumed that over 5,000 species of mushrooms are present worldwide.1 in more than 90% of cases of ingestion , the type of mushroom is unknown because of difficulties in the exact identification of mushroom species.2 most of the ingested mushrooms are either nontoxic or only gastrointestinal irritants , resulting in mild to moderate toxic effects.3 cyclopeptide toxins are responsible for the pathogenicity of mushrooms . among these toxins ,
a 63-year - old male patient was admitted to the emergency room with weakness , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea .
the major parameter in the treatment of mushroom poisoning is the time of admission to hospital after ingestion .
the accidental consumption of poisonous mushrooms picked from their natural source presents a significant health problem , and clinicians should attempt to raise public awareness .
it has been reported that the amatoxin - related symptoms of mushroom poisonings began at 624 hours after the initial ingestion , and the most common first - noticed symptoms were gastrointestinal disturbance.7 determination of the latency period of symptoms after ingestion is very important in the treatment of mushroom poisoning because late toxicities ( symptom onset more than 6 hours after ingestion ) due to liver and renal failure are life - threatening and even fatal .
