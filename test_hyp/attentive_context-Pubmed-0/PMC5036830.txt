dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitors show particular promise for treating elderly t2 dm patients because they have excellent tolerability profiles , low risk of hypoglycemia , and little effect on body weight.4,16,17 therefore , this study evaluated the cost - effectiveness of dpp-4 inhibitor monotherapy compared with sulfonylurea ( sfu ) monotherapy or metformin monotherapy for treating elderly t2 dm patients in the thai context .
for treating elderly t2 dm patients in thailand , dpp-4 inhibitor monotherapy is not a cost - effective treatment compared to metformin monotherapy . in addition
as vildagliptin and sitagliptin were dominated by saxagliptin , the results of one - way sensitivity analysis , therefore , were displayed on saxagliptin compared to sfu . the change in hba1c from the baseline of dpp-4 inhibitors , discount rate , risk of severe hypoglycemia , and cost of saxagliptin had some effect on the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( icer ) ( figure 1 ) . the greater the effect of dpp-4 inhibitors on the reduction of hba1c from baseline , the lower icer ( figure 1 ) .
saxagliptin yielded the lowest incremental cost per qaly , followed by vildagliptin and sitagliptin ( thb3,632,604/qaly or us$110,212.50/qaly , thb4,335,273/qaly or us$131,531.34/qaly , and thb4,530,556/qaly or us$137,456.19/qaly , respectively ) . with the current thai threshold of thb160,000/qaly ( us$4,854.37/qaly ) , dpp-4 inhibitors were not cost - effective compared to sfu for treating elderly t2 dm patients in the thai context ( table 4 ) .
