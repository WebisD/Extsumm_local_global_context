the objective of this study was to characterize the anthropometric and dietary profile of women with pcos and to compare it with that of healthy age - matched women .
we recommend clinical trials to be designed to assess the effects of different patterns of diet and changes in anthropometric indices on the signs and symptoms of pcos .
the mean fat intake ( % ) was significantly higher in the pcos group than the control group ( p = 0.019 ) .
pcos is considered to be not only a reproductive endocrinopathy , but also a metabolic disorder , and its morbidity may include hyperinsulinemia , insulin resistance , early onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , macrovascular disease and thrombosis , endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma , and obstructive sleep apnea . in the present study , the dietary patterns and anthropometric characteristics of a group of women with pcos and a group of age - matched healthy women were compared .
sfa and pufa were also consumed more in the pcos group ( p = 0.043 and 0.025 , respectively ) .
pcos signs and dietary pattern in the normal weight and overweight patients with pcos the mean intakes of calorie in the pcos and control group were 1508  581 and 1207  391 kcal , respectively [ table 3 ] .
