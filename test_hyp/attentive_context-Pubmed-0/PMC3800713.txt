, a specially designed operative rasp was used to expand the canal space and to continue the elnd procedure in a patient whose canal around the hiatal opening was narrow at our institution .
a 32-year old male patient visited our institution with the chief complaint of pain in the right hip and the lower back which started after he had experienced a minor traffic accident ten months prior to his visit .
meticulous care and caution by pain physicians are required while performing the procedure described in this case report .
because the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed a central herniated lumbar disc between l4 and l5 and compression of the right l5 nerve root , we decided to perform elnd .
the rasp used in this case report was designed as a cone with a helical surface .
a vertical incision was made at the sacral hiatus , and hyperplastic cartilaginous tissue was found after dissecting the tissue until the hiatus was exposed , and the procedure was continued after removing it with a kerrison rongeur . in the other case ,
for this reason , an anatomical variation at the sacral canal opening including stenosis may often make access of a device needed for the procedure impossible , thus causing the failure of the procedure , bringing about a loss in time , effort and cost for the patient and medical staff , and even decreasing the usefulness of the procedure .
