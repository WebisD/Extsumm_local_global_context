in summary , elevated serum strem-1 and pct levels provide superior prognostic accuracy to other biomarkers . combination of serum strem-1 and pct levels and sofa score can offer the best powerful prognostic for sepsis mortality . in the future , in order to improve the accuracy of the prognosis of sepsis , the combination of novel biomarkers and traditional markers of sepsis , reflecting different aspects of sepsis , is an attractive advice and is worthy of further investigation .
the roc analysis showed that the accuracy of the pct , strem-1 , il-6 , apacheii , and sofa scores on day 1 for the prediction of 28-day mortality was moderate ( auc > 0.7 , p < 0.01 ) , whereas the accuracy of nt - pro - bnp , crp , and il-10 was low ( auc < 0.7 , p > 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ) . comparing auc of pct , strem-1 , and il-6
the purpose of the study was to compare the prognostic value of biomarkers and cytokines versus clinical severity scores and improved death risk prediction .
recently , pct , strem-1 , crp , and nt - pro - bnp cytokines were widely used to diagnose sepsis and reflect the severity , but the results were not the same .
