the immune response to infections , immunizations , and tumors in the elderly is quite different from that in young people .
we found a significant reduction in the rate of cd3+t cells related with age , but no significant change in cd19 + b cell rates ( p<0.005 ) .
study participants were 70 healthy individuals from 3 different age groups , observed from january 2010 to january 2012 .
our study shows that there may be differences between males and females in terms of immune senescence .
our aim in this study was to investigate how lymphocyte subgroups in peripheral blood are affected by aging among males and females .
participants were divided into 3 different groups according age : group 1 ( n=20 ) was 2545 years old ( 10 males , 10 females ) , group 2 ( n=25 ) was 4565 years old ( 12 males , 13 females ) , and group 3 ( n=25 ) was older than 65 years old ( 13 males , 12 females ) .
another noteworthy result was that the level of cd8+t cells was lower in males compared to females and varied by age group ( p<0.005 ) .
