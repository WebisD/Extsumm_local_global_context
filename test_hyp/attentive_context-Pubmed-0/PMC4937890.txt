we report herein a case of an aggressive , chemotherapy - resistant immature teratoma harboring foci of sarcoma , melanoma , adenocarcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma .
somatic - type malignant degeneration is a rare but well - recognized phenomenon that occurs in the settings of gcts . due to its rarity , distinct nature , and remarkable heterogeneity ,
germ cell tumors ( gcts ) represent a well - recognized group of heterogeneous neoplasms with diverse clinical , histopathological , diagnostic , and prognostic characteristics .
this disease warrants comprehensive reporting of the clinical , radiological , and pathological features . in case of more - than - single transformation
even rarer is a gct with somatic malignant transformation , occurring in around 2% of all male gcts and in 10% to 20% of mediastinal teratomas .
immature teratomas , a subtype of gcts , are particularly rare in the mediastinum . in a review of 322 primary mediastinal gcts ,
a 21-year - old man was referred to our service from a local hospital for further management of a right hemithoracic extra - pleural mass with a provisional diagnosis of immature teratoma .
, the clinical outcomes and overall survival may well correlate with that of the most aggressive and poorest prognosis tissue type .
