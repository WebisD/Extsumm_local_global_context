we speculated that iber is an rpos - like regulator in sp gene expression in e44 . in order to dissect the 
 regulation of sp gene expression in e44 that is associated with the 
 pathogenesis of e. coli meningitis , a comparative proteomic analysis of 
 an iber deletion mutant ( br2 ) and its parent strain e44
our studies suggested that the iber gene was involved in 
 regulating sp gene expression related to stress resistance and pathogenesis .
we classified the proteins into two main categories on the 
 basis of their roles in the sp growth of e. coli cells : ( a ) response to 
 environmental modifications ( including tnaa , 
 tufb , ompc , ompa , and ahpc ) 
 and ( b ) central metabolism ( including lpda 
 and gapa ) . since iber was hypothesized as an 
 sp - regulator contributing to the growth regulation and virulence of e44 , its 
 role in the invasion process and resistance to stress conditions should be 
 further characterized .
the gene iber in e. coli k1 e44 is predicted as 
 the only regulatory protein present in the iberat operon in gima by 
 bioinformatics approaches . to determine the role of iber gene in 
 the growth - phase - dependent invasion of bmec by meningitic e. coli k1 ,
