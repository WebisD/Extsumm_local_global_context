we believe that using similar approaches with implantation induced intermixing may result in multi - color lasers with improved characteristics . in summary
, we have demonstrated multiple wavelength ingaas qd lasers using ion implantation induced intermixing . for a cavity length of 2 mm , the shift in the lasing wavelength of un - implanted and implanted devices is 40 mev . implantation followed by annealing of device structures used for achieving differential band gap shift alters the energy level spacing in the active - region , resulting in broader lasing spectra , higher threshold current densities and lower slope efficiencies with respect to the as - grown devices .
hence band gap tuning using ion implantation induced intermixing requires careful design of devices to minimize carrier loss from the qd active region .
we first demonstrate differential band gap shift and effect on carrier confinement and energy level spacing in qds due to ion implantation induced intermixing , using photoluminescence ( pl )
. then we report on multi - color qd lasers and discuss the effect of intermixing induced changes in confinement and energy level separation in the active region on the performance of the devices .
