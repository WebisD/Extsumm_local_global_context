recently , we experienced a case of hoa with a thymic carcinoma , and herein report the case with a review of the literature .
a 63-year - old woman was referred to our hospital because she had a chief complaint of both leg pains .
considering the possible relationship between serum vegf and the development of hoa , it may be suggested that hoa could be a poor prognostic sign in thymic carcinoma . in summary , we experienced a rare case of poorly differentiated thymic carcinoma associated with hoa and suggest a possible association between thymic carcinoma and hoa .
clubbing of digits , periosteal new bone formation along the shafts of the tubular bones of the extremities and synovial effusions characterize hypertrophic osteoarthropathy ( hoa ) .
primary hoa is a rare syndrome , not associated with other systemic diseases , and usually occurs in childhood , whereas secondary hoa is associated with various underlying pulmonary and non - pulmonary causes , such as bronchogenic carcinoma and right - to - left cardiac shunts . although various intrathoracic malignancies have been associated with the development of hoa , it has been extremely rare for hoa to occur in a patient with a malignant neoplasm of the thymus .
