this study evaluated the predictive power of illness type , the ill parent s depressive symptoms , family functioning , and adolescents gender and age on child report of stress in a sample of parents with a medical condition in the chronic stage .
all variances explained by the models were moderate , meaning that we identified important risk and protective factors for adolescent stress at the individual level ( i.e. , quality of parent attachment and adolescent gender ) and at family level ( i.e. , quality of parent - child interaction ) . in support of the fsi model
we found some support for the fsi model in the sense that family functioning is associated with adolescent stress , but this association does not seem to depend on parental illness type in the chronic stage . it is valuable to incorporate interpersonal family variables and adolescents gender in predictive models of adolescent stress .
our sample concerns parents with a medical condition in the chronic stage , so we will examine in which regard the fsi model may be a useful explanatory framework apropos of child adjustment ( adolescent stress ) to chronic parental illness .
the average scores for quality of parent - child interaction were very close to those of the normal population ( mean  =  88.82 , sd  =  6.59 ; lange 2001 ) , see table  4.table 4descriptive statistics for adolescent stress , parental depression , quality of marital relationship , quality of parent - child interaction and quality of parent attachmentmean ( sd)rangeadolescent stress34.66 ( 8.07)17.0 - 63.0parental depression12.19 ( 7.70)1.0 - 34.0quality of marital relationship62.01 ( 9.96)34.0 - 78.0quality of parent - child interaction88.99 ( 10.69)49.0 - 104.0quality of parent attachment38.89 ( 5.59)15.5 - 48.0 descriptive statistics for adolescent stress , parental depression , quality of marital relationship , quality of parent - child interaction and quality of parent attachment all independent variables ( parental depression ; quality of marital relationship , parent - child interaction , and attachment ; adolescent gender and age ) had a significant correlation with adolescent stress , but only quality of parent attachment showed a large correlation and all other correlations with adolescent stress ranged between small and medium ( cohen , 1992 ) , see table  5 .
