the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy , safety , and predictability of wf and cross - cylinder prk in moderateto- high astigmatism .
both methods of prk using the nidek ec-5000 and visx excimer laser systems are effective for correcting moderate - to - high astigmatism .
mean change in refractive astigmatism after 6 months was 1.57  0.53 d in the wf group and 1.67  0.52 d in the cross - cylinder group .
angle of error analysis demonstrated that both arithmetic means were slightly clockwise ( 0.71 and 1.26 ) and close to zero , which is consistent with the closeness of the vector mean tia and sia axes .
mean (  sd ) preoperative astigmatism measures were 2.91  1.3 and 2.51  0.98 d , respectively , in the wf and cross - cylinder groups .
total root - mean- square ( rms ) higher order aber rations were 0.05  0.22 m and 0.17  0.2 m for wf and cross - cylinder methods , respectively . for coma ,
the surgically - induced astigmatism ( sia ) vector , target - induced astigmatism ( tia ) vector , astigmatic correction index ( ci ) , index of success ( i0s ) , angle of error , magnitude of error , flattening effect ( fe ) , and flattening index were analyzed using methods described by alpins.10 sia is the vector of the astigmatic change actually induced by the surgery .
