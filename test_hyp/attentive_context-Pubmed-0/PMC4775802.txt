the second aim of the present study was to determine whether mt has a preventive effect on kidneys in diabetic rats ( drs ) with cin treatment .
the first group was comprised of healthy rats ( hrs ) , whereas the other four groups were made up of drs , diabetic rats with contrast - induced nephropathy ( cin + drs ) , melatonin - treated diabetic rats ( mtdrs ) , and melatonin - treated cin + diabetic rats ( mtcin + drs ) .
second , both kidney tissue and serum levels of oxs markers , inflammatory cytokines , and il-33 were found to be significantly diminished in mtcin + drs compared with the groups without mt treatment .
first , kidney tissue and serum levels of il-33 as well as other inflammatory cytokines and oxs markers were found to be significantly increased in drs , and further increase was also determined in contrast - applied drs .
inhibition of il-33 and oxidants with mt pretreatment offers therapeutic potential in contrast dye - applied diabetic patients .
inhibition of il-33 with mt provides functional and histologic protection against cin , demonstrating that il-33 might be a candidate for mediating cin in dkd .
