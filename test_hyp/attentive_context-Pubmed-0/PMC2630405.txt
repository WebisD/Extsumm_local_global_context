, we evaluated the influence of nrf2 genotype on the cerebral upregulation 
 of nf-b activity , proinflammatory cytokine , and icam-1 after tbi .
the most important finding of this 
 study is that nrf2 ( / ) mice had more inflammatory cytokines tnf- , il-1 and il-6 
 production , icam-1 expression , and their mediator nf-b activation in brain after tbi compared 
 with their wild - type nrf2 ( + /+ ) counterparts .
we found that nrf2 ( / ) mice are more susceptible to tbi - induced 
 cerebral nf-b activation , inflammatory cytokine 
 tnf- , il-1 and il-6 production , and icam-1 expression , which then contributed to exacerbated brain injury after tbi . to the 
 best of our knowledge , this is the first study that elucidates the interplay between nrf2 and proinflammatory nf-b signaling pathway in the brain following tbi .
tbi 
 induced upregulation of tnf- , il-1 , and il-6 in the cortex of both nrf2 ( + /+ ) and nrf2 
 ( / ) mice .
nrf2 ( / ) mice showed an increased 
 susceptibility to tbi - induced activation of nf-b than their wild - type nrf2 ( + /+ ) counterparts .
