the mean hr decreased significantly at all points of measurements ( 2 min after sedation , start of fiberscopy , after passage of ett , 2 min after ett ) compared to baseline in group ii patients ( p = 0.019 , 0.02 , 0.028 , and 0.03 , respectively ) , while in group i the fall in hr was insignificant at all measurement points ( p = 0.059 , 0.271 , 0.4 , and 0.163 , respectively ) .
thus , we recommend the use of low - dose ketamine plus dexmedetomidine combination for hemodynamic stability and better sedation during awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation .
comparison of vitals ( pulse , mean arterial pressure , oxygen saturation ) in between the groups the map decreased significantly at all intervals ( 2 min after sedation , start of fiberscopy , after passage of ett , 2 min after ett ) compared to baseline in group ii patients ( p = 0.038 , 0.003 , 0.000 , and 0.000 ) , and at 2 min after passage of ett in group i patients ( p = 0.000 ) .
sedation score was higher ( lower sedation level ) in group ii ( dexmedetomidine alone ) when compared to group i ( dexmedetomidine and ketamine ) which was statistically significant ( p = 0.015 ) .
