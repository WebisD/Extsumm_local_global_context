in 
 conclusion , acylated cyclic polyarginine peptides were synthesized 
 and examined as cpps and potential molecular transporters .
phosphopeptide ptyr - glu - glu - ile ( pyeei ) 
 is an optimal peptide ligand for binding to the src tyrosine kinase 
 sh2 domain . in this study , we used negatively charged fluorescein - labeled 
 phosphopeptide f-gpyeei as a model cell - impermeable compound .
acpps showed 
 higher potency as molecular transporter compared to the corresponding 
 linear counterpart and cyclic polyarginine without fatty acid .
the 
 mechanism of the peptide internalization was found to be energy - dependent 
 endocytosis .
we hypothesize that the combination of acylation 
 and cyclization of short polyarginine peptides having less than six 
 arginine residues will increase the intracellular uptake and can generate 
 peptides with molecular transporter properties . for convenience , square 
 brackets   and parentheses ( )
cyclization and acylation reactions on the structure 
 of the peptide enhanced the intracellular uptake of polyarginine peptides 
 although they carry a short length of sequence .
this is the first 
 report of cyclic fatty acylated polyarginine peptide as molecular 
 transporter of a cell - impermeable phosphopeptide .
this differential behavior of the peptides in normal , 
 and cancer cells can be possibly rationalized through the interaction 
 between polyarginine peptides and cell membranes .
