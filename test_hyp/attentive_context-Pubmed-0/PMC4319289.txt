the 16s rrna gene - based metagenomics study has identified for the first time co - prevalence of the bacterial genera  streptococcus , rothia , granulicatella , gemella , actinomyces , selenomonas , haemophilus and veillonella in the saliva of patients with polycaries lesions .
as 16s rrna gene - based metagenomics assay provides a rapid and broad spectrum analysis platform to reliably identify the microbial flora in a given sample in a quantitative manner , we used this technique to identify the existence of bacterial flora in the saliva of these subjects in relation to four unrelated control subjects without carious lesions .
the higher prevalence of other identified bacteria needs to be explored along with streptococcus , rothia and granulicatella on a higher sample size to determine categorically their extent of association with cariogenesis , and determine their usage as distinct caries specific bacterial signature to predict cariogenesis in high risk group .
the finding gains significance as the co - prevalence of streptococcus , rothia , granulicatella was observed in all caries patients , but not control subjects and hence is likely to be strongly associated with cariogenesis .
the present study describes the utilization of recent but well established 16s rrna gene - based metagenome analysis of salivary bacterial flora in two groups patients with polycaries lesions and dmft index > 5 and non - caries control group with dmft < 1 , to understand : ( 1 ) prevalence pattern of bacterial hierarchy , and ( 2 ) co - prevalence and comparative prevalence of bacterial genera among the groups .
