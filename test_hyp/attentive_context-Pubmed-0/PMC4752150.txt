in summary , our retrospective study provides three principal findings : for the vast majority of patients the foley catheter adequately drained the bladder ; there were no gender differences in the efficacy of the foley catheter in bladder drainage ; improper placement of a foley catheter can lead to significant urinary retention .
as such , the purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of the foley catheter in bladder drainage .
twenty nine men ( 40.3% ) had ruv=0 ml , 41 ( 57% ) had a residual urine volume of > 0 ml and < 50 ml , ( mean=4.9 ml , st dev = 7.0 ml ) , and 2 ( 2.8% ) had ruv > 50 ml ( mean=488.1 ml , st dev=362.8 ml ) .
we assessed residual urine volume ( ruv ) by utilizing the 5 mm axial section demonstrating the greatest bladder cross sectional area . using coronal multiplanar reformatted images to determine maximum bladder height ,
thirty nine women ( 41% ) had ruv = 0 ml , 54 ( 57% ) had a ruv > 0 ml and < 50 ml ( mean=8.0 ml , st dev=8.3 ml ) , and 2 ( 2% ) had ruv 50 ml , ( mean=301.4 ml , st dev=172.6 ml ) .
