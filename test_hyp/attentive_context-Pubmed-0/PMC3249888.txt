research on antibiotic resistance has been mainly focused on bacterial pathogens isolated from infections or in clinical settings . however , the fact that hgt - acquired genes originated in natural , non - clinically relevant microorganisms and that the first step in the transfer of resistance likely occurs in natural ecosystems emphasizes the need to analyze resistance in non - clinical ecosystems .
furthermore , the constant release of antibiotic resistance determinants already present in mges located in human pathogens , and in some circumstances associated with selective concentrations of antibiotics , may disrupt natural microbiota , which then serve as reservoirs for resistance genes .
non - culture based methods have demonstrated their value for the analysis of resistance in natural ecosystems . among them , functional metagenomics provides the means to identify novel mechanisms of resistance independently of whether they will be acquired by bacterial pathogens . on the other hand ,
bacterial pathogens can develop antibiotic resistance either by mutations , or by the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes from other microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer ( hgt ) . since bacterial pathogens were ( presumably ) susceptible to antibiotics at the time of the development of these compounds , it is reasonable to think that resistance genes have been acquired from non - pathogenic microorganisms .
