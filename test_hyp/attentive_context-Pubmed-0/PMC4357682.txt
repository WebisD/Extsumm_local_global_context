the presented case involved a 32-year - old woman with bilateral heel numbness due to bilateral neuropathy of the medial calcaneal nerve due to external compression during vaginal delivery .
a 32-year - old woman presented to our neurology outpatient clinic with tingling and numbness in both heels .
bilateral medial calcaneal nerve neuropathy as a result of external compression is a rare complication of epidural obstetric analgesia .
with an incidence rate of 0.92% , maternal puerperal lower extremity nerve injuries are rare .
lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy ( meralgia paraesthetica ) is the most common , followed by femoral neuropathy .
bilateral neuropathy of the medial calcaneal nerve due to external compression during delivery using epidural analgesia is very rare .
, a near - nerve needle conduction study of the medial calcaneal nerve was not performed .
nerve injuries are more likely to occur in nulliparae , in cases of prolonged stages of labour and assisted vaginal deliveries .
a diagnosis of bilateral neuropathy of the medial calcaneal nerve , most likely due to longstanding pressure on both heels with epidural analgesia as a predisposing factor , was made .
the first stage of labour was prolonged , and because of fetal compromise during the expulsion phase , a vacuum delivery system ( palmpump kiwi ) , together with episiotomy , was used for fetal extraction .
