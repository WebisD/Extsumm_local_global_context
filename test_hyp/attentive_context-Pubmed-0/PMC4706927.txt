so far , almost 60 compounds were newly synthesized and tested to check their activities by employing no assay and antiproliferative activity . of them , interestingly , kth-13-amine - diastereomer 1 [ 4-isopropyl-2,6-bis(1-phenylethyl)aniline 1 ( kth-13-ad1 ) ] has been reported to have stronger activity than that of the original compound in terms of anticancer activity ( data not shown ) . in this study , therefore , we further aimed to demonstrate the anti - inflammatory potential of kth-13-ad1 , a derivative of kth-13 , and to explore its mechanism of action using activated macrophages .
thus , the present study proposes that kth-13-ad1 , a chemical analog of kth-13 extracted from cordyceps bassiana , has clinical utility as an anti - inflammatory drug .
, we evaluated the dose - responsive activity of kth-13-ad1 on the phosphorylation levels of putative target proteins , p85/pi3k and src .
in summary , kth-13-ad1 demonstrated impressive suppression of inflammatory mediator production , including ros and no , without inducing cytotoxicity , while this compound strongly enhanced the phagocytotic uptake , suggesting that kth-13-ad1 is able to regulate cellular responses related to innate immunity .
we further established a method for total synthesis of this compound in order to facilitate its mass production and derivatization . in this study , we tested one ( kth-13-ad1 ( figure 1(a ) ) ) of its derivatives , specifically to see whether this compound is able to suppress macrophage - mediated inflammatory responses .
