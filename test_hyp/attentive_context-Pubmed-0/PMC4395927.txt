medical pluralism in india is specially relevant because of the richness of india 's medical heritage which offers a unique opportunity to integrate across 5 traditional systems of healthcare . a new national policy 2015 to replace the last policy formulated in 2002 is on the anvil .
experts have identified a host of operational issues and gaps that plague the public health system .
the public health system in india despite growing investments in every national 5-year plan ( 1.1% of gdp in 2012 ) and even after over 65 years of its functioning , has not yet delivered universal primary healthcare to the citizens of india .
, a very sensitive and long - term strategy is needed to revitalize and modernize india 's public health system and make it both integrative and much more participatory .
it is tempting to suggest here that the approach of modern medicine which starts at molecular level and progresses toward building systems , now referred to as systems biology , and the traditional medicine 's holistic understanding and approaches will intersect fruitfully if expertise and research are managed carefully leading to new and sustainable solutions and perhaps original contribution to the world of medicine and life sciences .
