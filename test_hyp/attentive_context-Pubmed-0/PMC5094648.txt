the danish registry of diabetic retinopathy ( diabase ) was established to monitor the development of diabetic eye disease in denmark and to evaluate the accessibility and effectiveness of diabetic eye screening programs with focus on interregional variations.9 the main aim of the registry is to enable evaluation of quality of care for patients with diabetic eye disease .
the diabase is a useful tool to observe the quality of screening , prevalence , and progression / regression of diabetic eye disease .
data analysis from diabase s latest annual report ( 20142015)11 reveals a decrease in the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy from 26% to 22% compared to the previous report ( 20132014 ) , whereas the number of patients diagnosed with diabetes has increased between 1996 and 2012.10 additionally , the proportion of patients with regression ( 20% ) is greater than the proportion of patients with progression ( 10% ) of diabetic retinopathy .
thus , it contributes to ensure a high quality of care for diabetes patients in denmark . reducing the overall morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes by preventing complications may help to relieve the large economic burden of the disease .
diabetic maculopathy is divided into three types , based on whether it causes focal , ischemic or diffuse edema , and may include tractional ( vitreoretinal ) or nontractional ( intraretinal ) components.3 the management of diabetic macular edema has advanced significantly with the introduction of anti - vegf ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) treatments.3 however , macular laser treatment still plays a major role in treating noncenter - involving macular edema.5 vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of visual loss worldwide and is an important cause of impaired vision and disability in the working - age population.6,7,8 advanced diabetic eye disease has a negative influence on quality of life.6 therefore , eye screening for the diabetes population aims to identify patients with early signs of sight - threatening disease to facilitate efficient treatment and prevent loss of sight .
