hlgdb aims to providing a useful resource to anyone studying the lysosomes and a tool for identifying common regulatory features of lysosomal genes .
hlgdb provides a user - friendly interface through which information can be easily retrieved , including the union and intersection of different gene lists , searches for mirna predictions and visualization on the gene transcript sequence of the mirna target predictions .
the human lysosome gene database ( hlgdb ) is the first searchable database focused on the census of genes belonging to the lysosomal system and on their regulation by mirnas .
several lists of lysosomal genes were collected from public gene databases , published proteomics articles and reviews edited by biochemists and cell biologists working in the lysosome field .
hlgdb was designed to become a lysosomal gene census . when new lysosomal genes will be discovered
we paid special attention on balancing predictions , which were as follows : ( i ) more suitable to look for confirmatory evidence ( targetscans ) ( 15 ) ; ( ii ) more suitable to identify any possible target for a particular mirna , to form the basis for in vitro or in vivo experiments ( pictar four - way and five - way ) ( 16 ) ; ( iii ) more suitable to find in silico evidence for the interaction between a mirna and a gene of a certain family or function ( pita , miranda ) ( 17 ) . to increase mirna - target mrna information , experimentally verified mirna targets from mirtarbase were also reported .
