koreich in 1981 first reported the case of a 22 year old man diagnosed as hodgkin lymphoma ( hl ) who developed hypothermia and hypotension during the course of his admission , which resolved only after initiation of chemotherapy .
we report the case of a patient who presented with hypotension and hypothermia and was diagnosed initially with septic shock .
systemic symptoms are present in a third of patients at presentation and among them fever is the most common followed by night sweats and weight loss . on review of literature , we found 18 case reports with similar finding of hypotension and hypothermia associated with hl .
most of the patients in these case reports developed hypotension and hypothermia after initiation of chemotherapy .
only 3 out of these 18 patients were found to have hypotension at the time of presentation prior to diagnosis .
he was found to have ill - defined liver lesions on the computed tomography ( ct ) scan which were new on comparison with a recent ct abdomen done for evaluation of nephrolithiasis .
a complex interaction between cytokines , tumor and blood vessels has been proposed as the genesis of such a presentation .
