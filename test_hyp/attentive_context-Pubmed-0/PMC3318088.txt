there is increasing evidence that higher levels of high sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) is a marker of inflammation and a potential independent predictor of cardiovascular disease , as it may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis , adversely affecting mortality.1)2 ) rate of obesity is increasing globally where studies have shown association of body weight as assessed by body mass index ( bmi ) with clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) in acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) patients.3 ) previous reports have also indicated that hs - crp level is correlated with bmi and fat distribution.4)5 ) the mechanism for elevation of plasma hs - crp in obese subjects could be through a high production of cytokines , e.g. , interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) , interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) , by excess adipose tissue which could induce high hs - crp production in liver.4 ) curently there is no data available evaluating the relationship between higher baseline hs - crp levels , body mass index ( bmi ) status , and adverse outcomes in patients with ami undergoing pci .
therefore , in the present study we attempted to assess the association between baseline hs - crp level and 12-month clinical outcomes in patients with ami .
