mutations in codons 12 and 13 of kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( kras ) and b - raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog b1 ( braf ) genes are frequently present in tumors of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( crc ) ; they are observed in 30 - 45% and 5 - 20% of cases respectively 1 .
although highly uncommon , identification of this dual tumor genotype is important , as current clinical trials are being designed enriching for patients whose tumors harbor either a kras or braf mutation , but haven't addressed those patients with coincident kras and braf mutations . due to the infrequent rate of coincident mutation , it is not known if these patients have a tumor biology distinct from kras or braf mutant tumors .
rarely patients may have crc with coincident kras and braf mutations ; herein we report three such cases and review of the literature .
under an institutional review board approved retrospective chart review protocol ( dr-11 - 0113 ) , we reviewed samples tested at a clinical laboratory for tumor kras and/or braf mutations from 2008 - 2011 .
a prior study has demonstrated that concomitant tumor mutations have been relatively frequently observed human crc cell line ; in this study , of 24 human crc cell lines , one cell line ( gp2d ) demonstrated mutations in both kras and braf oncogenes ( however the braf mutation was in the less frequently observed at the codon 529 site ) 3 . in an analysis of 250 patients tumor specimens with microsatellite stable disease , kras mutations were identified in 45.2% of primary tumors , and that concomitant kras and braf mutations were found in 10 lymph nodes ( 35.7% ) from a total 28 samples whereas only 3 of primary tumor with negative lymph nodes were positive for coincident mutation ( 2.3%)4 . there was also noted to be a higher proportion of concomitant mutations based on the degree of transmural penetration of the tumor ; 1/36 ( 2.8% ) for t2 tumors and 3/32 ( 9.4% ) for t4 tumors , suggesting activation of both genes is associated with progression of disease .
