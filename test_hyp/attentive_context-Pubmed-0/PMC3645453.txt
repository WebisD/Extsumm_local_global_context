the purpose of this study was , therefore , to investigate the influence of contamination with two different types of maintenance sprays on the microtensile bond strength ( tbs ) of dentin bonded with a 2-step self - etching adhesive system .
most commonly , a mixture of cohesive failure of the resin and failure of the adhesive interface / hybrid layer ( r&a failure ) was observed in each group .
the non - sprayed control showed significantly higher tbs than the two sprayed groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
nine caries - free extracted human molars stored in 0.5% chloramine t solution at 4c was used for tbs study .
there was no significant difference between the two sprayed groups ( oil - free spray ( n = 14 ) and oil - containing spray ( n = 15 ) ) ( p > 0.05 ) .
it has been reported that the spray contents was discharged up to at least 240 min , but the amount of discharge was gradually reduced.14 their results suggested that uniform discharging of spray contents into entire the dentin surface might be difficult . in this study , therefore , the spray was applied directly in order to contaminate the dentin surface , referred to rosa et al and matos et al.18,19 powers et al15 and knight et al17 evaluated the handpiece lubrication on bond strength of enamel using two multi - step etch and rinse adhesive systems ( all - bond 2 , bisco ; opti - bond fl , kerr ; and gluma 2000 , heraeus kulzer ) , and they found that the significant difference between the mean bond strengths for the group prepared with a sterilized unlubri - cated handpiece and the group prepared with a lubricated handpiece .
