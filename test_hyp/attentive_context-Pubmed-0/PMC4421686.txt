common variable immunodeficiency ( cvid ) is the most common form of severe antibody deficiency affecting both children and adults .
bacterial infections of the sinopulmonary tract , particularly sinusitis and pneumonia , are experienced by most patients with cvid . here ,
renal biopsy performed to evaluate nephrotic syndrome was also consistent with aa amyloidosis ( figure 2 ) . with the history of recurrent infections and low ig levels , she was diagnosed as having cvid leading to secondary amyloidosis .
a 29-year - old female patient was admitted with complaints of cough , fever , diarrhoea and swelling all over her body .
cvid must be kept in mind in patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections in order to prevent co - morbidities .
the disorder is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations , including infections , chronic lung disease , gastrointestinal ( gi ) disease and autoimmune disease .
the characteristic immune defect in cvid is impaired b - cell differentiation with defective secretion of immunoglobulin ( ig ) .
but there is no case with nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis documented with renal biopsy .
patients with late diagnosis and insufficient treatment of infections are prone to develop amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome which worsens the prognosis of the disease which has already high morbidity and mortality rates .
