this article makes the dermatologists aware of the growing resistance to terbinafine and stimulates further microbiological studies in this respect .
this article highlights the presence of resistance to terbinafine in our cases of tinea infections .
thus , there was no significant difference in the body surface area involvement when compared with the cured and the persistent disease groups ( mann  whitney u - test , p : 0.3908 ) .
thus , out of a total of 100 cases enrolled , only 65% could achieve both clinical and mycological cure after 2-week terbinafine therapy ( cured ) . over the 12-week follow - up ,
this study is aimed at documenting these cases of terbinafine therapy failure in patients of tinea corporis and/or tinea cruris .
the percentage distribution of various causative organisms involved at the end of oral terbinafine therapy , only 70 cases out of 100 were clinically cured while the rest ( 30/100 ) had signs of persistent infection at the treated site ( persisters ) . on repeat fungal culture ,
thus , at the end of 12 weeks , there were only 43 cases out of the total 100 cases enrolled who were able to maintain a long - term clinical and mycological cure after 2 weeks of oral terbinafine treatment [ table 2 ] .
