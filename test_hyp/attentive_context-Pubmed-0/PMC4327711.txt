thus , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of agreement of genotypic identification between ap- pcr reactions performed with distinct arbitrary primers ( opa 02 , opa 03 , opa 05 , opa 13 and opa 18 ) of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva of adult volunteers .
in conclusion , the results of the present study suggest that primers opa 02 , 03 , 05 and 13 were suitable for genotypic identification of s. mutans isolates of saliva from adult volunteers .
the amplification with opa 02 primer resulted in a higher number of bands ( mean of 11.9 ) , in relation to the other primers .
considering the proportions of genotypes in relation to the total number of isolates , in volunteer 8 , the predominant genotype was " h " ( 75% ) and the others , " i " and " j " , represented 12.5% each one of the 8 isolates of this volunteer . for volunteer 11 , the predominant genotype was " m " ( 87.5% ) and
li and caufield13 ( 1998 ) , after evaluating various arbitrary primers in the genotyping of reference strains of s. mutans , suggested that the primer opa 02 showed the best power of genotype discrimination , giving the highest number of amplicons when compared to other primers .
