we report an interesting and rather unique case of a brown tumor of maxilla and mandible developing after acute exogenous thyroxine poisoning in a young female patient under treatment for hypothyroidism and ectopic intrathoracic parathyroid adenoma .
our patient represents a rare case of brown tumor with a wide spectrum of associated clinical findings . in conclusion
brown tumor is a non - neoplastic giant cell lesion characterized by increased circulating levels of parathyroid hormone ( pth ) .
, the management of the brown tumor should involve early diagnosis , complete biochemical assay and full body skeletal survey followed by normalization of pth , serum calcium and phosphorus levels and parathyroidectomy , if indicated . in the absence of any pathology of anatomic parathyroid
a 23-year - old female reported to our department with the chief complaint of a swelling on the left side of the lower jaw for past 4 months producing facial asymmetry .
tertiary hpt is associated with renal failure and autonomous functioning glands in long - standing secondary hpt cases .
this case emphasizes the need for periodic biochemical investigations in the hypothyroid patients on exogenous thyroxine therapy .
the most interesting aspect of this case report is association of brown tumor with ectopic intrathoracic parathyroid gland with normal functioning anatomic parathyroid glands .
