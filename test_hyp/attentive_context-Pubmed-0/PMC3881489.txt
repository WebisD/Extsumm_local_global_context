therefore , the other purpose of this study was to reveal the differences in muscle activity 
 patterns during standing between younger and elderly patients .
the objectives of the present study were to elucidate 
 what type of compensatory movement and postural strategy are used by lower limb amputees for 
 posture control during the period from prosthesis fitting to hospital discharge by analyzing 
 the muscle activity patterns of the lower limb muscles and to elucidate the changes over 
 time in the muscle activity pattern during the course of physical therapy .
further studies with larger numbers of subjects 
 stratified by the causes and types of amputation are needed to clarify the specific factors 
 associated with the acquisition of the ability to walk by amputees , and the development of 
 efficient methods for physical therapy and programs .
therefore , physical therapy for lower limb 
 amputees should be focused on the prevention of falls during movement / walking for the 
 improvement of everyday activities . for this purpose , it is necessary to properly evaluate 
 the balance ability of amputees and to perform training to improve the balance ability based 
 on the results of that evaluation .
no muscle activity of ga was observed in 
 the standing position tasks in the first week , but the amount of muscular activity of ga 
 gradually increased over time . on the other hand , for the elderly subject , increased 
 activity of ga was observed in the forward weight shift task in the first week , when the 
 prosthesis was worn for the first time , followed by a gradual decrease in activity over time
