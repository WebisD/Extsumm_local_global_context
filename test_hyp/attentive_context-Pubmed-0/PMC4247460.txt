in summary , an 18 f catheter is sufficient to drain the bladder safely . a larger urethral catheter size during the intra - operative dissection in rlp appears to increase the risk for fossa navicularis stricture .
the data of 424 men undergoing rlp from june 2002 to may 2006 by a single surgeon were prospectively entered into an electronic database .
we describe the incidence of fossa stricture in our rlp series to determine its likely etiologic factors .
prior to surgery , all men were evaluated , and the following data entered into the database : age , height , weight , american urological association ( aua ) symptom score , urinary bother score , prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) , and pertinent medical history .
the mean follow - up was 26.4  months for stricture patients versus 22.1  months for stricture - free patients and 22.8  months ( range : 3.645.6 months ) for all patients .
urinary and functional outcomes were determined on the basis of self - administered questionnaires , including the seven - item international prostate symptom score , and selected questions from the 26-item expanded prostate cancer instrument composite , at the routine 3-month and 9-month follow - up visits .
