we present a patient with multiple lesions of gf and its response to topical tacrolimus .
granuloma faciale ( gf ) is an uncommon , benign , inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology .
a 35-year - old female presented to our department with a 5 year history of single , asymptomatic , grey - brown pigmented , nodule over the left cheek [ figure 1 ] .
our patient experienced a relevant improvement within 3 months of treatment with tacrolimus ointment after no response with intra lesional steroids , dapsone and cryo therapy . in conclusion
the disease is notoriously resistant to therapies and often tends to relapse when treatment is discontinued .
however , we did observe eosinophils in skin biopsy in our case , probably since the biopsy was taken after one year of oral dapsone .
, the previous reports and our observation suggest that topical tacrolimus may be a well - tolerated , efficacious therapy for gf .
skin biopsy is characterized by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of neutrophils and eosinophils in the dermis , in conjunction with small vessel vasculitis .
differential diagnosis includes lupus pernio , lupus vulgaris , lymphoma , discoid lupus erythematosus and deep mycotic infection .
