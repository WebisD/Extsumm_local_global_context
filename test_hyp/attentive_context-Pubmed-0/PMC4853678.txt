the aim of this study was to compare the bmd and prevalence of osteoporosis of postmenopausal korean women with low - energy distal radius fractures with those of aged - matched normal korean women .
regard , our results seems to be against the previous studies , which showed the prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with distal radius fractures to be higher than that of the control ( 3,14,15,16 ) . in this study , however , 106 new cases of 206 patients ( 51.5% ) of distal radius fractures were diagnosed as osteoporosis . the rates of newly diagnosed osteoporosis were 21 of the 71 patients ( 29.6% ) aged 50 - 59 years , 51 of the 93 patients ( 54.8% ) aged 60 - 69 years , and 39 of the 42 patients ( 92.8% ) aged 70 - 79 years . although the prevalence of osteoporosis of patients in our study was comparable with those of age - matched controls at all measured sites , except the ward s triangle ,
we analyzed the bmd and prevalence of osteoporosis in postmenopausal korean women with low - energy distal radius fractures .
in addition , low - energy distal radius fractures are predictive of future 15 years prior to osteoporotic hip and spine fractures ( 7,8,9 ) . considering these findings , it is important to analyze the relationship between bmd and distal radius fractures in postmenopausal women for the prevention of secondary fractures ( 10 ) .
