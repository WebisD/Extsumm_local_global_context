this research field provides an opportunity to integrate structural plasticity and functional plasticity at the cellular , circuit and behavioral levels and has attracted wide interest from basic scientists , clinicians , and society . in 2015 , the japanese association of anatomists and the physiological society of japan held a joint annual meeting in kobe , japan .
the broad scope of stem cell and neuro / gliogenesis study raises questions about inherent similarities and differences in the properties of nscs at different animal ages and in different brain regions , as well as in the process of neuro / gliogenesis in the developing , mature , and diseased brain .
a closer understanding of the nature of nscs and neuro / gliogenesis is therefore crucial to various aspects of neuroscience , including the development , remodeling , and restoration of brain architecture and function . stem cell and neuro / gliogenesis biology is also strongly linked to the plastic potential of the cns .
thus , stem cell and neuro / gliogenesis biology provides an ideal platform for the integration of structural and functional plasticity and will contribute to our understanding of the remarkable plastic potential of the cns .
