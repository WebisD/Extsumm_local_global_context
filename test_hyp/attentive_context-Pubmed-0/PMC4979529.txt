the diagnosis of peribiliary cystic disease should be considered in patients with end - stage liver disease who present with cholestasis and biliary ductal dilatation , along with negative biopsy of the biliary ductal system for malignancy .
we present a case of a patient awaiting olt , with a new finding of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation initially thought to be secondary to cca , but ultimately diagnosed as multiple peribiliary cysts .
peribiliary cysts may present a diagnostic challenge in the patient with end - stage liver disease , due to the possibility of being mistaken for cholangiocarcinoma   .
misdiagnosis of peribiliary cysts as cca in patients with decompensated cirrhosis may lead delay or denial in listing an otherwise suitable candidate for orthotopic liver transplantation ( olt ) .
our case , therefore , demonstrates the importance to the transplant community of being cognizant of this condition , and further suggests that a diagnosis of peribiliary cysts should be considered in patients with cirrhosis who present with intrahepatic biliary dilatations and obstructive jaundice . in conclusion , we present a case which demonstrates that peribiliary cysts may present with imaging findings concerning for cca .
imaging with mrcp and dic - ct can make a definitive diagnosis , though the degree of hepatic dysfunction may limit the usefulness of dic - ct .
