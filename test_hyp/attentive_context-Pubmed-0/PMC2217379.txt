first , calcium injection appears to activate the light - sensitive conductance , and the light - induced rise in cai has the necessary properties for it to play the role of an intracellular messenger of visual excitation .
the intracellular injection of calcium buffers has been used to examine the role of a rise in cai in generating the light response of limulus ventral photoreceptors . in a number of cases the inability of calcium buffers to block the response to
the purpose of the experiments described in this study was to determine whether ip3-induced calcium release is necessary for generating the entire light response of limulus ventral photoreceptors . for this purpose
how can it be that the rise in cai that activates the ion channels in the plasma membrane still occurs in the presence of calcium buffers injected to concentrations > 20 mm and after treatment with cpa , which makes the cai rise itself undetectable ?
thus , 2apb has the advantage , in limulus ventral photoreceptors , of inhibiting both ip3-induced calcium release and the current activated by the released calcium .
with mathematical modeling of the effects of calcium buffers on the rise in cai in a well - mixed compartment , together with the assumption that calcium influx into the compartment is sufficient to saturate the calcium buffer , these authors proposed that a rise in cai is necessary for generating the light response of limulus ventral photoreceptors .
