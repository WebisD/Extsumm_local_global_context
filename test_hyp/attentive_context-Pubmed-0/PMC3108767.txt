the aim of this review is to evaluate the potential role of glycosaminoglycans ( and in particular sulodexide ) as antiproteinuric and kidney protective drugs .
diabetic nephropathy is a highly important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus , either directly and as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.1 in particular , diabetic kidney disease occurs in 20% to 40% of patients with diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end - stage renal disease.2 recent evidence shows that an early multipharmacological approach is able to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy to end stage renal disease ( esrd ) , the disease rarely stops and slightly regresses just in few selected and optimally treated patients.3 in this context , there is a strong need for new agents able to significantly modify the patient disease history .
diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality , accelerating the vascular aging process and in particular the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
, sulodexide seems to be able to play an important role in the treatment of these patients because of its actions not only at the renal level , but also on the whole vessel tree , which is usually severely affected in diabetes patients with ckd . in conclusion , a relatively large body of literature supports the antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effects of gags and sulodexide ; however more basic clinical research is needed to understand which factors influence the drug s efficacy and , consequently , which patients could therefore benefit most from this treatment .
