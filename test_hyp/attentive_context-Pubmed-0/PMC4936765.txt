administration of shin'iseihaito ( ssht ; magnolia flower lung - clearing decoction ;  xn y qng fi tng ) is capable of improving allergic status in ova - induced allergic murine model .
thus , in the present study , we investigated whether ssht is able to suppress the murine allergic reaction induced by nasal sensitization .
further studies are required to confirm the anti - allergy effects and elucidate the mechanisms of anti - allergy action of ssht in allergic murine model .
in the present study , we showed that the administration of shin'iseihaito ( ssht ; magnolia flower lung - clearing decoction ;  xn y qng fi tng ) is capable of suppressing the ige and il-4 levels in murine allergic reaction induced by nasal sensitization .
3c ] . as we found that the eosinophilia and cytokine level of allergic mouse treated with ssht were remarkably decreased
the allergic mice treated with ssht had also significantly increased ifn- levels ( p  <  0.01 ) [ fig . 
the allergic rhinitis mice treated with ssht had significantly decreased eosinophil levels ( p  <  0.01 ) [ fig . 
the allergic mice treated with ssht had also significantly decreased il-4 levels ( p  <  0.01 ) [ fig .
