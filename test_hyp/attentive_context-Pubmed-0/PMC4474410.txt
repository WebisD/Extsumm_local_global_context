the aim of this study was to compare the performance of these advanced mr techniques , namely perfusion , diffusion and proton mr spectroscopy ( h - mrs ) with that of [ f]-flt - pet , by pre - operatively assessing the diagnostic accuracy of each parameter in differentiating glioma grades .
in conclusion , this study shows that [ f]-flt could be of interest in glioma classification particularly in differentiating grade iv glioblastoma from grade iii or grade ii gliomas .
this was also shown in our study , particularly between grade ii and grade iii gliomas ( p  =  0.03 ) . indeed ,
our work also illustrates the added value to acquire both , advanced mri and [ f]-flt pet , to overcome the limitations of conventional imaging for doubtful patients .
cho / cr showed significant differences between grade ii and grade iii gliomas ( p  =  0.03 ) .
mri plays a crucial role in the assessment of aggressiveness of gliomas before surgery but may remain insufficient to forecast prognosis of diffuse gliomas . therefore , multimodal imaging parameters with advanced mri ( cbv and adc ) , mrs and [ f]-flt - pet could identify relevant markers to better predict the grading of gliomas . among advanced technics ,
