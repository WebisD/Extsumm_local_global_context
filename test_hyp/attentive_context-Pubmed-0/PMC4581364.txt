in the present study , we demonstrated that aerobic exercise inhibits lung inflammation and pro - inflammatory cytokine release in lung tissue in an experimental model of pm10 carbon black - induced lung inflammation .
presented data in figure 2 demonstrate that pm10 carbon black exposure increased the gene expression tlr4 , nf-b and tnf- in lung tissue compared with all of the other groups ( p  0.05 ) and that aerobic exercise in carbon black pm10 exposure decreased the expression of these cytokine compared with the carbon black pm10 exposure group ( p  0.05 ) .
twenty four adult male wistar rats aged 8 weeks were obtained from pasteur institute of iran and randomly divided into the 4 groups : a ; control ( without exposure carbon black pm10 and aerobic exercise ; n = 6 ) , b ; aerobic exercise ( five times per week for 4 weeks ; n = 6 ) , c ; exposure to carbon black pm10 ( 5 mg / m ; per rat ; n = 6 ) , d ; aerobic exercise concomitantly with exposure to carbon black pm10 ( n = 6 ) .
presented data in figure 2 demonstrate that pm10 carbon black exposure increased the gene expression tlr4 , nf-b and tnf- in lung tissue compared with all of the other groups ( p  0.05 ) and that aerobic exercise in carbon black pm10 exposure decreased the expression of these cytokine compared with the carbon black pm10 exposure group ( p  0.05 ) .
