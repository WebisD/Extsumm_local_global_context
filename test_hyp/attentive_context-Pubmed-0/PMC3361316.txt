it seems that measurement of faecal calprotectin concentration can be a useful , safe , and noninvasive test in children suspected for ibd , since it is found to be increased in children with cd and uc as compared to patients with other inflammatory diseases ( eosinophilic , lymphocytic , and nonspecific colitis ) and also in the reference to healthy subjects . when the faecal calprotectin concentration is increased in children with less common types of bowel inflammation , a further follow - up of such patients
faecal calprotectin concentration correlates positively with the disease severity in cd and uc patients ; thus , it may be useful when choosing or modifying the appropriate treatment regimen .
the aim of the study is to assess the usefulness of faecal calprotectin measurement in children with various types of ibd and to evaluate fc concentration in children with crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis in relation to disease activity .
faecal calprotectin concentrations were within the normal limits in patients with eosinophilic , lymphocytic , and nonspecific colitis , similarly to the healthy subjects ( table 1 , figure 1 ) in children with cd , faecal calprotectin concentrations positively correlated with the disease severity assessed according to the pcdai scale . in patients suffering from uc , faecal calprotectin
