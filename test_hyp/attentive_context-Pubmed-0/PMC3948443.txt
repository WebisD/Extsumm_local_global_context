a 52-year - old male patient with a height of 163 cm and a weight of 65 kg was admitted to the hospital due to right femoral edema , and following a diagnosis of right femoral abscess , an incision and drainage procedure was performed . with regard to medical history ,
the perioperative administration of dantrolene may cause a delay in the recovery of muscle relaxation in a dose - dependent manner , and the timing of preoperative administration is especially important as it is associated with the serum dantrolene concentration .
however , there are individual differences in pharmacokinetics . for the use of a muscle relaxant , neuromuscular monitoring
therefore , for patients taking a high dose of dantrolene , it is helpful to consider the half life of the medication when making decisions about the timing of medication discontinuation .
reported the case of an 8-year - old patient who had been taking oral dantrolene 20 mg daily for the treatment of spasticity for 2 years prior to an operation .
the authors confirmed that long - term administration of oral dantrolene for the treatment of spasticity does not significantly affect the muscle relaxant action of rocuronium . regarding the induction of muscle relaxation in the second operation ,
