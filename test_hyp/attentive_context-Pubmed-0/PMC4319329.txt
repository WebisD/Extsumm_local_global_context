, no other reports addressing the disastrous effects of x - ray radiation have been documented in the literature since 1960s . the present report , however , documents a case of thumbs carcinoma of a dental radiographer due to his neglect of radiation protection guidelines .
in august 2010 , a 49-year - old male working as a dental radiographer , lost his distal phalanges of both thumbs as a result of development of squamous cell carcinoma , due to neglect of the guidelines of protection related to x - ray imaging .
dental radiography doses and risks are minimal unless dealt without being cautious , which is the case of the radiographer presented here .
during the early years that followed the discovery of x - ray , radiographers were unintentionally , incautious when dealing with it because of its unknown biological harmful effects .
moreover , many early workers in the field of dentistry suffered from radiation - induced ulceration , dermatitis and malignant tumors in their fingers . with strict compliance to the radiation protection guidelines , issued by the international commission on radiological protection ( icrp ) , diagnostic radiography is considered a safe practice .
