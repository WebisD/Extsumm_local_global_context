in the current study , we examined the relationship between physical activity variety , defined as the number of different types of self - reported moderate - to - vigorous activities performed in one week , and minutes spent in objectively measured moderate - to - vigorous physical activity ( mvpa ) in two groups of individuals who have successfully maintained their body weight long - term : ( 1 ) weight loss maintainers with previous history of overweight / obesity and ( 2 ) normal - weight individuals without a history of overweight .
similarly , logistic regression analyses showed that greater physical activity variety ( or = 1.78   , p < 0.001 ) , weight loss maintainer status ( or = 0.23   , p = 0.002 ) , and lower bmi ( or = 0.81   , p = 0.01 ) were independently associated with meeting the 250 mvpa minutes / week guideline for optimal weight maintenance .
this study examined whether performing a greater variety of different types of moderate - to - vigorous physical activities was related to greater time spent in mvpa among weight loss maintainers and normal - weight individuals without a history of overweight / obesity .
