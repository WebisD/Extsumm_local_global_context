in summary , we have demonstrated how a 
 systematic approach based 
 on first - sphere active site mutagenesis , high - throughput p450 fingerprinting , 
 and fingerprint - based p450 reactivity predictions can provide an efficient 
 solution to the problem of developing p450 catalysts with fine - tuned 
 site - selectivity for the oxidative activation of multiple , isolated 
 sp c  h bonds in a complex molecule . by guiding 
 and
focusing our search for the desired catalysts across a large engineered 
 p450 library , this method allowed us to accomplish our goal of refining 
 the site - selectivity of a p450 enzyme in a time- and cost - effective 
 manner . to our knowledge , the complete inversion in stereoselectivity 
 achieved with ii - h10 ( 100% ee ( r ) from 78% ee ( s ) in fl#62 ) , the absolute regioselectivity and stereocomplementarity 
 obtained with the iv - h4/ii - h10 pair , and the regioselectivity shift 
 achieved with x - e12 to afford the selective hydroxylation of a primary , 
 nonallylic / nonbenzylic c  h site ( 7%  94% ) remain unprecedented 
 in previous p450 engineering efforts .
have emerged with respect to the active site positions 
 and mutations responsible for steering the selectivity of these enzymes 
 toward each one of the three , spatially close sp c  h 
 bonds in c7 and c6a of artemisinin ( figure 1b ) .
