we present here a preliminary study of the efficacy and safety of milnacipran in a series of patients complaining of occlusal discomfort and diagnosed as suffering from phantom bite syndrome .
we report here the results with 7 patients who came to the department of dentistry and oral surgery at the fukuoka university hospital in japan in 20032004 complaining of occlusal discomfort and diagnosed as suffering from phantom bite syndrome .
phantom bite is , however , a chronic syndrome and the promising effects seen here after 4 weeks need to be followed up over a much longer time period .
overall , the occlusal discomfort felt by the patients was considerably decreased between baseline and week 4 ( table 2 ) .
scores of 0 improvement were therefore used for this patient for the sds and vas analyses ( table 2 ) .
the level of depressive symptoms was also decreased as indicated by a 47.8% decrease in sds .
this suggests that milnacipran may be an effective and well tolerated treatment for phantom bite in oral psychosomatic disorder patients .
three patients reported adverse effects ( headache , dizziness , and nausea , table 2 ) .
patient 6 was unco - operative and refused to complete the vas and sds self - rating evaluations at the end of the study .
