the sample included 45 subjects ( 15 in each group ) the mod - ssi score showed statistically significant reduction for all three groups reflecting patients improvement in muscle pain with hard , soft , and liquid supported splints .
, this study was carried out to study the efficacy of hard , liquid , and soft splints in the management of myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome .
the results for objective palpation also showed statistically significant difference between baseline and 90 days for all three groups , i.e. , hard , soft , and liquid splints .
however , hard splints were more effective in shorter duration of time followed by liquid splints and lastly soft splints [ tables 1 and 2 , figures 4 and 5 ] . means and sd for mod - ssi and digital palpation for the three groups p values for mod - ssi and digital palpation scores between hard , liquid and soft splint groups at different intervals mean of modified symptom severity index scores at each intervals for all three groups mean of digital palpation scores of all muscles at each intervals for all three groups
the results showed that all three types , i.e. hard , soft , and liquid occlusal splints reduced the mod - ssi scores and digital palpation scores thereby proving that the type of splint did not have an effect on the overall results among the three groups .
