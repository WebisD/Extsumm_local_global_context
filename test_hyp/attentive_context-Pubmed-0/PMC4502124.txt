under the limitations of this study , deep dry ct with 24 h soaking period increases the martensite content of sm niti alloy without altering the grain size . by correlating our previous experiments and the current findings , deep dry ct with 24 h soaking period
therefore , the aim of this preliminary study was to investigate the role of dry ct conditions on the microstructure of martensitic sm niti alloy .
the specimens were randomly divided into four experimental groups based on the soaking temperature and time with a control group as follows : dct 24 group : 185c ; 24 h , dct 6 group : 185c ; 6 h , sct 24 group : 80c , 24 h , sct 6 group : 80c , 6 h and control ( ctrl ) group : no treatment .
could be recommended as a supplementary method in the manufacturing in order to extend the life of sm niti endodontic instruments .
experiments were conducted on ni-50.8 wt% ti sm alloy with austenite finish temperature ( af ) of 46c in the form of sheet ( 2.2 mm thickness ) and rod ( 9 mm diameter ) of same ingot which complies with the specifications of american society for testing materials ( astm ) f2063 - 05 .
