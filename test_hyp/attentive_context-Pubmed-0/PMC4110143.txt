we present a case in which a highly radiosensitive sntcs was associated with elevated -hcg .
sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma ( sntcs ) is a very unusual and aggressive neoplasm first characterized as a separate entity by heffner and hyams in 1984.1 it is currently defined by the world health organization as  a complex malignant sinonasal neoplasm combining features of teratoma and carcinosarcoma  that typically includes benign and malignant epithelial , mesenchymal , and neuroepithelial elements including immature tissue with blastomatous features.2 unlike other malignant mixed germ cell tumors ( gcts ) , sntcs lacks embryonal carcinoma , yolk sac tumor , choriocarcinoma , and seminoma components .
based on an inadequate sample , this heterogenous tumor can be misdiagnosed as olfactory neuroblastoma , squamous cell carcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , malignant salivary gland - type tumors , or adenosquamous carcinoma.2 a recent comprehensive review of the literature by wei et al revealed  <  60 cases reported in the english literature.3 the primary treatment in 82% of the cases reviewed was surgery , with or without adjuvant radiation therapy ( rt ) .
overall , 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 36% and 25% , respectively , for those patients with reported outcomes.3 of all the reported cases of sntcs , only one has shown any hormone secretion : antidiuretic hormone , causing hyponatremia.4 in that case , sodium levels were a reliable marker of tumor control and were an early postoperative indicator of tumor recurrence . to date , no sntcs with elevated gct markers has been reported .
