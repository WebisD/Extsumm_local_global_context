the impact of this protocol on hcv viral load at one year was insignificant , and although there was a tendency for later hcv recurrence and lower incidences of rejection , we also observed a higher dropout rate and a lower patient survival rate with tacrolimus and daclizumab compared to tacrolimus and steroids
we therefore used hcv viral load as a surrogate indicator of hcv recurrence because of the potential difficulty in differentiating between acute rejection and hcv disease after transplantation . to test the effect of a steroid - free regimen , we compared two tacrolimus - based protocols : one with steroid administration for 3 months ( the reference treatment ) and the other with daclizumab in which steroids were avoided for both prophylactic immunosuppression , and wherever possible , antirejection treatment ( experimental treatment ) : we assumed that hcv recurrence would be lower with the steroid avoidance regimen .
results of the post hoc analysis , which excluded patients who had taken antiviral medications for treatment of hcv , indicated an even smaller between - treatment difference in viral load in the primary analysis set but a significant difference in the full analysis set .
more cases of severe fibrosis , as evidenced by a score of 4 , were assessed in the tac / dac arm ( 4 of 35  biopsies ) compared with the tac / str arm ( 0 of 54  biopsies ) .
