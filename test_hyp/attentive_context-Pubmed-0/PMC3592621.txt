cpr was used in two neuroscience courses : an introductory neuroscience course ( 50 students , 86% first - years and sophomores ) and an upper level sensation and perception course ( 40 students , 95% juniors and seniors ) . in the introductory course , students wrote one summary essay based on a scholarly review and one argumentative essay based on a primary research article . in the upper level course , students composed two summary and synthesis essays and one argumentative essay , all of which were based on primary research articles of increasing sophistication .
instructors determine weight of grading components ; for both classes i weighted text 15% ( 5% each essay ) , the accuracy of three peer reviews quality 60% , the accuracy of the three calibration reviews 15% ( 5% each essay ) , and the accuracy of the self review 10% .
indeed , one of the downfalls of traditional instructor review is that comments by instructors detract students attention from their own intentions in writing , and focus that attention instead on  the teachers purpose in commenting 
results of the student evaluations indicate that cpr fostered a multi - dimensional comprehension of the course material while teaching traditionally underserved academic skills : science writing and peer review .
