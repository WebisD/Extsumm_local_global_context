multivessel coronary disease ( mvd ) , a leading pathological foundation of intermediate to very high risk clinical manifestation , accounts for approximately 3040% nste - acs cohorts overall and is usually treated with invasive interventions.4 ) the american college of cardiology / american heart association guidelines provide a class iib recommendation that multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) , in contrast to culprit - only pci , might be reasonable in nste - acs patients undergoing pci ( level of evidence : b).3 ) this recommendation is based on reports of studies suggesting that multivessel pci is superior to culprit vessel only pci in terms of repeat revascularization.5)6)7)8 ) however , there is still uncertainty as to whether non - culprit lesions should be treated at the time of culprit - lesion pci for nste - acs.3 ) in the present study , we sought to examine clinical outcomes of " one - time " versus staged multivessel stenting in intermediate to very high - risk nste - acs patients with mvd .
for the 90-day to 3-year follow - up period , both the incidences of mace ( 17.9% vs. 19.1% , p=0.641 ) and the composite of cardiac death or mi ( 6.3% vs. 8.7% , p=0.191 ) were similar between the two groups .
