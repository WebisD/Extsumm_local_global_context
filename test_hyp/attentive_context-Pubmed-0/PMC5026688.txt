, ,   the current study was designed to assess the in vitro activity of bensal hp against a broad range of contemporary pathogens , including mdros such as mrsa , vancomycin - resistant enterococcus , gram - negative so - called superbugs , mycobacterium fortuitum , nocardia brasiliensis , yeasts , and filamentous fungi .
bensal hp is a very - broad - spectrum topical antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against important pathogens such as mrsa , pseudomonas aeruginosa , gram - negative superbugs , yeasts , and filamentous fungi .
in addition , the finding that bensal hp was not compromised by mechanisms of antibiotic cross - resistance between it and other classes of antimicrobials is of interest . of note , multidrug - resistant acinetobacter ,
the most important finding was that all 184 bacteria , yeasts , and filamentous fungi tested were susceptible to the clinically used concentration of bensal hp , indicating that it has a very broad spectrum of activity compared with other topical agents .
carlstadt , nj ) is a combination topical ointment with antimicrobial properties with activity against methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) and common bacterial and fungal skin pathogens .
