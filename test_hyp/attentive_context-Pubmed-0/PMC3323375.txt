finally , this study represents a short - term ( 7.3 months average ) evaluation of protective effectiveness of three doses of the hantavirus vaccine . to assess the long - term effectiveness , protection
the protective effectiveness of the vaccine strongly depends on the number of doses . in particular , effectiveness increased when persons for whom > 1 year had passed since their second dose were excluded , which suggests that the protective effect of the second primary vaccination does not persist beyond the period recommended for having the booster dose .
in addition , we do not know whether the recommended immunization schedule was optimal for military personnel and farmers , groups for whom hantavirus vaccination is recommended .
the vaccination schedule should be epidemiologically relevant , immunologically effective , operationally feasible , and socially acceptable ( 7 ) . in a field study from the former republic of yugoslavia conducted by korean researchers , including the developers of the hantavirus vaccine ( 8) , no case of hfrs was observed among 1,900 vaccinees , while 20 confirmed cases were observed among 2,000 nonvaccinated controls .
considering that our study showed low protective effectiveness for one or two doses , that no case of hfrs occurred in yugoslavian vaccinees before they received the full three doses was surprising .
