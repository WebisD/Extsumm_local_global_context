colonization with mrsa seems to be widespread in dutch pigs ; supplier farms that sell mrsa - colonized pigs to other farms play a role in spreading the organism . because the netherlands exports pigs to other countries , further research on the prevalence of mrsa in pigs in foreign countries is warranted .
currently , no precautions are taken before and during slaughter of mrsa - positive pigs . in conclusion
further research is necessary to identify the source of mrsa on farm b. since 2002 , human mrsa isolates sent to the national institute for public health and the environment by the regional laboratories are typed by pfge , and nontypeable mrsa in persons who are not in contact with pigs is rare .
however , to our knowledge , ours is the first report of culturing mrsa from clinically diseased pigs .
the isolation of mrsa from piglets with exudative epidermitis was unexpected . that large numbers of s. aureus but no s. hyicus were cultured from the skin lesions indicates clinical relevance .
because farm b regularly sells gilts to farm a , farm b is probably the source of the mrsa isolated from farm a. farm b is a closed farm that has not purchased pigs since 1996 .
