the driver and modulator framework adds a unique perspective to our ongoing understanding of the central auditory pathways . as such , these properties
we have used these properties to characterize several pathways in the central stages of auditory processing , and to identify the likely routes for auditory information flow from the ic through thalamus to the auditory cortex ( lee and sherman , 2008 , 2009b , 2010 ; llano and sherman , 2008 ) .
, how do these properties extend across systems and species ? indeed , the utility of this framework is not constrained to the auditory modality , as its relevance in other sensory systems has already been established ( reichova and sherman , 2004 ; petrof and sherman , 2009 ) , but has not yet been extended to non - mammalian species . in this respect , a comparative approach that extends the investigation of these properties in other organisms may lend unique insights into the ontogeny , development and evolution of the sensory pathways in higher organisms .
