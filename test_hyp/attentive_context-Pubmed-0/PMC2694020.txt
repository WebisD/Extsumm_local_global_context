we report a superficial keratomycosis caused by the filamentous fungus , beauveria bassiana ( b. bassiana ) , and its successful treatment with voriconazole ( vcz ) .
an 80-year - old woman struck her left eye with the frame of her glasses . due to continuing ocular pain and hyperemia , she was referred to our hospital 9 days after the original injury .
vcz proved to be a powerful tool that not only was successfully used in the current case , but also in the future might be an agent that can be used therapeutically to treat similarly infected types of patients .
our patient had a long history of recurrent diabetic iritis and continuously used topical corticosteroid .
a corneal scraping smear indicated the presence of gram - positive fungal septate hyphae with budding ( figure 2a ) , which led to a diagnosis of keratomycosis by filamentous fungus .
this immunocompromized situation also triggered the colonization of the fungi . in conclusion , a weak pathogenic filamentous fungus with zig - zag rachis and budding , as determined by smear , may account for b. bassiana .
unfortunately , these are frequently misdiagnosed as a bacterial corneal infection ( suzuki et al 2004 ) . here ,
