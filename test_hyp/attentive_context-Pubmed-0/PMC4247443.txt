herein we report a case of postoperative acute renal failure in a patient who had undergone robot - assisted prostatectomy .
however , postoperative acute renal failure ( arf ) is a rare complication in laparoscopic surgery and has not been reported in robotic surgery .
patients with prolonged surgery ( > 5  h ) , morbid obesity , and pre - existing renal function impairment are at higher risk of the development of rhabdomyolysis . minimizing the operation time , adequate patient padding , and intraoperative circulation maintenance are helpful in the prevention of postoperative acute renal failure .
a 63-year - old man presented with adenocarcinoma of prostate , clinical stage t1c , preoperative serum psa level 7.21  ng / ml , gleason score 3  +  2 , and serum creatinine level 1.3  mg / dl and underwent a robot - assisted prostatectomy .
there is no strong correlation between ck and arf from literature review , and the possibility of rhabdomyolysis in this patient should still be considered . in conclusion , we report the first case of acute renal failure after robot - assisted radical prostatectomy .
the most common complications include ileus , deep vein thrombosis , and pulmonary embolism   .
