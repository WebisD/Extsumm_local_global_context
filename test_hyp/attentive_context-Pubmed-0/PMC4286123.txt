this suggests that tia-1 can act as a splicing and translational regulator of vegf - a and alternative splicing of tia-1 may lead to enhanced angiogenesis and tumour growth in colorectal cancer , and resistance to anti - vegf - a therapy .
here we identify a novel k - ras dependent endogenous splice variant of tia-1 , short tia-1 ( stia-1 ) in crc patients and cancer cells , which controls vegf - a isoform expression .
binding of tia-1 to the vegf rna was shown , but it is also possible that other vascular growth factors are regulated by tia-1 , although these have not yet been published . in summary , we show that alternative splicing of tia-1 in human colon cancer may regulate the balance of the pro- and anti - angiogenic vegf - a isoforms , and control tumour growth and angiogenesis in animal models .
this is the first demonstration that this splice variant may be present in human cancers , and that it may regulate vegf splice form expression .
this is supported by the findings that ras inhibition in 10c cells was more effective at lower doses than in ls174 t cells , and that the rna and protein levels of vegf - a165b in the presence or absence of shtia-1 are not directly correlated .
