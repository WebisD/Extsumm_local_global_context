, we will review ( 1 ) the inflammatory mediators that increase during periods of sleep loss and their association with general disturbances in peripheral endothelium and epithelium and ( 2 ) how those inflammatory mediators might alter the blood - brain barrier during sleep loss . with the evidence presented in this review , we propose a hypothetical mechanism by which sleep restriction could induce blood - brain barrier disruption , emphasizing the effect of inflammatory molecules on tight junction maintenance .
almost all of our knowledge about the effect of inflammatory events on blood - brain barrier is related to chronic diseases or acute events , in which exacerbated responses to pathogens are present .
the role of low - grade inflammation in the generation or exacerbation of neuropathologies is recently explored because several conditions such as obesity and diabetes concur with this inflammatory status during long - term periods and , perhaps , it may be related to systemic and central comorbidities .
sleep loss per se , including sleep deprivation , sleep restriction , or sleep fragmentation ( see table 1 for a full differentiation between the concepts ) , generates a pathogen - independent low - grade inflammatory status . here
