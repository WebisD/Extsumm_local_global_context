patients presenting to the outpatient clinic of our department with a diagnosis of cu from february 2010 to february 2011 were assessed for any underlying cause by means of a proper clinical examination and relevant investigation and those with no identifiable cause were assessed for the presence of autoantibodies by performing an asst .
the mean tss recorded in responders was 12.8  2.2 against 14.1  2.2 in the non - responder group [ table 2 ] .
auto - hemotherapy ( injection therapy with the patients own blood ) was shown to have a beneficial role in cau patients . in another
the simplest screening method to identify the group of patients with cau is the autologous serum skin test ( asst ) .
autologous serum therapy does not seem to offer any significant therapeutic benefit in patients with chronic urticaria.only a minority of patients show a temporary response to the treatment option and this positive response does not last beyond the treatment period . 
 
only a minority of patients show a temporary response to the treatment option and this positive response does not last beyond the treatment period .
about two - thirds ( 40 out of 59 ) of our patients did not show any response to the treatment regimens with no significant change in their tss while on treatment . only 19 patients out of the total of 59 ( 32% ) showed some response by way of a reduction in their tss while they were on treatment with the weekly injections .
