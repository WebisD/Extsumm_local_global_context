diagnostic fibreoptic bronchoscopy without sedation with transcricoid injection of lignocaine can be recommended as a safe method of anaesthetising the respiratory mucosa , which is well tolerated by the patients with negligible side effects and provides acceptable conditions for the bronchoscopist as compared to the  spray as you go  technique .
the total dose of lignocaine used in group ii ( 372.6624.90 mg ) was significantly higher than that used in group i ( 3149.32 mg , p<0.001 ) as shown in figure 1 .
the age of patients in group i ( 51.6614.08 years ) was comparable with that in group ii patients ( 48.2613.32 , p = ns ) .
ii , the systolic blood pressure increased significantly from the baseline when measured 5 min after the procedure ( p<0.02 ) . similarly , as shown in table 2 , the pulse rate was comparable in both the groups before starting the procedure ( p = ns ) , but it increased significantly in group ii when measured 5 min after the procedure .
the patients of the specified age group coming to the bronchoscopy suit , requiring only diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage over a period of 6 months , were selected and alternatively divided into two groups of 30 each .
