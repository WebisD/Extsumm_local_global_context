that the amphioxus genome was crucial to the understanding of the origin of the human genome maybe was not clear to funding agencies but it was for the human genome consortium , as in the landmark human genome paper in 2000 2 :  our results so far are insufficient to settle whether two rounds of wgd occurred around 500 myr ago   .
european agencies failed to fund ( or we european researchers failed to convince the agencies of the importance of the amphioxus genome ) .
the year 2006 may be remembered in history as  the year of the amphioxus  .
this second part focuses particularly in the nervous system , one of the major steps forwards to the complexity of vertebrates .
another approach to determining whether a widespread duplication occurred at a particular time in vertebrate evolution would be to sequence the genomes of organisms whose lineages diverged from vertebrates at appropriate times , such as amphioxus ) .
most of the amphioxus researchers that have fought for the genome and the embryos are giving their particular data or views in their particular area of research .
a number of outstanding scientists outside the amphioxus community also gave support to the proposal ( the list is available in ref 1 ) .
