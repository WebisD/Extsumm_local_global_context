, in english language . with regard to lacking of appropriate measurement tool for patients with diabetes in persian ( farsi ) language , this study aimed to provide evidence for the psychometric properties of the iranian ( persian language ) version of dnt-15 .
however , there are different tools to measure hl and numeracy skills in general population in different languages , only diabetes numeracy test-15 ( dnt-15 ) has been developed specifically to measure numeracy skills in patients with diabetes as first scale by huizinga et al .
patients with low hl may benefit from interventions that address numeracy , particularly in the setting of diabetes management .
