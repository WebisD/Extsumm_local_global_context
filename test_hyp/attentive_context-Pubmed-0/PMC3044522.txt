relative incidence of campylobacter infection in each year compared with that in 1990 among patients > 60 years of age infected with selected gastrointestinal pathogens , england and wales , 1991 - 2007
data on all campylobacter isolates obtained from fecal or lower gastrointestinal tract samples , reported in england and wales from 1990 through 2007 , were extracted from the national laboratory database ( labbase ) and stored in a microsoft access ( microsoft corp . ,
the absence of a similar change in the age distribution of laboratory - reported salmonellosis or cryptosporidiosis from the same population suggests that this is unlikely to be a surveillance artifact .
relative incidence of campylobacteriosis by sex , region , and season , compared with rates of salmonellosis and cryptosporidiosis , among patients > 60 years of age , england and wales , 19912007 .
we report a striking change in the population at risk for campylobacteriosis in england and wales , which is independent of gender , geography , or season .
finally , although the incidence increased only moderately among those 1019 years of age ( rr 1.02 [ 95% ci 0.981.07 ] ) and 2059 years ( rr 1.04 [ 95% ci 1.031.06 ] ) from 2005 through 2007 , greater increases were observed for those 09 years ( rr 1.12 [ 95% ci 1.081.17 ] ) and those > 60 years ( rr 1.33 [ 95% ci 1.291.36 ] ) . during the surveillance period , therefore , the incidence among patients > 60 years of age , compared with the incidence among younger patients , increased markedly ( rr 0.45 [ 95% ci 0.440.47 ] in 1990 to rr 1.17 [ 95% ci 1.151.19 ] in 2007 ) .
