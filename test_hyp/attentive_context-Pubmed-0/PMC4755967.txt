therefore , the purpose of this study 
 was to test the hypothesis that toe flexor muscle strength is related to the anatomical and 
 physiological csa of intrinsic toe flexor muscles and that these morphological and 
 functional variables associate with physical performance .
the main findings of the present study were that physiological csa of the fdb was 
 significantly correlated with tfs-4-toes of both men and women ; physiological csa of the fdb 
 was significantly correlated with tfs-5-toes of women , but not that of men ; there was a 
 significant correlation between toe flexor muscle strength and maximum walking speed in both 
 genders . in the present study ,
both tfs-5-toes and tfs-4-toes correlated 
 positively with the maximum walking speed of men ( r = 0.584 , p = 0.014 and r = 0.553 , p = 
 0.021 , respectively ) , women ( r = 0.748 , p < 0.001 and r = 0.533 , p = 0.028 , respectively ) 
 and the whole sample ( r = 0.535 , p = 0.001 and r = 0.459 , p = 0.006 , respectively ) . however , 
 the correlations between tfs-5-toes and functional reach of both men ( r = 0.399 ) and women 
 ( r = 0.166 ) were not significant ( p>0.05 ) .
