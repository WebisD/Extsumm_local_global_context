there are similarities between children and adults suffering from heart failure ( hf ) , such as the preferred pharmacological treatment ( 1 ) , the use of pace - makers and heart transplants ( 2,3 ) , the inability of the patient to reach the predicted heart rate for the patient 's age during cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( 4,5 ) , and the ergoespirometric response under similar clinical conditions ( 5 ) . in adults ,
children at risk of developing cardiomyopathy exhibit endothelial dysfunction ; however , the prevalence of endothelial dysfunction in cardiomyopathic children remains unknown because of the lack of data .
these diseases may increase the likelihood of cardiovascular events ( 18 ) and may predispose children to the development of cardiomyopathy . based on these considerations , we reviewed the published literature on endothelial function in pre - pubertal children to evaluate the endothelial function in pre - pubertal children with cardiomyopathy or children at risk of developing cardiomyopathy , and we conducted an analysis of the data from the relevant studies .
the severity of endothelial dysfunction is related to the cardiovascular risk ( 14 ) , the severity of cardiovascular symptoms ( 15 ) , and the inability to exercise ( 11 ) and represents a predictor for cardiac transplant and death ( 16 ) .
