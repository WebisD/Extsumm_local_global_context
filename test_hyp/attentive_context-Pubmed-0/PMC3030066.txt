, a case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis after wedge resection of the lung is described .
the increased susceptibility of tissue to damage in older patients and the use of a dlt have been identified as possible causes of the paralysis . when faced with stridor in a patient who has undergone lung surgery using a dlt ,
, many reports have been published about unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paralysis after general anesthesia , but it is uncommon for paralysis to occur in patients who have undergone lung surgery with a dlt . in this case , we could suspect two possible causes for the paralysis : first , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury during the operation , and second , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury occurring due to intubation with a dlt .
a 67-year - old man , 164.5 cm in height and 64.7 kg in weight , was admitted to the hospital for investigation of abnormal shadows on chest x - ray in both lungs .
bilateral vocal cord paralysis should be considered as an etiology , and a prompt fiberoptic laryngoscopic examination should be done .
we can rule out the surgery - related injury , because the surgeon did not perform a sternotomy and manipulate the nearby origin of the internal thoracic artery , which is where the left vagus nerve passes .
