we report a case of an 18-year - old girl with hcm and aborted scd and implanted with an icd .
fqrs should be tested in a larger series of patients as a possible new risk factor and predictor of arrhythmic events in patients with hcm .
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( hcm ) is a genetically heterogeneous heart muscle disorder characterized by myocardial hypertrophy in the absence of abnormal loading conditions .
fragmented surface electrocardiogram ( ecg fqrs ) has been identified as a useful risk marker in other clinical conditions ; however , its use in arrhythmic events in patients with hcm has not been suggested .
the challenge for clinicians is to identify the small cohort of patients who are at a higher risk in order to target potentially lifesaving therapy such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( icd ) .
while it has been recognized for many decades that some patients with the disease die suddenly from ventricular arrhythmia , data from contemporary studies suggest that the annual risk of sudden cardiac death ( scd ) is in the range of 1% .
this is the first report of a patient with hcm and rapidly progressive fqrs , with documented malignant ventricular arrhythmias treated by an icd .
