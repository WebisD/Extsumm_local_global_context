unstapled laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair yields equivalent results in terms of complications and early recurrence when compared with results with the stapled technique , and the unstapled procedure merits evaluation in a larger study population .
although isolated studies have proven the effectiveness of unstapled laparoscopic hernia repairs with the total extraperitoneal technique ( tep ) , literature pertaining to this issue is meager and the incidence of recurrence remains the main concern . the present study compares the results of stapled and unstapled laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal herniorraphy with the reference to postoperative complications , chronic groin pain , and early recurrence .
patients with incomplete , reducible inguinal hernias who consented to participate in the study were randomized into 2 groups by using the sealed envelope technique as follows : group 1 ( stapled ) and group 2 ( unstapled ) .
one patient expired 2 years after hernia repair due to myocardial infarction , and another was lost to follow - up early in the study ( after 3 months ) both in groups 2 .
four patients ( 3 in the unstapled and 1 in the stapled group ) developed seromas .
nine patients underwent bilateral hernia repair in the stapled group , and 4 in the unstapled group .
