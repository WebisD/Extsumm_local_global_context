n. gonorrhoeae strains with combined resistance to penicillin , tetracycline , and ofloxacin increased from ( 0% ) in 1992 to ( 70.8% ) in 2009 ( p - value for trends < 0.01 ) .  
the results of our study demonstrated increasing trend of resistance in n. gonorrhoeae against penicillin , tetracycline , and ofloxacin in pakistan .
thus ongoing surveillance of resistance is important considering the public health importance of gonococcal infections . in this study , we have evaluated antimicrobial resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae for the years ( 20072009 ) and compared it with previously reported data ( 19922006 ) . additionally ,
an increasing trend of resistance was observed against penicillin , tetracycline , and ofloxacin ( p - value for trends < 0.01 ) ( table 1 ) .
. majority ( 93% ) of organisms were isolated from urethral , high vaginal , and cervical swabs , ( 6% ) were from pus aspirates , and ( 1% ) were from eye swabs , blood , and urine . during the study period ,
susceptibility to cefotaxime , cefoxitin , cefuroxime , cefipime , ceftazidime , ceftizoxime , cefixime , cefpodoxime , spectinomycin , and azithromycin was determined in 100 isolates .
