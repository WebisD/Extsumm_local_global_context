crisprfinder is a web service offering fundamental tools for crispr detection , including the shortest ones , allowing an accurate definition of the dr consensus boundaries and extraction of the related spacers .
it offers also additional tools to analyze the crispr loci : ( i ) obtain the crispr and the flanking sequences according to flexible size ; ( ii ) make a blast of selected spacers or flanking sequences against the genbank database and ( iii ) check if the dr is found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes .
a specialized program to automatically identify crisprs seems to be mandatory for their optimum , rapid exploration and in - depth analysis , in order to increase the efficiency of crisprs investigations .
crisprfinder is a program that allows the identification of structures with the principal characteristics of crisprs , the smaller being composed of a truncated or diverged dr , a spacer and a complete dr . in their analysis ,
these observations and the viral origin of spacers have led to the hypothesis that the crispr - associated system ( cass ) is a prokaryotic defence mechanism against genetic aggressions ( 10,13,16 ) . within species , crisprs may be present in a subset of strains , where they sometimes show polymorphism .
