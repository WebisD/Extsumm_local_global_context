the 
 aim of the study was to investigate the effect of liaison nurse on patient outcomes after 
 icu discharge .
however , the results of 
 the independent - samples t - test showed that the difference between control and intervention 
 groups in terms of body temperature was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) .
the results of the chi - square test 
 revealed that the intervention and control groups did not differ significantly in terms of 
 demographic characteristics such as gender , education , employment , reason for 
 hospitalization , and history of previous hospitalization in icu ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .   the results of the independent - samples t - test showed that there were no significant 
 differences between the two groups regarding heart rate , respiratory rate , systolic blood 
 pressure , post - icu level of consciousness , satisfaction with care , and the length of 
 hospitalization in medical - surgical wards ( p>0.05 ) . results of variables associated with 
 hospitalization of patients are shows in table2 .  
, 
 contradictions in terms of the effect of liaison nurse strategy on patient outcomes can be 
 attributed to factors such as differences in patients clinical conditions , complexity and 
 diversity of post - icu care , differences in the length and the types of liaison nurses 
 interventions , and differences in the types , scale , and the management systems of the 
 settings of the studies
