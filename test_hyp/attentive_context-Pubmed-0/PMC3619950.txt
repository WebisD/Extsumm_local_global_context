insight into this phenomenon and its links to human telomere biology will significantly advance the understanding of aging - related diseases in modern humans .
the pac effect on the health of offspring and , more broadly , on public health , requires fundamental re - thinking and new directions in research .
lastly , it is clear that the enigma of the father s age and the health of his offspring are bound to engage telomere researchers , evolutionary biologists , epidemiologists , and demographers for quite some time .
we discuss here the evidence for a beneficial effect of increasing paternal age at conception ( pac ) on the health of descendants .
if so , this would represent a substantial addition to haldane s conceptualization of the evolutionary force of male - biased mutations and the subsequent recognition that the evolution of dna sequences is largely driven through the numerous replications of the male germ line . because tl at birth and its rapid attrition during early life strongly influence tl throughout the human life course , an understanding of the pac effect on offspring tl requires going straight to the source , namely , tl at birth and its attrition during childhood . ongoing studies , exemplified by the avon longitudinal study of parents and children ( alspac ) in the uk and the norwegian mother and child cohort study ( moba ) , might be used to achieve this goal in a cost - effective manner .
