these data resulted from heterologous microarrays of target rna samples derived from rat mammary gland during distinct stages of pregnancy and lactation in order to extrapolate and enhance the understanding on transcriptional module networks or coregulated functional gene groups conserved in rodents and in the development of the mammary gland in humans .
dissection of unique patterns of expression of orthologous clusters of genes among species throughout distinct physiological time points along pregnancy and lactation could prove useful in the integrative analysis of the information available for discerning the molecular events underlying the regulation of mammary gland development and function that lead to milk synthesis . in this study ,
we demonstrated that data analysis strategies such as the combination of orthologous gene expression profiles and chromosome mapping in conjunction with directed promoter transcription - factor binding - site prediction presented here can add strength to conclusions and help identify systems and responses that are conserved across the mammal taxa .
we found distinct blocks of significantly differentially expressed genes within different cytogenetic regions of the rat with homologous chromosomal segments in human and mouse .
the argument may be made against the feasibility of using rodent data to draw inferences to human mammary gland gene expression . however , our objective in this study was to utilize the best available sources of information such as rat gene expression data during mammary development and mapping data to develop hypotheses on putative functional gene blocks conserved across species , underlying similarities despite reported differences in the architecture and hormonal control of mammary glands between rats and other rodents and between rats and humans   . in an effort to further characterize potential highly coregulated gene blocks , we combined transcription - factor binding - site prediction   along the promoters of each gene member with the detection of expression profiles of annotated altered transcripts categorized as nucleic acid binding protein .
