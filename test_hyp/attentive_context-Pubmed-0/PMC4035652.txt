we report a case of a large and symptomatic stpc in a 47-year - old female patient who was treated successfully with spleen - preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy .
clinical and pathologic information was collected for all of the reported pancreatic cysts , and a database was formed .
solitary true pancreatic cysts ( stpcs ) , or epithelial cysts , are benign lesions that are extremely rare in adult patients . advances in radiographic techniques have improved the ability to identify pancreatic cystic lesions .
we also review the clinical and pathologic features of all reported stpcs within the past 25 years .
to compose the review , we did a search of the international literature for stpcs that had occurred in adults .
cystic lesions of the pancreas are relatively rare , although they are considered an increasingly important category with a challenging differential diagnosis .
the mean age of occurrence is 43.2 years , and the mean cyst size is 5.6 cm
stpcs are extremely rare , benign pathologic entities , but the finding of a symptomatic or nonpancreatic cyst is still a diagnostic dilemma . imaging , endoscopic techniques , and tumor marker assays may partially resolve the problem , but a final diagnosis is still made only by histopathologic examinations of the specimen after surgery .
