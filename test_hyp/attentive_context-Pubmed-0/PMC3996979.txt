therefore the present study was taken up with an aim to study the virulence factors and antifungal susceptibility profile of c. tropicalis isolated from various clinical specimens .
fluconazole resistance was more common in isolates obtained from cases of candidemia , opc , and vulvovaginal candidiasis .
maximum isolates demonstrated resistance to fluconazole ( 71.2% ) followed by ketoconazole ( 68% ) .
a review of the available literature has revealed a dearth of information regarding the epidemiology , pathogenesis , virulence factors , and antifungal susceptibility patterns of c. tropicalis .
coagulase production was noted in 18 ( 14.4% ) isolates . of these , only 2 isolates showed coagulase expression within 4  h of incubation .
the importance of early and accurate identification of infecting candida species along with susceptibility testing for timely institution of appropriate therapy can not be overstated .
icu stay , total parenteral nutrition ( tpn ) , prior exposure to fluconazole , and diabetes mellitus were the major risk factors for candidemia .
c. tropicalis exhibit a great degree of variation not only in their pathogenicity but also in their antifungal susceptibility profile .
increased incidence of systemic candidiasis along with antifungal resistance has become an important healthcare issue worldwide .
