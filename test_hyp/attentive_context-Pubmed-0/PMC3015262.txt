the latter reason prompted this experimental study , which was carried out to evaluate whether a previously described intracorporeal approach to sigmoid resection could be facilitated and applied to the rectum in a porcine model .
ten domestic pigs with a median weight of 40.7 kg ( range 38.5 - 43 kg ) were anesthetized with intubation and ventilation with halothane . prior to surgery
the present study shows that a previously described intracorporeal approach to sigmoid resection can be facilitated and applied safely to the rectum in a porcine model .
nevertheless , completely laparoscopic colorectal procedures have been adopted in clinical practice by a limited number of surgeons .
, this approach requires a third stapler ( in addition to endoscopic linear and circular staplers ) , re - establishing pneumoperitoneum twice , and manipulation of an open - surgery stapling device with laparoscopic graspers .
transection of the rectum at a lower level can be achieved inserting an open - surgery articulating stapler through a suprapubic incision . however
all subjects were turned into a steep head - down position in addition to a right lateral tilt until no small bowel was seen in the field . a surgical technique previously described for laparoscopic sigmoid resection with intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis and specimen removal via a suprapubic incision
