we focused on using markers for detecting cell death in neurons , loss of myelin and loss of neurofilaments in axons , and , activation of astrocytes and microglia / macrophages .
thus , this systematic study is informative regarding the optimal dti mr imaging parameters to probe axonal injury following hypoxic / ischemic brain damage in developing brain in addition to aiding our interpretation of dti parameters for detecting various stages of wallerian degeneration .
dti measurements were made at acute , subacute and chronic times after hypoxia  ischemia along with processing of brains at each of these time points to assess immunohistochemically potential contributions of morphological modifications .
we report detailed differences in the progression and magnitude of dti and histological changes that provide a reference for identifying the potential contribution of various cellular responses to fa and axial , radial and mean diffusivity .
in order to better understand the unique cellular and dti imaging alterations associated with secondary wallerian degeneration relative to the onset and progression of direct ischemically damaged brain , it is necessary to compare their progression directly at multiple time points . in the current study we hypothesized that dti imaging would provide measures of progressive tissue changes within axonal tracts distal to the ischemic injury distinct from those in directly injured brain ( e.g. cerebral cortex ) and these differences would correspond with specific tissue morphological alterations in response to ischemia
