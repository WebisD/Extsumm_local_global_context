, the present authors gathered the views and experiences of those at the early stages of their academic careers ( masters- and phd - level researchers in public health ) in order to capture some of the experiences of a new generation of computer literate and internet - savvy practitioners and researchers .
one attempt , conducted by the lancet in 2000 , surveyed international editorial advisors ( comprising senior academics with obvious insights into academic publishing ) and describes some of the challenges faced by researchers , concluding that information flow , research , publication capacities and indeed health are intimately linked ( 21 ) . by surveying end - users in 2005 from settings where access to literature and to publication is potentially limited
this small series of case studies reflects recognition among study respondents of their need to use and contribute to global knowledge in order to advance professionally .
all must assume responsibility for directing the flow of global health information in both directions and this should be seen as a vital part of effective scientific communication , enabling effective global public health action .
inclusion criteria were residence in a resource - poor setting and participation in health - related research activities . given the geographically dispersed nature of the sample and in order to maximise response , a mixed - methods approach ( drop - and - collect self - completion surveys ; email self - completion surveys ; face - to - face structured interviews ) was used to gather information on participants views and experiences of access and contribution to medical literature ( 22 ) .
