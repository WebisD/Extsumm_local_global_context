a 90-year - old woman was referred to our hospital for acute appendicitis complicated with right incarcerated groin hernia .
most reported cases have documented the development of significant complications , since it is difficult to diagnose this rare entity preoperatively .
the literature is reviewed and the radiologic findings and management of this rare entity are discussed .
the ct features of typical acute appendicitis and incarceration of inflammatory fluid - filled hernia sac without evidence of intestinal obstruction should raise suspicion of this rare entity .
the reported incidence of appendicitis within a groin hernia is 0.13% of all cases of acute appendicitis.1 it most frequently occurs in the right inguinal and right femoral hernias .
selective use of ct for evaluating an atypical case of incarcerated femoral hernia may be helpful in early diagnosis and decision on the treatment strategy .
our case illustrates a very rare variety of femoral hernia appendicitis . the appendix was not contained in the hernia sac . instead
she initially presented to a local hospital with right lower quadrant abdominal pain for one day .
the differential diagnosis is acute appendicitis complicated with a rare complication of pus - filled femoral hernia or a richter s hernia . as illustrated in our case , the awareness of the ct findings facilitated the decision on a treatment strategy .
