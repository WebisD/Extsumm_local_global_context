the esr results clearly identify the c3 formation 
 in one - electron oxidized gemcitabine and the production of c2 
 in one - electron oxidized mefdc .
160170 
 k. thus , our study in one - electron oxidized mefdc provides the first 
 evidence of formation of c2 ( via the unstable intermediate 
 c3 ( reaction 5 ) ) in a nonenzymatic 
 system even at low temperature.5
this f loss is a 
 barrierless reaction between the 2-f - atom and the proximate 
 h3o which was formed via deprotonation of h3 
 in the cation radical .
theoretically , 
 dft calculations support the mechanism involving a h3o induced barrierless conversion of c3 to c2 
 in one - electron oxidized mefdc .
however , experimental and theoretical results shown 
 in this work have clearly demonstrated that in our system ( supercooled 
 homogeneous glassy solutions ) , c3 in gemcitabine does 
 not convert to c2 on annealing up to 170 k owing to 
 theoretically predicted barrier of greater than 5 kcal / mol .
these calculations show 
 that in the case of one - electron oxidized mefdc , the lowest energy 
 path is the rapid formation of c2 from c3 
 via f loss .
, it is expected that the negative 
 inductive effect ( i ) of two highly electronegative f - atoms 
 at c2 should increase the acidity of h3. from our 
 previous work on nucleoside cation radicals , the gemcitabine cation radical formed upon one - electron oxidation 
 is expected to produce c3 after deprotonation of the 
 acidic proton h3. in this work , esr spectroscopy has been 
 employed to investigate one - electron oxidation of gemcitabine and 
 other 2-modified derivatives , for example , 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-c - methylcytidine ( mefdc ( psi-6130 ) ; scheme 2 ) and 2-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine ( 2-fdc , scheme 2 ) , in order to test the influence of 2- 
 substituent on radical site formation .
