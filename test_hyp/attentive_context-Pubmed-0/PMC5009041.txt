we use a combination of preoperative intravenous iron infusion , intraoperative red cell salvage , and topical txa . a proactive approach to blood management
will lead to a positive effect on early and long - term outcomes and greater success in care of tka patients .
a critical component of successful patient care in total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) is a blood management strategy .
effective blood conservation encompasses optimizing preoperative red cell mass , salvaging blood lost during the perioperative period , minimsing blood loss with hemostatic measures and individualizing the transfusion trigger according to the patient 's clinical status and medical comorbidities .
thereby the risk of transfusion is removed , hemoglobin ( hb ) status and oxygen carrying capacity is maximized , leading to a positive effect on the patient 's recovery and both early and long - term outcomes .
a blood management program in tka aims to reduce allogenic transfusion rate and its associated risks , whilst at the same time maximizing hb level and oxygen carrying capacity in the postoperative period .
two recently published studies highlighted the benefits of evidence - based , multidisciplinary , multimodal approach to optimizing care in joint replacement patients potentially requiring allogenic transfusion1213 ) .
