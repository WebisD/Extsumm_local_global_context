intravesical instillation of bacillus calmette - guerin ( bcg ) is an established option for the treatment and prophylaxis of non - muscle - invasive bladder cancer .
, we present a patient who underwent intravesical treatment with bcg and subsequently developed penile lesions and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy .
side - effects of bcg usually occur when bcg is given immediately after transurethral resection of a bladder tumor , or when the patient had a traumatic catheterization or concurrent cystitis during intravesical instillation .
low - grade fever and irritative bladder symptoms are common side - effects of intravesical bcg instillation therapy . penile lesions or balanitis as complications of bcg treatment
physicians should be aware of the possibility of bcg - induced granulomatous balanitis and concomitant adenopathy .
the pathologic diagnosis was pta , g2 transitional cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ ( who 1973 ) .
treatment is followed by a four - month continuation phase with only two drugs , rifampicin and isoniazid . in our case ,
however , occurrence of balanitis is uncommon and only a few cases of balanitis associated with bcg instillation have been reported .
bcg - induced penile ulcer and adenopathy is a rare complication of intravesical bcg therapy , treatment for this disease is not yet standardized .
