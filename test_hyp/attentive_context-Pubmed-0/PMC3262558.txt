this has arisen because of better understanding of breast cancer behaviour and improved efficacy of combined therapeutic modalities . in this paper
we report the current guidelines concerning the management of the axilla after slnb and review the different aspects arising from recent studies on the role of micrometastases and itc clusters in sln on decision making .
for patients with operable breast cancer , the major prognostic determinant is whether there has or has not been spread to the axilla and the number of involved axillary nodes .
recent studies aiming to determine if calnd is beneficial in patients with sln - positive breast cancer and even more in patients with minimal sln involvement have reached contrary conclusions .
limitations in the published studies include the methods of pathological evaluation of lymph nodes and that the number of additional non - sln - positive nodes is usually not known
traditionally the surgical management of breast cancer comprised wide local resection of the primary tumour and axillary lymph node dissection ( alnd ) .
there may be two different breast cancer cell populations , true stem cells that have the capacity to develop metastases and the nonstem cells that never grow and are finally destroyed .   at the level of everyday clinical practice , with both promising and disappointing results of the published studies
