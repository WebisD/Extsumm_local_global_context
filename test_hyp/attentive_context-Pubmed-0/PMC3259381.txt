the primary focus is on ccta with a review diagnostic accuracy , appropriate clinical indications and limitations for evaluation of the coronary arteries .
although the principle indication for cardiac ct is most often for evaluation the coronary arteries , ccta is often requested for the dual purposes of non - coronary and coronary evaluation .
recent advances in ct imaging methodology and ct image reconstruction algorithms address many of these concerns .
the advent of multislice ct technology with ecg - gating along with innovations in x - ray tube and ct detector technology have resulted in revolutionary progress in cardiac imaging .
numerous studies suggest that ccta is a cost - effective alternative to the nuclear stress test and diagnostic cardiac catheterization .
several of the more common non - coronary applications are reviewed , although a complete review of these applications is beyond the scope of this pictoral essay .
ecg - gated ct angiography with 64 + slice systems has demonstrated efficacy for the diagnosis of coronary disease , cardiac morphology , and valvular assessment .
recent studies suggest additional applications of ct for assessment of myocardial perfusion and cardiac event risk . among the clinical applications of cardiac ct , coronary ct angiography ( ccta )
