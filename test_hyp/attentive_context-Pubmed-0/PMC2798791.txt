this information is best obtained from randomized controlled trials conducted clinically and in the laboratory for a definitive assessment of dental materials.6 hence , the purpose of this study was to evaluate 12 month clinical performance of a nanohybrid and a low - shrinkage posterior resin composite in class i and class ii restorations .
it was concluded that nanohybrid ( grandio ) and low - shrinkage posterior composite ( quixfil ) demonstrated acceptable clinical performance after 12 months .
the percentages of alpha scores for color match were 95% ( n=39 ) for grandio restorations and 100% ( n=41 ) for quixfil restorations .
quixfil restorations marginal adaptation score was alpha for 40 restorations ( 98% ) and bravo for 1 restoration ( 2% ) at the end of 12 months ( p=0.368 ) .
mainly , the difference between the restorative materials ( grandio and quixfil ) at the end of 12 months was not statistically significant and demonstrating acceptable clinical performance . at the 6-month recall all the restorations received alpha score with respect to each evaluation criteria .
the alpha and bravo scores of grandio restorations for surface texture were 40 ( 98% ) and 1 ( 2% ) , respectively ( p=0.368 ) .
