putting emphasis on redox signaling during apoptosis will undoubtedly open new windows of investigation and allow the characterization of useful biomarkers of cell death .

i by ga and gb following human killer cell attack has been implicated in ros - dependent bacterial death , suggesting that cleavage of complex i subunits is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of ros - dependent death .
how many ros are needed ? which radical species are most effective for the various contributions of ros to cell death ?
