. limitations of influenza screening include the high proportion of asymptomatic infected travelers ( 5 ) , incubation of infections acquired before or during a flight ( 3 ) , reliance on self - identification , limitations of case definitions , and limitations of thermal scanning ( 6 ) . modeling data have shown that the ability of border screening to delay global pandemic influenza is closely linked to the effectiveness of the screening process or travel restriction used . to delay influenza spread by 1.5 weeks , border restrictions need to reduce imported infections by 90% ( 7 ) .
we hope that during this interepidemic period , a major international review of the role of international air travel in the dissemination of emerging infectious diseases will be conducted to identify effective interventions .
this form of border screening is therefore unlikely to have substantially delayed spread of the pandemic into new zealand in 2009
such a review should consider systemwide approaches , including exit screening , standardized health declarations , active screening of individual passengers ( including use of rapid laboratory tests and thermal scanning ) , passenger tracking , policies and practices that support sick travelers wishing to defer travel , and circumstances where airline travel should be suspended entirely .
