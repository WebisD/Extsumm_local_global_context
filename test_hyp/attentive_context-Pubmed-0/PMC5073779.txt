we came across two cases in a very short window of about a month at a rural health center .
a rare , potentially fatal and usually self - limiting adverse effect of therapy with enalapril , the angioedema , is always a challenging encounter for an intensive care specialist .
incidence of enalapril - induced angioedema is three times more common in population of african origin .
the unpredictability of clinical course and the risk of airway compromise with not so high end airway management gears at hand make it more challenging in a rural health setup .
a 74-year - old female was admitted to the emergency department of sekghoma memorial hospital , serowe village , botswana , past midnight with progressive swelling of her face , tongue and breathing difficulty for about 8 h. the family gave a history of change of antihypertensive medication recently .
we recommend that in case of life - threatening enalapril - induced angioedema in rural setup , where advanced airway management procedures may be difficult , we must give an early thought about starting fresh - frozen plasma .
botswana provides universal health care to its citizens , and health sector is almost completely under government management .
