data analysis detected no significant changes in the posterior corneal curvature at 1 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery compared with preoperative values ( f = 1.47 ; p = 0.226 ) .
using a rotating scheimpflug camera , our study demonstrated posterior corneal surface stability 12 months after surgery in patients who underwent fsl - lasik for myopia and myopic astigmatism .
anterior chamber depth was stable 1 month and 6 months after fsl - lasik surgery but a significant reduction was observed 12 months after surgery ( 0.03  0.07  mm ) ( f = 4.25 ; p = 0.007 ) ( bonferroni test : t = 2.94 ; p = 0.005 ) .
the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the posterior corneal surface in eyes which underwent fsl - lasik for myopia and myopic astigmatism over a twelve - month follow - up period in order to highlight any eventual postoperative forward shift .
the mean preoperative spherical equivalent was 5.05  2.07  d ( range : 1.25  d/7.50  d ) and the programmed ablation depth was 117.2  32.2  m ( 36160 ) .
check - ups were scheduled for 1 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery . at each check - up changes in the posterior corneal curvature ( pcc ) , posterior corneal elevation ( pce ) , with respect to the best - fit sphere , and the anterior chamber depth as evaluated from the endothelium ( acd ) were studied by comparing the results of the preoperative evaluation with postoperative data .
