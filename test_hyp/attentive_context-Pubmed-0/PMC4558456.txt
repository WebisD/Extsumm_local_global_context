the objective of the present study is to describe the change in motor and nonmotor symptoms assessed by the mds - updrs and the nonmotor symptoms scale ( nmss ) in a real - life cohort of subjects with pd after a 21-month follow - up .
levodopa equivalent daily dose ( ledd ) was also calculated . the spanish version of mds - updrs , the parkinson disease quality of life questionnaire ( pdq-8 ) , and the nmss were applied to all subjects at two different cut - points ( initial evaluation and a follow - up visit at 21  3 months ) .
nonmotor progression has been less studied . a study derived from the adagio study population demonstrated an increase of 10% in the movement disorder society unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( mds - updrs ) part i score , which evaluates nonmotor experiences of daily living ( nm - edl ) , in the placebo group through a nine - month follow - up .
pd is a progressive neurodegenerative disease . rates of change in motor and nonmotor symptoms appear to progress differently in a nonlinear fashion with a greater increase in the m - edl in comparison to the nm - edl .
