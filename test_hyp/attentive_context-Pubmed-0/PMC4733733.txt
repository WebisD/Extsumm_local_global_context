, we aimed to determine the cellular origin of tes expression in aorta and examine whether its expression is affected in the aortic tissue during the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
in this study , we characterized the expression change of tes / testin in aortic tissues during hfd induced atherosclerosis using a well - established rabbit model .
/ testin was expressed in endothelium , and was down - regulated in atherosclerotic tissues , which suggested a possible role for testin in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ; however , the underlying mechanism is not clear and needs to be further investigated .
the rabbits were randomly divided into two groups as the following : ( 1 ) the normal diet ( nd ) group ( n = 12 ) were fed on 100 g / d of nd ; ( 2 ) high fat diet ( hfd ) group ( n = 20 ) were fed on the mixture of 100 g / d of 1% cholesterol , 5% lard , 10% egg yolk powder and 84% nd .
recently , it has been reported that the expression of tes was decreased in the left anterior descending aortic tissue from patients with coronary artery disease ( cad ) compared with non - cad subjects . in this report
