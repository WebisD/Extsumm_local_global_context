following this theory , the resection of ill - defined neoplastic lesions such as in situ lesions , lobular invasive , and multifocal invasive carcinomas should be firstly planned in preoperative phase , with an accurate definition of the lesion 's profile and with a careful evaluation of radiograms and other instrumental data ( ultrasound , mr ) , integrated with cytological and microhistological presurgical sampling . on the other hand , the higher efficacy of the delayed re - excisions points out
that the examination of the specimen with definitive histology is a more suitable procedure for establishing the morphological and biological characteristics of the lesion excised with the first excision and for planning further re - excisions .
, we planned to weigh up some of the issues that could be related with the occurrence of tumoral residuals , as the invasive or preinvasive nature of the lesion , the method of evaluation of the first resection adequacy , and the time occurring between the first resection and the re - excision .
, we evaluated the rate of residual lesions in re - excisions in the two groups of patients with final diagnosis of invasive carcinoma ( 13/28 ) and with final diagnosis of in situ carcinomas ( 6/17 ) .
