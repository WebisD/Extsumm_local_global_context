the present case report describes endoscopic access to the papilla with both push enteroscopy and double - balloon enteroscopy ( dbe , push - and - pull enteroscopy ) in a female patient after billroth ii resection with bile leakage following cholecystectomy .
endoscopic treatment of advanced biliary disorders and their complications following surgical procedures is often difficult especially after billroth ii gastric resection . in such cases , endoscopic access to the papilla and neopapilla
successful closure of the bile duct fistula could be achieved via an unusual abdominal - biliary - jejunal cannulation way after several attempts of modern enteroscopy and in this way re - operation was avoided .
thus , percutaneous cholangiodrainage or re - operation is therefore indicated when endoscopic access to the papilla failed . but both of those methods are much more invasive and more likely to be followed by complications than use of a purely endoscopic approach .
modern enteroscopy by experienced investigators using push - and - pull enteroscopes can provide access to the papilla even in complex postoperative anatomic rearrangements .
push - and - pull enteroscopes offer a further option for successful cannulation of the papilla and therapeutic interventions via additional stabilization with balloons and the modern enteroscopic approach by push - and - pull enteroscopy appears to provide more patient comfort , requires less analgo - sedation and examination time and in cases with intra - abdominal drainage this external access may be used as an additional aid for exploration and intervention in complex individual cases with extremely difficult treatable bile duct injuries .
