despite expanded indications for conservative surgery of urothelial tumors ( ut - formerly transitional cell carcinoma ) of the upper urinary tract ( uut ) , radical nephroureterectomy ( nue ) with complete removal of the distal ureter including the bladder cuff is the standard surgical technique used for most patients with ut of the uut .
another disadvantage is failure in applying the hem - o - lok clip , in which the technique is concluded without closing the ureter , and is generally thought to carry a higher risk of extravesical tumor recurrence , but as described recently , this technique has comparable oncological results to the open distal ureterectomy   .
clnue- ivlc is a relatively simple , reproducible , and minimally invasive method with minimal risks of tumor spillage and seeding .
the main disadvantage seems to be the risk of an unclosed defect of the urinary bladder , but based on our own experience , as reported in this paper and the available literature , we have not found any significant complications emerging from this .
failures in clip application were experienced only in early cases and , with increasing experience , this problem was avoided .
