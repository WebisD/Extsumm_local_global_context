auditory neuropathy / dyssynchrony ( an / ad ) is a hearing disorder characterized by an absent or atypical auditory brainstem response ( abr ) , with preservation of the cochlear microphonics ( cm ) and/or otoacoustic emissions ( oaes).1 
 2 in 1996 , starr et al first described this rare entity , drawing on their observations in 10 patients.3 the authors suggested that these patients were probably similar to those previously reported cases with a paradoxical absence of abrs and only a slight impairment of pure tone thresholds but in whom cms or oaes had not been recorded.3

 5 also in 1998 , doyle et al reported eight patients with normal transient evoked oaes ( teoaes ) and distortion product oaes ( dpoaes ) combined with the absence or marked abnormalities of abrs.6 starr et al suggested that this type of hearing impairment is due to a disorder that impairs auditory nerve function and may have as one of its causes a neuropathy of the auditory nerve , occurring either in isolation or as part of a systemic neuropathic process.3 clinically , the diagnostic criteria of an / ad is defined as ( 1 ) sensorineural hearing loss , usually bilateral , of any degree ; ( 2 ) normal outer hair cell function as evidenced by the presence of oaes and/or cm ; ( 3 ) absent or atypical abr ; ( 4 ) understanding of speech worse than would be predicted from the behavioral or pure tone audiometry ; ( 5 ) absent acoustic reflexes to the ipsilateral and contralateral tones a 110-db hearing level.1

  in this retrospective study , we investigated the audiological findings , history , and clinical manifestations of patients diagnosed with an / ad at our clinic .
