we assessed whether low to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with risk of t2 dm both overall and separately in low- , middle- and high - bmi individuals in a cross - sectional study of middle - aged new zealand men and women .
after further adjusting for total cholesterol , hdl - cholesterol , triglycerides , smoking habit , physical activity , socioeconomic status , body mass index , and hypertension , the relative risks of t2 dm were 0.16 ( 0.05 , 0.50 ) in normal weight individuals , 0.43 ( 0.19 , 0.97 ) in overweight individuals , and 0.92 ( 0.52 , 1.60 ) in overweight individuals .
study reported a u - shaped association between alcohol consumption and risk of t2 dm in women with a body mass index ( bmi ) < 25  kg / m   but an inverse association in the overweight and the obese .
after adjusting for age , gender , and ethnicity , the relative risk for t2 dm overall was 0.53 ( 95% ci : 0.34 , 0.82 ) in those drinking more than zero to < 5  g / day , and 0.60 ( 0.37 , 0.96 ) after also adjusting for current smoking habit , body mass index , total cholesterol , hdl - cholesterol , triglycerides , physical activity , socioeconomic status , and hypertension ( referred to hereafter as all potential confounders ) .   figure 1 shows the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for normal , overweight , and obese adults and overall , by alcohol consumption group .
