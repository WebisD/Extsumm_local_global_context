the  mismatched nutrition postnatal environment  represented by a western dietary pattern and improved economic status further increased susceptibility to hyperglycemia in those who experienced fetal exposure to famine . together with previous studies
, we found that exposure to severe famine in fetal life increased the risk of hyperglycemia in adulthood .
concentrations of fasting plasma glucose and prevalence rates of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes by birth cohort and severity of the chinese famine area * data are adjusted means ( se ) for fasting plasma glucose , sex standard prevalence , and odds ratio for hyperglycemia and diabetes .
however , the risks of hyperglycemia were largely comparable in these two groups ; the odds ratio of hyperglycemia in the fetal - exposed cohort was 3.71 ( 95% ci : 1.1312.2 , p = 0.031 ) in overweight subjects and 4.37 ( 95% ci : 1.1516.5 , p = 0.030 ) in normal weight subjects , respectively , compared with the nonexposed cohort .
in this study of a large sample of chinese adults , we found a significant association between severe famine exposure during the fetal period and an increased risk of hyperglycemia in adulthood .
2 , right column , graphs b1 , b2 , and b3 ) , but did not show consistent associations . when we defined the severely affected famine areas as those with an excess death rate 100% , the prevalence of hyperglycemia among the fetal - exposed cohort in severely affected famine areas increased to 8.1% , but this did not change the associations between fetal exposure to famine and risk of hyperglycemia in adulthood .
