such an approach 
 has previously been used to visualize connections between concepts 
 in the scientific literature and to identify logical gaps in study .
the capability of decision - makers to evaluate the 
 total impacts 
 of biofuels , including their environmental and economic trade - offs , 
 and the accuracy of those evaluations depend on the availability of 
 robust data and analyses . here ,
we ask : does the published , peer - reviewed 
 literature present a full portrait of biofuels and their potential 
 impacts and trade - offs ?
we also examined geographic trends . 
 finally , we examined the frequency of interdisciplinary research as 
 an index of our understanding of the complex interactions and feedbacks 
 possible under global biofuel production scenarios .
our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity 
 in the amount of 
 research on the numerous critical topics relevant to an industry with 
 as wide - reaching effects as biofuels .
rather , our primary goal was to ascertain the structure 
 of biofuels research efforts in the past decade in order to stimulate 
 discussion of its utility to a range of stakeholders .
we first defined three major areas of research ( termed  themes  
 hereafter ) : environment and human well - being ( eh ) , economics ( ec ) , 
 and production - distribution technology and infrastructure ( pti ) .
