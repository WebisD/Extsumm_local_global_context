, we analyzed the 5-year follow - up data from a prospective randomized investigational device exemption ( ide ) clinical trial to evaluate the following : the incidence of cervicogenic headache in patients suffering from myelopathy or radiculopathy who undergo surgery , the temporal change in headache score after surgery , and the difference , if any , between one- and two - level cda and arthrodesis .
a prospective , randomized , controlled multicenter study of two - level anterior cervical disk surgery conducted by davis et al reported improved neck disability index ( ndi ) and visual analog scale ( vas ) neck pain scores for arthroplasty compared with fusion at 2 years.17 if headache relief is facilitated by improved cervical kinematics after arthroplasty , patients undergoing two - level arthroplasty may experience even greater headache relief than patients undergoing two - level fusion surgery . in this study
the ihs proposed diagnostic criteria for cervicogenic headache that include pain referred from the neck and involving the head and/or face , clinical or radiographic evidence that suggests a cervical spine lesion , elimination of the headache after diagnostic blockade , and pain resolution 3 months after treatment.3 for the diagnostic blockade , pain anesthesiologists target the c1c2 joint , the c2c3 joint , and c3c4 joint to provide possible relief and objective evidence of a cervical source of the headache.6 
 7 various mechanisms to explain cervicogenic headache have been proposed , including the role of spinal kinematics.3 although cervicogenic headache was previously thought to be associated with upper cervical spine pathology ( c1c3 ) , the treatment of lower surgical pathology results in headache relief.8

 11 recent work by schrot et al has illustrated not that only was lower cervical disk disease an apparent headache generator , but also that differences in headache relief after upper- or lower - level subaxial surgery was not observed.9 
  cervical total disk replacement in comparison with fusion has equivalent or better outcomes.12 
 13 in addition , the recent long - term data demonstrates that cervical disk arthroplasty ( cda ) not only preserves motion at the index level but also reduces adjacent - segment disease compared with fusion procedures.7

 16 although riina et al found that patients undergoing single - level arthroplasty had greater headache relief in comparison with patients undergoing arthrodesis , our group did not find a significant difference between the two groups using a similar data set for single - level surgeries.8 
 9 comparing the data from a two - level arthroplasty versus fusion may better resolve this difference if improved cervical spine biomechanics contributes to headache relief .
