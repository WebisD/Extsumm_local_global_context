our findings suggest that the presence of mucus in urine can be used as an alternative laboratory test in cm in children below 12 years old and even in infants ( 24 months old ) .
we aimed to probe into the association between the presence of mucus in urine and cm in otherwise healthy children and evaluate its value as a diagnostic test .
mucus in urine ( microscopic finding ) was positive in 357 ( 99.44% ) of the 359 children in group a , while only 22 ( 8.3% ) of the 264 children in group b were mucus positive in urine analysis .
eeg was found to be abnormal ( pike slow , 2 - 3 htz and multi - spike pattern = abnormal eeg ) in 201 of the 359 children ( 55.98% ) in group a and in 131 of the 264 children ( 49.62% ) in group b. no significant correlation was seen between abnormal eeg and masturbatory behaviors ( p=0.32 ) .
