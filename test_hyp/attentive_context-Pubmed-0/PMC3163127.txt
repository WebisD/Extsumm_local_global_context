in which we examine women with an before and after weight normalization and compare them with healthy female control subjects , we propose that a substantial amount of the unexplained increase in ree during refeeding of an patients is channeled towards bmd recovery such that significant bone rebuilding is required before energy stores become available for restoration of gonadal function .
nonetheless , our hypothesis that bone recovery utilizes a vast amount of energy offers the exciting possibility that prolonged nutritional rehabilitation may lead to recovery from osteopenia and osteoporosis and resumption of menses in the women who remain amenorrheic with low bmd .
osteocalcin and n - telopeptide ( ntx ) , established biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption , respectively , have been shown to appropriately increase and decrease , respectively , with weight recovery   accompanied with a 3 - 4% increase in bmd in as little as 4 months . in this longitudinal study
the ree correlations with spine and leg bmds were even more significant after controlling for weight gain , an important predictor of bmd ( r = 0.65 , p < 0.005 ) and ( r = 0.56 , p < 0.02 ) , respectively .
