the objective of this study is to quantitatively estimate the effect of medicare supplementation on use of health services by medicare beneficiaries .
the empirical specification for the model is : where the subscript i denotes the ith medicare beneficiary ; ui measures the person 's annual use of health services ( two alternative models are estimated : one for annual number of physician visits and one for annual number of hospital days ) ; privi is a binary variable indicating whether the ith beneficiary supplements medicare with some type of private health insurance ; caidi is a binary variable indicating whether the ith beneficiary received medicaid benefits during the past 12 months ; x3i through xni compose a set of variables to control for other factors influencing the ith person 's utilization ; and ei is a stochastic error term , assumed to have a truncated - normal distribution .
thus , results from the analysis of physician utilization are reported separately for ( 1 ) elderly medicare beneficiaries who have no chronic health problems and ( 2 ) those who have one or more such conditions . in contrast
table 1 reports the average utilization of health services among medicare beneficiaries by type of supplementation , both in absolute terms and relative to the average utilization by medicare beneficiaries who do not supplement ( shown in parentheses in the table ) .
