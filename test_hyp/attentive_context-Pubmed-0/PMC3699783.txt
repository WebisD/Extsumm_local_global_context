as such , both erp44 activity and its shuttling between the er and cisgolgi are ph regulated to drive a quality control cycle dedicated to the surveillance of secretory protein assembly .
the erp44 assembly control cycle thus embodies the last - resort quality control mechanism to prevent the untimely exit from the early secretory compartment of orphan subunits of otherwise disulfide - linked oligomeric secretory proteins .
our results suggest a model in which the simultaneous unmasking of the client and kdel - r binding interfaces is facilitated by dislocation of the erp44 c - terminal tail ( c - tail ) , which in turn likely involves protonation state of the active site cysteine ( c29 ) at cisgolgi - equivalent ph .
it is yet unclear how erp44 cycles between its predominant localizations in the distal early secretory pathway and the er , and how such cycling would relate to thiol - mediated retention .
protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) is monitored by stringent quality control mechanisms that prevent release of immature or misfolded er client proteins to travel further along the secretory pathway .
the ph gradient between er and golgi may serve multiple roles  in the cell , such as calibrating activity of lectins and golgi glycan - modifying enzymes ( paroutis et  al . , 2004 ) . we have shown here that the ph gradient is exploited also for regulating quality control and secretion of a selection of key proteins .
