a computer - aided optimization technique using 2 ( three - factor and two - level ) factorial design was employed to investigate the effect of the amounts of various hydrophilic polymers , namely , calcium alginate , hpmc k4 m , and carbopol 943 in polymer - blend used as three independent process variables ( factors ) , on the properties of bisoprolol fumarate sustained release matrix tablets like drug release and hardness .
these developed optimized matrix tablets showed prolonged sustained release of bisoprolol fumarate over 12 hours , which might be beneficial over the conventional tablet to reduce the dosing frequency with improved patient compliance .
the amounts of calcium alginate , hpmc k4 m , and carbopol 943 in bisoprolol fumarate matrix tablets on the properties of bisoprolol fumarate sustained release matrix tablet like drug release and hardness were analyzed and optimized .
the objective of the current investigation was to develop bisoprolol fumarate sustained release matrix tablet containing a hydrophilic polymer - blend of calcium alginate , hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( hpmc k4 m ) , and carbopol 943 by direct compression method using response surface methodology .
bisoprolol fumarate matrix tablets for sustained release application were successfully developed by response surface methodology based on 2 factorial design .
