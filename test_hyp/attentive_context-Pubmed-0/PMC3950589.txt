the present study has reinforced the findings of other reports   that in order to improve the sustainability of informal care of people with dementia in the community the formal community care system needs to take a more proactive approach in engaging with informal carers . in order to reduce the burden of care on the primary carers of people with dementia
there is increasing recognition within australian aged care funding and policy that the care and support of people with dementia is complex and needs to take the particular needs of carers into consideration .
this method was chosen as was congruent with the research aims , allowed for an in - depth understanding of the informal caring experience of family carers of people with dementia , and enabled the experience of carers to be presented from their own point of view .
the issues which emerged through the present study , combined with other recent research in australia , suggests that for informal dementia care to become more sustainable it is necessary to ensure that formal service provision is flexible enough to respond to the complexity of the circumstances ( family , social , and economic ) , not only for the person with dementia but also for their informal carer / s .
