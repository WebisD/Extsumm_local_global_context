a 52-year - old female patient visited the hospital complaining of pain in both breasts .
pain after breast surgery , which is commonly complaint by patients , is known to be related with the injury , ischemia and inflammation of the soft tissue .
, we report a case in which prf was applied to control the pain of a patient who came to the hospital complaining of chronic severe neuropathic pain at the operation site that arose after breast reduction surgery .
the patient in this case study was also a chronic neuropathic pain patient whose pain had continued for 3 years following breast reduction surgery .
in addition , prf may be helpful in reducing the pain of the patients who are not responsive to a nerve block using analgesics or local anesthetics .
furthermore , additional studies are needed regarding the reduction of chronic neuropathic pain by prf after breast surgery .
if the pain in the affected part and arm continues for one year after the surgery , it is considered as chronic pain in general .
if an appropriate pain treatment had been given after breast surgery to the patient in this case report , she would have not suffered from chronic pain . in the case of breast surgery , considerable attention should be paid to postoperative pain as well as surgical pain , and pain treatment should be carried out positively .
