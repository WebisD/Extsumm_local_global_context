a retrospective design was used to obtain data on patients designated as alc in two hospitals .
costa and hirdes reported that non - alzheimer s dementia accounted for just over 30% of their alc sample , and those with alzheimer s disease comprised 10% of their sample . because little is known about the alc population that continues to wait in hospital , the purpose of this study was to systematically identify select social and health characteristics of hospitalized patients who were designated as alc .
the high rates of dementia seen in this study suggest the issue of alc is closely connected to a diagnosis of dementia .
of these , 57 were in the specialized geriatric hospital ( 104 beds ) occupying 54.8% of the beds , and 124 patients were in acute care beds in the tertiary care hospital ( 444 beds ) , occupying 27.9% of these hospital beds .
there were 116 ( 64.8% ) females in the sample , and the average age of all patients was 79.3 ( sd 12.7 ) years .
when the sample was stratified into three groups ( diagnosis of dementia prior to admission , diagnosis of dementia during hospitalization , and no dementia ) , there was a significant difference in the mean ages ( p  .0001 ) and the average number of medications taken ( p = .003 ) among the three groups ( table 3 ) . within the total sample ,
