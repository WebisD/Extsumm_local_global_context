the rate of stillbirths was higher with moderate / severe anemia and with erythrocytosis ( p < 0.05 ) , which remained higher after controlling for confounders ( table 3 ) .
the rate of preeclampsia was significantly higher in moderate / severe and mild anemia and in mothers with erythrocytosis , which remained after controlling for confounders ( table 6 ) .
the rate of preterm births was increased in women with severe anemia ( 9.01% ; or = 1.81 ) . after adjusting for confounders , moderate / severe anemia ( or = 1.73 ) and mild anemia ( or = 1.28 ) were risks for preterm deliveries ( table 4 ) .
an increased risk for moderate / severe anemia was associated with higher gestational age at second measurement of hemoglobin , bmi < 19.9  kg / m , living without partner , prenatal visits care < 5 , first parity , multiparity , and preeclampsia .
in addition , risk factors for moderate / severe anemia will be assessed in a multivariable analysis .
the results of this study confirm that prevalence of anemia increases as pregnancy progresses and that a normal value at first booking should not be considered sufficient , as further hb values should be indicated and observed during the course of pregnancy .
