the present study aimed to examine the relationship between pa : a and eid and develop a simple screening tool by determining the appropriate cutoff score on the 6mwt to predict a pa : a > 1 in patients with copd .
spo2 < 90% , spo2 88% , and spo2 4% during 6mwt were 94.3 ( 80.899.3 ) , 97.1 ( 85.199.9 ) , and 45.7 ( 28.863.4 ) , respectively , for specificity , 93.1 ( 77.299.2 ) , 95.8 ( 78.999.9 ) , and 59.6 ( 44.373.6 ) , respectively , for positive predictive value , and 16.2 ( 4.262.8 ) , 27.7 ( 4193.3 ) , and 1.8 ( 1.32.4 ) , respectively , for positive likelihood ratios .
using roc curves , the threshold values with the best cutoff point , sensitivity , and specificity to predict pa : a > 1 were determined for spo2 during the 6mwt ( best cutoff point 89% , area under curve [ auc ] 0.94 , 95% ci 0.881 ) , dlco ( best cutoff point 51% , auc 0.87 , 95% ci 0.780.96 ) , 6mwd ( best cutoff point 388 m , auc 0.75 , 95% ci 0.620.87 ) , and bode index ( best cutoff points 4 , auc 0.74 , 95% ci 0.610.87 ) ( table 3 , figure 3 ) .
