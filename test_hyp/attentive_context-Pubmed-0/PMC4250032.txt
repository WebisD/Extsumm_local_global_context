dermatology and cardiology at a first glance seem to be very distinct medical fields , but the relationship between them is shown by the adverse effects of amiodarone , the key antiarrhythmic drug .
amiodarone has been used by physicians for over 50 years to treat supraventricular and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias , and it often provides the last treatment option due to its high efficacy .
any doctor approached by a patient with skin lesions secondary to amiodarone must be aware of the risks of stopping treatment , because it can exacerbate the severity of arrhythmias and even lead to sudden cardiac death .
complications of chronic amiodarone therapy compel the prescribing physician to inform the patient about all possible adverse reactions , methods of avoiding them , and the need for specialist advice if symptoms occur .
although the dermatological complications usually do not influence the outcome of the therapy and rarely cause the discontinuation of treatment , they have great impact on patient quality of life .
the incidence in the population of patients with prolonged use of this drug reaches nearly 75% according to various sources .
however , prolonged amiodarone therapy unfortunately carries an extended risk of adverse effects , mainly involving the thyroid gland , liver , lungs , eyes , and skin .
