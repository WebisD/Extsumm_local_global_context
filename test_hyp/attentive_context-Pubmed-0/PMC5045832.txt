a patient with severe papulopustular rosacea ( ppr ) and severe background erythema responded well to a treatment regimen consisting of a short course of antibiotics in combination with a corticosteroid , followed by monotherapy with isotretinoin.in patients with very severe , inflamed disease , it is necessary to achieve a rapid response with a fast - acting combinatorial treatment regimen to reduce the inflammation.patients with severe ppr and an inflammatory component can respond rapidly when treated using a multimodal , tailored approach .
in patients with very severe , inflamed rosacea , a multimodal , tailored approach with a short course of macrolide antibiotics in combination with corticosteroids is needed to strongly address the inflammatory component upfront and improve patient outcomes ; corticosteroids are not strictly contraindicated in the treatment of rosacea if used for a short period to reduce inflammation showing signs of rosacea fulminans . in these patients , long - term therapy is needed to improve outcomes , with isotretinoin being effective in further reducing inflammatory lesions count and in maintaining remission .
the patient experienced a continuous reduction in the severity of her erythema , which was further improved with the use of brimonidine 3  mg / g .
