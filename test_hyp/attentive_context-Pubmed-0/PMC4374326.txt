therefore , the present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the de / remineralization potential of different child formula dentifrices on artificial carious lesions in primary teeth using a 7 days ph - cycling model .
based on the results obtained from the present study , we could conclude that the child formula dentifrices containing naf and sodium monofluorophosphate have the ability to remineralize the initial carious lesions in the primary teeth as both reduced the depth of the artificial carious lesions .
comparison of the depth of the lesion before and after ph cycling in group a ( cheerio gel ) , group b ( colgate paokeman ) and group c ( children 's natural ) inter group comparison revealed that , the mean and sd in groups a and b after ph cycling had decreased than the mean and sd before ph cycling . only mean and sd for group c had increased after ph cycling .
comparison of the depth of the lesion among the pretreatment groups a , b and c using anova on comparison , the posttreatment lesion depths of groups a , b and c showed mean and sd as 175  22 , 173  16 and 201  18 respectively , which was found to be statistically significant ( p = 0.012 ) as shown in table 3 .
