familial hemiplegic migraine ( fhm ) is an autosomal dominant rare type of migraine with aura characterized by some degree of hemiparesis .
we present a norwegian family with a v628  m mutation in the atp1a2 gene ( fig .  1 ) .
we conclude that nimodipine is contraindicated in the management of prolonged fhm attack , and recommend conservative management except from supplement of sufficient intravenous fluid in nauseated patients in order to avoid hypovolemia .
the majority of fhm families have pure fhm , but cerebellar ataxia is frequent in fhm families with mutation in the cacna1a gene   .
a 16-year - old male was referred to the neurological ward on a hot summer day due to a prolonged attack of fhm .
this caused additional hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the right hemisphere , which lead to a generalized tonic 
clonic seizure and a secondary edema as shown on mri and spect ( for details see above ) .
fhm1 , fhm2 and fhm3 are caused by mutations in the ion - channel genes cacna1a , atp1a2 and scn1a , respectively   .
mutations in the atp1a2 gene usually cause pure fhm , but alternating hemiplegia of childhood , benign familial infantile convulsions , cerebellar symptoms , severe episodic neurological deficits and mental retardation have also been reported   .
