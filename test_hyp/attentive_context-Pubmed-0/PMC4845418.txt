we analyzed 13 patients with established non unions of subtrochanteric fractures treated in our centre by the use of the pf - lcp .
clinical picture of the anatomical pf - lcp with proximal screws showing divergent screws and various angles ( 95 , 120 and 135 degrees )
here we have used a surgical grade 316 l stainless steel proximal femoral anatomical locked compression plate ( pf - lcp ) .
the average harris hip score at 1 year follow - up was excellent in eight , good in four and fair in one patient respectively .
the choice of implants used can be either a dynamic condylar screw plate ( dcs ) orproximal femoral nail ( pfn ) .
we conclude that in complicated non - unions , the use of pf - lcp has a definite positive role in the management of such cases .
all our patients were followed up by serial radiographs at 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 weeks and thereafter at 6 months interval .
union was achieved in 11 out of 13 patients at 12 weeks whereas two patients had delayed union which eventually healed at 18 weeks and 24 weeks .
