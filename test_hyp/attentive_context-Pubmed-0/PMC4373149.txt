the overall plasma observations show that cassini passed from the magnetosphere through field - aligned currents ( observed in the b component of the magnetic field ) and then the spacecraft entered open field lines where it observed cusp plasma .
this study focuses on the cusp observations , and therefore , we do not explore the facs further . while in the cusp , ims observed ion energy - latitude dispersions : the effect of magnetopause reconnection , poleward convection of open field lines , and possible azimuthal dispersion .
the angular distributions of the ions show that they are coming from below the spacecraft , which is consistent with convection of a newly opened magnetospheric field line .
a future statistical study of the cusp will help describe the debated nature and overall rate of reconnection at saturn . in order to describe saturn 's rotational effect on the cusp ,
