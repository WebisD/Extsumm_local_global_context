female genital tuberculosis ( fgtb ) is common in developing countries and associated with significant morbidity in the form of menstrual dysfunction , infertility , tubal block , peritubal adhesions , intrauterine adhesions , and perihepatic adhesions .
the new sign case is easily diagnosed by gynecologists during routine laparotomy performed for infertility patients with suspected fgtb and can aid in its diagnosis
a 25-year - old woman with family history of pulmonary tb was presented to the gynecology outpatient department with primary infertility and oligomenorrhea of 3 years . on examination ,
fallopian tubes are involved in about 90% of the cases with findings such as congested tubes , tubercles , or caseous nodules on them , peritubal adhesions , and tubal blockage at various levels such as cornual block , mid - tubal block , multiple tubal blocks , or fimbrial block , hydrosalpinx , pyosalpinx , and tubo - ovarian masses .
other authors have also found laparoscopy very useful in diagnosis and management of genital and peritoneal tb with the advantage of avoidance of laparoscopy which is more traumatic and hazardous especially in a case of abdominopelvic tb . in a case of fgtb ,
although gold standard in diagnosis of fgtb is demonstration of mycobacterium tuberculosis either on microscopy or culture of endometrial biopsy or presence of epithelioid granuloma on histopathology , they are positive in only few cases leading on to missing of diagnosis in many cases . polymerase chain reaction on endometrial biopsy is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting mycobacterium dna ( mpt 64 gene ) but can be false positive and may not be able to differentiate between infection and disease .
