these results indicate that underestimation of tree canopy and impervious cover was related to the amount of tree and impervious cover , with developed lands exhibiting the greatest underestimation of both tree canopy and impervious cover
however , the overall and variable underestimation of tree canopy cover by nlcd relative to photo - interpretation is important to understand because of the increasing use of nlcd products in environmental management and planning applications ( e.g. , use of nlcd canopy cover in evaluating habitat distribution and conservation ( martinuzzi and others 2009 ) or hydrologic modeling and monitoring using estimates of impervious surfaces ( journal of hydrologic engineering 2009 ) .
results reported here differ in that the analysis was not designed to be a pixel - by - pixel accuracy assessment , rather it was designed to test differences between nlcd - derived and photo - interpreted estimates of overall percentage tree canopy and impervious cover for each of the 65 mapping zones .
the analysis of all 65 mapping zones found an average difference of 1.4% , which is similar to the difference from the county analysis .
this assessment was conducted to provide a better understanding of the potential limitations of nlcd tree canopy and impervious cover estimates for each mapping zone .
