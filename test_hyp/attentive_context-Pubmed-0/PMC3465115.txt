also , this has been recently investigated as an agent that can enhance the efficacy of analgesic drugs.  some studies have also suggested a role of magnesium sulfate ( mgso4 ) as an adjuvant agent , an n - methyl - d - aspartate receptor antagonist , in the management of postoperative pain . the perioperative administration of iv mgso 4 is associated with smaller analgesic requirements , and magnesium sulfate could be of interest as an adjuvant to postoperative analgesia.  the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical stability of tramadol hcl combined with ketorolac tromethamine and metoclopramide hcl in solution for 48 h ( 25c ) and 5 days ( 5c ) , with the presence of mgso4 .
in this study , precise and accurate hplc method suitable for stability evaluation of tramadol hcl combined with ketorolac tromethamine and metoclopramide hcl is described .
the physical appearance of the solutions remained constant during the study period , without the formation of any visible discoloration , cloudiness , or precipitation . in admixtures containing mgso4 and stored at 25c , each drug , at the same time , reached at least 98% of the initial concentration during 48 h. solutions prepared adding mgso4 assessed over a period of 5 days at 5c show the lower confidence limit of the estimated regression line of the concentration at 98% of the initial concentration . within these limits , for the purpose of pre - preparing drug admixtures to use with confidence , tramadol hcl infusions may be prepared in advance and then thawed before use in clinical units .
