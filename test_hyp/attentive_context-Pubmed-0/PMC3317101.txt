the aim of the present study was to evaluate our 10-year experience in employing a rapid intraoperative pth assay for php .
we also had 3 cases of double adenoma in which the iopth resulted in a tn value , requiring additional exploration to prevent persistent disease ( table 2 ) .
the demographic , clinical , and biochemical aspects of 91 patients with php are shown in table 1 . among all cohort of 91 patients , 69 ( 75.8% ) had solitary adenoma , 10 ( 11.0% ) had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men1 ) , 6 ( 6.6% ) had double adenomas , 4 ( 4.4% ) had carcinomas , and 2 ( 2.2% ) patients are still waiting for remedial surgery for multiglandular disease ( mgd ) , 1 of whom had recurrence disease after 10 years of follow - up and the other persistent disease after a false positive iopth ( table 2 ) .
the mean decay of iopth in the 80 patients with tp results was 81.7% , with a minimum drop of 55.0% ( 55.0% to 96.0% ) .
, we had 80 tp results ( 67 adenomas , 3 carcinomas , 8 men1 and 2 recurrences
