several techniques , such as the bangham , detergent - depletion , ether / ethanol injection , reverse phase evaporation , and emulsion methods , have been reported for preparing liposomes with high - entrapment efficiency , narrow particle size distribution , and long - term stability.17 recently , some alternative methods including dense gas and supercritical fluid techniques have been introduced for liposome preparation without using any organic solvent.1,79 due to the differences in preparation methods and lipid compositions , liposomes can be classified according to their lamellarity ( uni- and multilamellar vesicles ) , size ( small [ 100 nm ] , intermediate [ 100250 nm ] , or large [ 250 nm ] ) , and surface charge ( anionic , cationic , or neutral).1012 in clinical studies , liposomes show improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of therapeutic agents and thus minimize toxicity by their accumulation at the target tissue.13,14 liposomes were first discovered by bangham in 1965 and the first liposomal pharmaceutical product , doxil , ( ben venue laboratories , inc bedford , oh ) received us food and drug administration ( fda ) approval in 1995 for the treatment of chemotherapy refractory acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids)-related kaposi s sarcoma.1315 currently , there are about twelve liposome - based drugs approved for clinical use and more are in various stages of clinical trials ( tables 1 and 2).1362 most liposomal drug formulations , such as doxil and myocet ( gp - pharm , barcelona , spain ) , are approved for intravenous application.63 other administration routes such as intramuscular delivery have been approved for delivery of surface antigens derived from the hepatitis a or influenza virus ( epaxal [ berna biotech ltd , berne switzerland ] and inflexal v [ berna biotech espaa sa , madrid , spain]).37,38 oral delivery has also been examined ; however , this is more troublesome due to the potential for liposome breakdown following exposure to bile salts.64
