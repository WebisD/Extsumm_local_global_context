we present our experience with the use of large pore polypropylene mesh / polypropylene - polyglactin mesh as a pubovaginal sling ( midurethral ) in the treatment of sui with the modified raz technique .
polypropylene mesh as midurethral slings by modified raz technique is cost - effective , safe , and has acceptable complication rates .
forty - five ( 85% ) patients were completely dry and eight ( 15% ) were socially dry at the end of the follow - up .
a retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive 53 patients of pure sui who underwent midurethral slings procedure with the modified technique from june 2003 to december 2008 at our institute .
none of the patients reported significant voiding dysfunction , infection , nonhealing , or erosion of the sling till their last follow - up [ table 2 ] .
four patients failed voiding trial and were advised cic , which was later discontinued after 38 weeks , when their pvr fell to < 50 ml .
mean duration of follow - up was 46.1 months ( 1278 months ) [ table 1 ] .
five of our patients complained of mild dyspareunia , which was transient and did not require treatment [ table 2 ] .
