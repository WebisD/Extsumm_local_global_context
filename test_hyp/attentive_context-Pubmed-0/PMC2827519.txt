then targeting interventions to those groups most at risk will help address the public health burden of type 1 diabetes and its complications in minority populations . in summary , insulin resistance as estimated by egdr was greater in minorities with type 1 diabetes than in nhw probands . because there exists a strong association between insulin resistance and poor health outcomes in diabetes , the search for effective interventions to improve insulin resistance in minorities with type 1 diabetes must become a priority .
variables entered into the model : current age , race / ethnicity , head of household education , percent body fat , parental obesity , parental insulin resistance , hdl , triglycerides , albumin - to - creatinine ratio , acanthosis , elevated c - reactive protein , positive cotinine , sleep duration , and shbg . whether the racial / ethnic variation in egdr was driven by differences in the components used to calculate egdr was explored . with adjustment for age , compared with nhw participants , nonwhites had significantly higher a1c and a trend for larger waist circumference ( 9.7 vs. 7.9% , p = 0.0005 , and 72.2 vs. 68.2 cm , p = 0.10 , respectively ; estimates at mean age of 13.5 years ) , and a trend toward a higher prevalence of hypertension ( 26.4 vs. 11.5% , odds ratio 3.1 , p = 0.10 ) .
