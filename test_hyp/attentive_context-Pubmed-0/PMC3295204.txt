the biological 
 data obtained both on target with time - resolved fluorescence resonance 
 energy transfer ( tr - fret)/fluorescence polarization ( fp ) assays and 
 in cellular pca models demonstrate the non - lbp antagonist activity 
 of the series and an alternative mechanism of inhibition , furnishing 
 a new class of nonpeptidic , small molecule ar : coactivator selective 
 disruptors as leads for the development of novel treatments for prostate 
 cancer .
mechanistically , 
 these compounds are totally differentiated from the recent description 
 of true lbp antiandrogens like mdv3100 and rd162 , while their selectivity and druglike nature underpin the potential 
 of a non - lbp intervention strategy in advanced prostate cancer resistant 
 to  classical therapy 
we describe the discovery and characterization of a novel 
 class of selective non - lbp  true 
we report the discovery , identification , and characterization of a 
 novel series of diarylhydrazide non - lbp - binding antiandrogen compounds , 
 with demonstrated ability to displace ar coactivators and with established 
 potency in ar - dependent prostate cancer cell lines .
this result supports the hypothesis of a nonclassical mechanism 
 of ar inhibition for these diarylhydrazide ligands and it also demonstrates 
 the potential application of these and other non - lbp antiandrogen 
 small molecules targeting alternative ar sites in combination with 
 existing prostate cancer therapy .
