we describe the case of a patient with rbd in whom endoscopic and histopathologic findings were observed chronologically , along with a review of the relevant literature .
this was a valuable case in which the clinical and pathological features of rbd , an extremely rare disease , could be compared in the present patient from onset to healing .
russell body duodenitis ( rbd ) is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by an abundance of polyclonal plasma cells present in the duodenal mucosa .
he was found to have a nodule in the right middle lung field on a plain chest radiograph at a local clinic , and was referred to our hospital for detailed examination .
multiple endoscopic observations and biopsies , like that used in the present case , are required to diagnose malignant disease .
the patient was negative for h. pylori and hiv , and there was no evidence of malignancy or immunodeficiency .
a nodule measuring 2 cm was detected in segment 8 of the right lung on chest plain computed tomography ( ct ) .
the differential diagnoses include plasmacytoma , mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma , and signet ring cell carcinoma . in the present case , because the russell bodies were derived from plasma cells positive for cd79a and were suggested to be polyclonal by the mixture of  and  chain - positive cells , rbd was diagnosed .
