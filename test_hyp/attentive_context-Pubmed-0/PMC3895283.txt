similar to normal breast tissue , both epithelial and myoepithelial cells are present and the glands are subject to both the dysplastic and malignant changes that are seen in normal breast tissue ( van der putte , 1994 ) . we report a case of a mammary - like invasive carcinoma presenting as an asymptomatic vulvar nodule .
we demonstrate this to be a potentially feasible technique for primary breast adenocarcinomas arising within the vulva in mammary - like glands , and in the context of such a rare histology , may be included in the management options of this disease .
 ectopic breast tissue  in the vulva was first described by hartung in 1872 , and since that time , several cases of both benign and malignant lesions arising in vulvar mammary tissue have been reported ( van der putte , 1994 ) .
a 65  year old , multiparous , postmenopausal female status - post total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy 39  years prior for symptomatic myomatous uterus , presented for her annual well woman exam .
a relative paucity of reports has documented complications of ectopic breast tissue in the vulva , beginning with hartung in 1872 .
