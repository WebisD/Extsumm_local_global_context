this study was designed to study the role of cord blood plasma renin activity ( pra ) and ultrasonography in antenatal diagnosis and prognostication in puv .
the difference in mean cord blood pra values between the controls and non - puv group ( p = 0.004 ) , puv and control groups ( p < 0.0001 ) , and puv and non - puv groups ( p <
on antenatal ultrasound keyhole sign , bladder cycling , oligoamnios , and cortical cysts are not consistent findings in posterior urethral valves . in congenital hydronephrosis cord
blood pra is significantly higher in cases with puv than those without puv and falls significantly after valve ablation .
cord blood pra was raised in 2/3 of the patients with pujo and none of the patients with non - obstructive hydronephrosis . also , the levels were significantly higher in cases of puv than those without puv ( p < 0.0001 ) .
amniotic fluid index on initial ultrasound ( n = 25 ) the mean cord blood pra value for controls and patients were 3.95  1.57 ng / ml / hr ( range : 2.26 - 8.00
correlation between glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) and plasma renin activity ( pra ) in posterior urethral valve ( puv ) patients ( n = 10 ) gestational age at detection of hydronephrosis , bladder wall thickness , amnitotic fluid index , and presence of cortical cysts did not significantly correlate with renal impairment among puv patients .
