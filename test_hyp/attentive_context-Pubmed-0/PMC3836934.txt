the surgical decompression of mechanical va compressions constitutes an appropriate treatment with a good prognosis .
, we were able to achieve successful decompression of the va ; the two patients recovered completely without further clinical symptoms .
a 50-year - old woman had been experiencing paroxysmal vertigo attacks for a 10 month period prior to visiting our institute .
bow hunter 's syndrome ( bhs ) is caused by the compression of the dominant vertebral artery ( va ) against a fibrous band or osseous prominence by rotational head movement2,6,10 ) , leading to ischemic insult in the vertebrobasilar territory8,14 ) .
recently , we encountered 2 cases , which we present herein along with our surgical approach . in these 2 cases
bhs presents as recurrent attacks of paroxysmal vertigo , nystagmus , and ataxia caused by head rotation5,8,10 ) . due to the rarity of this pathology
as mentioned above , there is no definitive guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of bhs because of its rarity .
we selected a surgical approach and found an adhesion between the left va and transverse foramen .
after surgery , the patient 's symptoms improved , and her neck three - dimensional angiography ct scans demonstrated complete decompression of the right vertebral artery ( fig . 3 , 4 ) .
