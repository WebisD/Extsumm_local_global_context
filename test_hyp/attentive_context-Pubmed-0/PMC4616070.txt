the purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between basic physical 
 fitness and pulmonary function in healthy korean school students to enable us to present an 
 alternative method for improving their pulmonary function .
aerobic exercise and exercise programs to increase muscle strength and power are needed , and 
 they would be especially effective if they were to begin in the late period of elementary 
 school when the muscle strength and power of students are rapidly increasing .
the participants were divided into the early period of elementary 
 school ( 68 y ) , the late period of elementary school ( 911 y ) , the period of middle school 
 ( 1214 y ) , and the period of high school ( 1517 y ) in order to investigate the rapid changes
