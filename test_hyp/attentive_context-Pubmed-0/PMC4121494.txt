re - administration of rocuronium within a short time interval after sugammadex may result in unpredictable effects of the nmb agent .
it has been shown previously that the reversal of nmb with anticholinesterase drugs may not be complete after a large dose of a neuromuscular blocking agent .
sugammadex resolved the residual nmb within 2 min , even after reversal with anticholinesterase agents , and is a safe alternative to reversal of nmb induced by steroidal non - depolarizing agents . in this case , deep rocuronium - induced nmb can be reversed successfully with sugammadex at doses of 2 mg / kg and in as little as 2 min .
a 21-year - old man ( height = 180 cm , weight = 95 kg , body mass index = 29.3 kg / m ) presented to the outpatient department with a long history of frequent and severe snoring . on physical exam ,
sugammadex made it possible to perform a rapid , complete reverse when the residual block was maintained by an incomplete reversal of anticholinesterase .
the endovascular embolization due to refractory bleeding after tonsillectomy proved to be a valuable treatment method as an effective alternative to surgical intervention .
