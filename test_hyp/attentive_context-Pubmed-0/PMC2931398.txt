thus , the purpose of the present study was to determine whether performing a single exercise bout impacts daily paee in postmenopausal women and to determine whether the intensity of the exercise bout plays a role in any potential changes in daily paee .
therefore , there was a reduction in paee outside of the center - based exercise sessions in both intervention groups , and this reduction appeared to differ based on the intensity level of the center - based exercise because it was greater in women performing vigorous - intensity , compared to moderate - intensity , exercise .
paee on days with center - based exercise was significantly higher in women performing moderate - intensity exercise than in women performing vigorous - intensity exercise ( p = .052 ) .  
data used for the current analyses are from women who were randomized to caloric restriction plus moderate - intensity aerobic exercise ( moderate - intensity ) or caloric restriction plus vigorous - intensity aerobic exercise ( vigorous - intensity ) and completed the study interventions .  
in the moderate - intensity group , 13 of the 18 women had higher paee on days with than without center - based exercise ( figure 1 ) , and the average paee on days with exercise ( 577.7  219.7  kcald ) was higher than on days without exercise ( 450.7  140.5  kcald , p = .011 ) ( table 1 ) .   yet , the difference ( 127.0  188.1  kcald ) was much smaller than the energy expended during exercise ( 325.0  79.6 kcald ) ( figure 2 ) , suggesting that , during the 5th month of exercise training , women expended less energy on activities outside of the structured exercise when they exercised during the day .   in support of this , paee on days with center - based exercise was not different from baseline paee ( 520.8  206.5  kcald ; p > .05 for both ) in women performing moderate - intensity exercise even though energy expended during exercise was included in the daily paee on days with exercise . on the other hand , in the vigorous - intensity group , 12 of the 18 women had lower paee on days with than without center - based exercise during the last month of the intervention ( figure 1 ) .
