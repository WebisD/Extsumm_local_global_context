we describe clinical , radiologic and pathologic findings of an exceedingly rare case of malignant teratoma of the proximal humerus .
a 14-yr - old female was admitted with painful limited motion of the left shoulder joint .
an extragonadal teratoma of the long bone has not been previously reported in the literature .
nevertheless , since the tumor was confirmed as a grade 1 immature teratoma , a wide surgical excision only was undertaken for comprehensive treatment .
teratomas are congenital tumors that are usually found in the gonads , and are only rarely detected in extragonadal areas , such as , the mediastinal , retroperitoneal and sacrococcygeal regions . to the best our knowledge ,
however , a radiograph of the humerus showed ill defined moth eaten to permeative destructive lesion associated with cortical perforation of proximal humerus ( fig .
thus , we are uncertain about the pathogenesis of the bony teratoma in this case .
1a ) . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) well demonstrated the entire extent of the tumor , which showed inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast agent administration .
a subsequent surgical biopsy was performed and the pathological report revealed an immature bony teratoma . on gross inspection ,
