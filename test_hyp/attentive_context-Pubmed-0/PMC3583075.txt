  , understanding sleep function is of central importance to biology .
in their companion article , tononi and cirelli argue that i have missed the big picture by conflating questions of sleep function with the underlying mechanisms . as i have discussed elsewhere
there are other theories of sleep function and many of the theoretical arguments made in support of shy ( e.g. , a need for offline states , sleep homeostasis , and brain metabolism ) apply to them .
the goal of science is to understand how nature works . that includes an empirical pursuit of physical mechanisms .
i find this an odd position to take and a backward step in our pursuit of sleep function .
the underlying message from tononi and cirelli is that what really matters is the  
my position is that this evaluation must always include a discussion of mechanisms , because they can not be disentangled from functional questions .  
scientists should therefore be skeptical of any theory of sleep function that fails to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that govern the proposed function . in this regard ,
this theory of the natural world was elegant , mathematical , and even highly predictive of astronomical events .
