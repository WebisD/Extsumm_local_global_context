meanwhile , the attenuated strain hx130709a was obtained from a highly virulent 
 clinical strain hx130709 after 55 passages on agar plates containing acriflavine . also , its 
 virulence had been confirmed in mice , which lays the foundation for a further study of 
 virulence factor of e. rhusiopathiae with proteomics and transcriptomic 
 technologies .
but , 
 there is also another possibility that the strain virulence was decreased during the 
 attenuation mainly by phenotype changes instead of genotype changes . in this study , we conclude that the acute swine erysipelas outbreaks in eastern china were 
 caused by serotype 1a e. rhusiopathiae strains with different biochemical 
 characteristics , and the virulence of serotype 1a e. rhusiopathiae strains 
 is unrelated with some point mutations in hypervariable region of the spaa 
 gene .
results of the drug susceptibility test showed that all the strains were highly sensitive 
 to a variety of antibiotics , such as pc - g , amp , cez , ctx , em , roxm and amo , and also 
 resistant to km and sxz , which well explained why swine erysipelas was easy to control with 
 the use of antibiotics .
it s possible that the mutations in the 
 genome which directly lead to virulence loss can not be detected by pfge with 
 smai digestion . in this case , comparing the entire genome of wild strain 
 and the attenuated strain may be a good way to understand the attenuation mechanism .
