toxicity and mutagenicity of eq were observed in in vivo and in vitro studies showing its potential harmful effects .
ethoxyquin has been used as an antioxidant in animal feed for several decades and despite the search for new compounds that could be used as free radical scavengers , it is still the most effective antioxidant .
the negative health effects in domestic animals fed with eq containing feed were observed some years ago , but the presence of its approved doses should not be hazardous .
additionally , the results of the studies on products of eq oxidation , especially eqdm , detected in farmed animal tissues indicate that it should be under control and some regulations should be introduced .
this makes it very important to label all products and ingredients to which eq is added and to comply with the recommended doses .
this paper presents characteristics of ethoxyquin with regard to its properties , metabolism , toxicity , possible carcinogenicity , and antioxidant activity .
the expression pattern of both phase i and ii enzymes involved in eq metabolism may vary in different animals and should be considered in relation to the ratio of parent eq and its metabolites ( first of all deq , qi , and eqdm ) in the liver   . the research concerning this issue is currently in progress .
