therefore , creating a humanlike eye with raw data from the human eye for biomechanical simulations using finite element analysis ( fea ) would help to investigate and better explain the physical and physiological responses to impact injuries.1 we have previously developed a simulation model resembling a human eye based on the information obtained from cadaver eyes and applied three - dimensional fea to determine the physical and mechanical conditions of impacting foreign bodies that cause an intraocular foreign body.15 this model human eye was also used in our studies on airbag impact in a postradial keratotomy eye and on a post - transsclerally fixated pc iol eye.4,16 in general , the capsular bag is considered the best position for iol implantation . when the capsular support is insufficient or absent , ciliary sulcus fixation or , more recently , scleral fixation , is recommended.4 in this study , we extended the simulation model after renovation to further determine the physical and mechanical response of an impacting airbag deploying at additional velocities on transsclerally fixated pc iol eyes with different axial lengths , especially surveying the mechanical threshold in a highly myopic eye .
were limited to the anterior segment , 6% to the posterior segment , and 44% to both.12 postcataract surgery patients with implantation of an intraocular lens ( iol ) may be at a higher risk with impact for wound rupture , subluxation of a posterior chamber ( pc ) iol , anterior capsule rupture , and dislocation of the lens.11,13,14 unlike with human bones and ribcages , the injury biomechanics of soft organs , such as human eyes , are difficult to simulate due to limited available mechanical information .
