, we aimed to establish whether spontaneous reporting via the yellow card scheme in the uk lends support to an association between congenital anomalies and the use of carbimazole or propylthiouracil in pregnancy .
data on all birth defects reported via the yellow card scheme in association with treatment with carbimazole or propylthiouracil between july 1963 and september 2010 was obtained in  drug analysis prints  from the mhra .
the drug analysis print from the mhra included 64 reports of birth defects following exposure to antithyroid drugs , reported between 1963 and 2010 .
drug analysis prints give a complete listing of all uk spontaneous suspected adrs reported through the yellow card scheme by healthcare professionals , patients , and the pharmaceutical industry to the mhra and chm .
this has important clinical implications , and prescribing physicians should be aware of the potential association with congenital anomalies whilst balancing this risk with that of uncontrolled maternal hyperthyroidism in pregnancy .
there are few birth defects associated with propylthiouracil , but this should be interpreted in the context of higher historical prescription rates for carbimazole .
, the yellow card scheme has allowed healthcare professionals involved in prescribing in the uk to report suspected serious adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) to the commission on human medicines ( chm)/medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency ( mhra ) .
