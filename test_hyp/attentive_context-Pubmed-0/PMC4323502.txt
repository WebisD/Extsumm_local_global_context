bone cement augmentation alone can be a safe and efficient option in patients with painful osteoporotic compression fracture and radiculopathy .
by categorizing fractures on the basis of fracture line , we found that inferior - type fractures were more related to the development of radiculopathic leg pain .
the 59 patients were divided into two groups , namely group a ( n=44 ) , back pain - only , and group b ( n=15 ) , back pain with newly developed unilateral leg pain .
between may 2008 and april 2010 , 238 patients underwent single - level vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic compression fractures in our institute .
although vertebral collapse was not severe in lumbar radiographs and mri , 10 of 15 patients in the group b showed compression fracture and suspicious impingement of the corresponding nerve root at the intervertebral foramen . in the analysis of fracture pattern under the l2 level , which showed radiculopathy , only the back pain group ( group a ) demonstrated symptoms relating to the superior fracture type .
however , the fracture pattern in the group with back and radiculopathic pains ( group b ) was mostly related to the inferior fracture type ( table 2 ) .
