however , one puzzling result of our research is that rab5 and rab21 , two other downstream targets of rabex-5 , are translocated  both to the axon and to the dendrites  of developing hippocampal neurons in a rabex-5-dependent manner ( fig . 
localization of rab17 in mouse hippocampal neurons is unique , because rab17 is the only rab isoform that is specifically targeted to the dendrites and is not targeted to the axon .
rab - type small gtpases are conserved membrane trafficking proteins in all eukaryotes , and they mediate various steps in membrane trafficking , including vesicle budding , vesicle movement along cytoskeletons , vesicle docking to specific membranes , and vesicle fusion .
our finding that rabex-5 determines the dendrite localization of its downstream target rab17 is highly consistent with a recent report showing that rab - gefs ( e.g. , rabex-5 and rabin8 ) are major determinants of specific rab membrane targeting .
the targeting of rab17 to the dendrites is neuronal differentiation stage - dependent : at an early stage ( 3 d of in vitro culture ) it localizes only in the cell body , whereas at a later stage ( 11 d of in vitro culture ) some of the rab17 is translocated from the cell body to the dendrites .
