we present a patient who developed septic shock as a result of p. multocida bacteremia , presumptively from an intra - abdominal infection .
p. multocida should be included in the microbiologic differential diagnosis in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases who presents with possible intra - abdominal infection , even without history of exposure to domestic animals .
a 52-year - old african american female was brought to the emergency department for generalized abdominal discomfort , altered mental status , diarrhea , fevers and chills for 4 - 5 days .
although cases of bacteremic p. multocida infections has been infrequently reported in the literature , clinicians should considered this organism as an important and potentially lethal pathogen in humans , where it can cause life - threatening infections .
admission diagnosis was systemic inflammatory response syndrome with sepsis and septic shock with multi - organic dysfunction syndrome , presumptively secondary to community - acquired pneumonia , possible biliary tract infection ( ascending cholangitis ) , probable spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( sbp ) and alcoholic hepatitis .
pasteurella multocida was first described by revolee in 1877 and further characterized by pasteur in 1880 .
p. multocida is a small gram - negative non - spore forming facultative anaerobe organism that is a natural inhabitant of the normal gastrointestinal flora and the upper respiratory tract of wild and domestic animals , especially cats and dogs .
