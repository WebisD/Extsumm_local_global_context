as predicted by modeling , we found significantly higher egg densities in wider refuges for tobacco budworm , at least for the combined ( 1996 ) and the 1997 h. virescens data . increased isolation between the refuges and bt - cotton allowed more of the reproductive effort of females emerging in refuges to be expended in the refuges , thus increasing the population of moths in the refuges .
the null hypothesis tested here is that refuge population density is independent of refuge width ( assuming that proportion of the total habitat devoted to refuges remains constant ) for the two major insect pests the tobacco budworm , heliothis virescens ( fabricius ) , and the cotton bollworm , helicoverpa zea ( boddie ) of the mid - south cotton agroecosystem .
the change in mean ( sem ) egg density as a function of embedded refuge width for three farms in 1996 .
theoretical considerations ( caprio 2001 ) suggest that this increase in population density would more than compensate for the increased isolation of the refuges . while individual moths emerging in the refuges would have a lower probability of mating with a resistant individual in the bt - crop , the overall probability that a resistant individual mating with an insect emerging out of the refuge would increase because of the greater refuge population size . the fine - scale structure of egg density within refuges was not investigated .
