we present a case of presumed ocular sarcoidosis diagnosed by ocular manifestation and treatment course , who developed tuberculous lymphadenopathy 6  years later without recurrence of ocular inflammation .
a 35-year - old female was referred to our department with severe visual impairment for months .
recent literatures renewed the interest in mycobacteria as a causative agent in sarcoidosis tissue   . here
tb could occur coincidently or in association with sarcoidosis , continued follow - up is important for patients with ocular sarcoidosis , even in silent case .
sarcoidosis is a multisystemic , granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that may affect any organ system .
the gold standard for diagnosis of sarcoidosis is histopathologic examination . considering the fact that ocular sarcoidosis may occur in the absence of apparent systemic involvement , and the fact that biopsy is usually reluctantly accepted by uveitis patients , the international workshop on ocular sarcoidosis ( iwos ) established an international criteria for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis .
our speculation is that the presumed ocular sarcoidosis might be triggered by tb antigen in extraocular infection , which reactivated and presented as tb lymphadenopathy 6  years later .
it is characterized by the accumulation of t lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes with the formation of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas in affected organs .
