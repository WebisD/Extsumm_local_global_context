the extensive application of nanomaterials in a wide range of products for human use poses a potential for toxicity risk to human health and the environment .
such adverse effects of nanomaterials on human health have triggered the development of a new scientific discipline known as " nanotoxicity " the study of the toxicity of nanomaterials.[1 - 7 ] discovery of nps sounded the last death knell for the occupational hygiene movement . in 1990s
furthermore , the potential use of new high throughput " predictive"toxicity " strategies , such as that envisioned in the recent nrc report " toxicity testing in the 21 century , " have emerged as possible solutions to deal with the issue of how to assess the safety of the thousands of chemicals to which humans are potentially exposed .
discovery of carbon nanoparticle ( np ) in 1980s was perhaps most important discovery of the last century .
it was accepted almost by consensus that statistical models of dose - response on which legislative limits are based may not be correct . while benefits of nanotechnology are widely publicized , the discussion of the potential effects of their widespread use in the consumer and industrial products are just beginning to emerge . acceptance of np toxicity led to wide acceptance of the fact that nanotoxicology , as a scientific discipline shall be quite different from occupational hygiene in approach and context . understanding the toxicity of nanomaterials and nano - enabled products is important for human and environmental health and safety as well as public acceptance . the scientific literature is a primary source of information about nanomaterial toxicology and thus plays a role in the emerging dialogue about the safety of nano - enabled products .
