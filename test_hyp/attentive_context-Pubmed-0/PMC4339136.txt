therefore , we analyzed muscle 
 activity under free walking , jogging (  8.7  km / h ) , and running (  8.8  km / h ) conditions on a 
 treadmill .
the average electromyographic activities of the vastus medial , tibialis anterior , medial 
 head of the gastrocnemius , and lateral head of the gastrocnemius were significantly higher 
 during jogging and running compared with walking .
the 
 present study found that the amount of activity in the soleus muscle was significantly 
 higher during running and jogging compared with the amounts of activity in the vastus 
 medialis , tibialis anterior , and gastrocnemius muscle , which are involved in walking . 

the hip adductors and vastus lateralis did not significantly 
 differ ( table 1table 1.average % mvc of muscles ( n=10)walkingjoggingrunningvastus medialis12.52.735.85.3 * 38.84.6*vastus lateralis17.16.136.38.137.76.8hip adductors31.26.741.07.250.17.1tibialis anterior14.31.329.33.8 * 37.63.0*lateral head of the gastrocnemius16.03.042.68.5 * 40.86.2*medial head of the gastrocnemius30.83.758.17.6 * 63.35.3*soleus18.45.039.67.844.86.2*values are meansse . * p<0.05 , vs. walking . ) .
the angle of the knee at initial contact , mid stance , and toe off significantly differed , 
 with the knee being more flexed during jogging and running than walking the knee being more
