point - of - care viral load assays for hepatitis b and c have the potential to bridge this gap and prove valuable tools for expansion of treatment globally
management of viral hepatitis is going through a revolution with the launch of new direct acting antivirals for hepatitis c treatment .
doctors in resource - limited settings are left virtually blindfolded in the management of their patients with hepatitis .
despite the huge burden of hepatitis b worldwide , with an estimated 350 million people chronically infected , very few patients in low- and middle - income countries are currently receiving antiviral treatment .
lack of access to viral load testing and antiviral treatment of hbv and hcv in resource - limited settings is a silent epidemic with major consequences .
an estimated 130150 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) globally , and the prevalence is higher in certain areas such as north africa and central and east asia . however , prior to starting treatment of hepatitis c , hcv rna measurements are required to establish the diagnosis of chronic hcv infection , which is a major obstacle in many places in the world .
