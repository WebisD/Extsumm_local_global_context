six months after treatment , we found no significant difference in calcium , phosphorus , parathyroid hormone ( pth ) , alkaline phosphatase ( akp ) , fgf-23 , or aacs between the two groups ( p>0.05 ) .
whether hfhd is better than low - flux hemodialysis ( lfhd ) is still under debate . in this study , we compared the efficacy of hfhd and lfhd in reducing vascular calcification and serum fgf-23 levels in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis .
hfhd is superior to lfhd and benefits hemodialysis patients by reducing serum fgf-23 levels and reducing vascular calcification .
multiple regression analysis indicated that older patients ( p=0.048 ) , those with higher blood phosphorus levels ( p=0.003 ) , and higher fgf-23 levels ( p=0.001 ) had significantly increased risks of aorta abdominalis calcification .
after 12 months of treatment , fgf-23 levels and aacs significantly decreased in the hfhd group , but not the lfhd group ( p=0.049 and p=0.002 , respectively ; table 2 ) .
fgf-23 levels and aacs in the hfhd group decreased by 41.423.4% and 30.040.3% respectively , while they increased by 0.326.4% and 76.45.6% in the lfhd group , respectively .
