short - term intrathecal triamcinolone - acetonide ( tca ) treatment significantly influences levels of two proteins expressed by astroglia : s-100b and tau protein , suggesting reduction of astrocytic activationin this study , short - term intrathecal tca treatment did not change neurofilament heavy - chain levels , suggesting the absence of a major neuroprotective treatment effectfuture treatment trials may investigate whether hyperacute treatment with intrathecal tca may reduce the inflammatory component of glia in the setting of severe transverse myelitis in multiple sclerosis and possibly also neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders , and thus improve the clinical outcome
future treatment trials may investigate whether , in addition to symptomatic effects , tca can reduce the inflammatory component of glia in the setting of severe transverse myelitis in ms and possibly also neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders , and thus improve the clinical outcome .
intrathecal tca is an efficient therapeutic way to treat spasticity and spare ms patients the discomfort of wearing a corset .
this prospective study aimed to investigate the effects of repeated tca applications on the csf markers suggestive of neurodegeneration : tau protein , s-100b , and nfh in ms patients with severe spasticity .
statistical analysis : friedman test , wilcoxon test concentration of s-100b protein during the first cycle of triamcinolone - acetonide ( tca ) therapy . statistical analysis : friedman test , wilcoxon test the results for nfh , tau protein , and s-100b did not differ significantly between the relapsing ms  remitting ms patient group and the primary progressive ms patient group .
