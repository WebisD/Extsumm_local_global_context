it is hoped that this paper will 
 provide medical professionals and students some 
 overview of what rfid technology can potentially do 
 for medical applications , effectively motivating and 
 facilitating them to utilize this valuable technology not 
 only for the improvement of patient treatments , but also 
 to possibly develop particular rfid devices , in 
 collaboration with other disciplines such as biomedical 
 and electrical engineering , for specific medical needs .
our main objective is not to present 
 specific rfid systems for these medical practices , 
 which are outside the scope of our research and requires 
 significant collaborated efforts between different 
 disciplines , but to give ideas that can possibly lead to significant improvements in medical examinations and 
 monitoring of patients .
we have presented several ideas using rfid 
 technology , one of the most significantly developed and 
 advanced technologies in the past decade , for personal 
 health examination and monitoring .
, we present several ideas of using rfid 
 technology for personal health examination and 
 monitoring .
rfid is 
 very attractive for medical applications and if properly 
 utilized can potentially lead to breakthroughs in the way 
 medical examinations and monitoring of patients are 
 conducted . in this paper
it is 
 believed that implementing the rfid technology would 
 not only help reduce the enormous and significantly 
 growing medical costs in the u.s.a . , but also help 
 improve the health treatment capability as well as 
 enhance the understanding of long - term personal health 
 and illness .
