the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence , distribution , position , and depth of impacted third molars ( itms ) in turkish orthodontic patients from a single academic institution .
our study showed that third molar impaction was present in 54.1% of a group of turkish orthodontic patients aged between 20 and 39 years , with no significant gender differences , and this frequency is the highest , thus far , to be reported in a turkish population .
mesioangular and distoangular inclinations were the most common in the mandible and the maxilla , respectively . of all itms ,
we retrospectively reviewed the panoramic radiographs , intraoral photographs , and dental casts of 207 patients ( 62 men and 145 women ; age , 20 - 39 years ; mean age , 22.7  3.29 years ) who had undergone orthodontic treatment .
there was no significant difference between the distribution of maxillary and mandibular itms in men and women ( p = 0.97 ) .
distribution of levels of impacted third molars in the maxilla and mandible in our patient population , 86 patients presented with bilateral impaction ( 76.8% of all subjects with itms ) [ table 6 ] . the frequencies of maxillary and mandibular bilateral impaction were similar ( 30.2% , and 24.4% , respectively ) .
