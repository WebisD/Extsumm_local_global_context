productive infection of primary hiv - specific cd8 t cells may lead to an early disruption of the   ag repertoire of hiv - specific cd8 t cells .
the apparent resistance of neonatal cd4 and cd8 t cell subsets to t - tropic hiv   could be related to the recent finding that anti - cd3/b7 activated naive cd4 t cells isolated from adult blood are   also resistant to t - tropic hiv , as a result of postentry block   in viral replication ( 1720 ) .     to be susceptible to hiv infection
consistent with their susceptibility to infection with m - tropic hiv , activated neonatal t cells expressed ccr5 mrna ( fig .
both cd8 and   cd4 t cell subsets supported significant replication of the   macrophage tropic ( m - tropic ) , but not the t - tropic , strain   of hiv ( fig .
it is tempting   to relate the hiv susceptibility of neonatal cd8 t cells to   the rapid progression of the disease in a large proportion of   infected neonates . since viral replication
3 , a and b ) . thus , activated neonatal cd8 t cells can be productively infected by primary   m - tropic hiv isolates , responsible for disease transmission ,   but not by t - tropic hiv .
