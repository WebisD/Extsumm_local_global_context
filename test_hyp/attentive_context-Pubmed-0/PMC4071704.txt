the number of patients who required dobutamine infusion was lower in s group ( p < 0.01 ) , whereas the number of patients requiring norepinephrine infusion was not significantly different between the two groups ( p < 0.23 ; table 3 ] .
this prospective double - blind randomized control study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of oral sildenafil preoperatively in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension undergoing mitral valve replacement surgeries .
characteristics of patients with mitral valve disease and pulmonary hypertension treated with sildenafil versus placebo hemodynamic parameters , i. e. hr , map , and pcwp were similar in both groups after induction , after weaning from cpb , and in the postoperative period [ table 2 ] .
postoperative parameters like ventilation time and postoperative icu ( intensive care unit ) stay time was significantly lower in sildenafil group ( p = 0.011 ) as compared with control group [ table 3 ] . during study , there was one mortality due to low output noted in control group on second postoperative day .
spap and mpap were significantly lower ( p < 0.0001 ) during t1-t5 times in sildenafil group as compared with the control group [ table 2 ] .
