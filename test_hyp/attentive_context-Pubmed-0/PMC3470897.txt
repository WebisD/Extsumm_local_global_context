logistic regression analysis showed a significantly increased risk for knee oa for the 9/9 genotype compared with the + 9/+9 genotype ( or = 2.35 , 95% ci : 1.4093.937 ; p < 0.001 ) after adjustment with sex , age , bmi , smoke status , history of labor work , regular exercise , and knee activity .
, we investigated whether bdkrb2 gene polymorphisms influence the susceptibility of oa in a chinese cohort .
this finding suggests that the bdkrb2 + 9/9 polymorphisms may be used as a genetic marker for the onset and development of oa .
a total of 245 patients with primary knee oa were recruited from dec 2008 to feb 2009 .
however , its relation with oa remains unknown . in this study , we enrolled knee oa patients to explore the role of bdkrb2 in oa .
besides , the + 9/9 and 9/9 genotypes represented higher risks of being severer oa than + 9/+9 carriers . to the best of our knowledge ,
obesity prevalence was significantly higher in the oa patient group than in controls ( p = 0.013 ) .  

the + 9/9 and 9/9 genotypes represented higher risks of being severer oa ( or = 3.09 , p < 0.001 , and or = 2.98 , p = 0.002 , resp . ) .
