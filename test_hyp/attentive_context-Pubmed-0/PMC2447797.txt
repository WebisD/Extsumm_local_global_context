targetrna operates under the assumption that the basepair - binding potential of two genomic sequences , corresponding to an srna and a mrna target , can serve as a predictor , albeit imperfect , for the interaction of the two rnas .
vogel and wagner ( 9 ) offer a comprehensive review of approaches , both computational and experimental , for identifying targets of bacterial srnas .
however , other factors that may contribute to srna : mrna interactions , such as rna secondary structure or the role of hfq , are not modeled by the program . as more examples of srna : mrna interactions are reported across a range of bacteria , we will gain a better understanding of the various rna properties and components within the cell that contribute to the interactions , and computational methods that aid in investigation of these interactions can be evolved appropriately to incorporate the new insights .
the webserver consists of a 16 cpu parallel computing cluster , and targetrnas underlying search algorithm has been designed for parallel computation , in order to increase performance and to process efficiently a large number of sequence submissions .
further , most srnas in this class bind to the rna chaperone hfq , which has been shown to facilitate the interaction between many srnas and their targets ( 2 ) . here
