hence , this study was carried out to examine the effect of vitamin b12 and folic acid supplementation on neuropsychiatric manifestations , cd4 count , and anthropometric measurements in hiv - positive patients .
this study has examined the effect of supplementation of vitamin b12 and folic acid on the neuropsychiatric manifestations , immunological response , and anthropometric measurements in three different groups of hiv patients , namely , hiv patients with tuberculosis , hiv patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations , and asymptomatic hiv patients . the mean age of the patient population was 38.00  8.12 years and was comparable between these three hiv groups . in a study conducted by jiamton et al . on impact of multiple micronutrient supplementation on mortality among hiv - infected individuals , the median age was 32 years .
ham - d scores were higher in groups i and ii compared to group iii because of the advanced nature of the disease in both groups and specific cns involvement in group ii .
the median folic acid level was lower in group ii compared to group i and iii , which may be because of cachexia induced malnutrition and decreased absorption of folic acid due to advanced disease in this group .
