therefore , the purpose of the present study was to mimic the conditions present during myocardial ischemia by lowering oxygen and serum concentrations during culture in order to determine the effects of these conditions on the gene expression and secretion of vegf , mcp-1 , mip-1 , mip-1 , and mmp-2 by bone marrow msc .
differential regulation of these paracrine factors by hypoxic and low serum conditions as demonstrated in this study may be important in the beneficial effects of msc injection during the ischemia present following coronary artery occlusion .
this study clearly demonstrates that alteration of oxygen concentrations and serum levels results in significant changes in the mrna expression for and secretion of paracrine factors by msc .
other investigators have demonstrated an increase in vegf gene expression and secretion   and a decrease in the secretion of mcp-1   by msc in hypoxia .
serum deprivation led to an increase in the gene expression and secretion of igf-1 , leptin , and angiogenin   by msc .
in addition , hypoxia increased gene expression for placental growth factor , heparin - binding epidermal growth factor , mmp-9 , and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf )   , caused an increase in the secretion of transforming growth factor-2 , insulin - like growth factor binding proteins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 , insulin - like growth factor- ( igf- ) ii , and interleukin-7   , and reduced the secretion of stromal cell derived factor-1 , macrophage colony stimulating factor , interleukin-1ra , rantes , cxcl1 , and cxcl10   by msc . clearly , hypoxia changes the paracrine secretions of msc which would have implications for the role they play in maintaining myocardial function after coronary artery occlusion .
