serum levels of ast and alt were higher among patients with obi in comparison to anti - hbc positive hbv dna negative individuals , but the difference failed to reach standard significance ( p = 0.13 and p = 0.07 ) , respectively .
overall , 29/96 ( 29.2% ) of patients were reactive for anti - hbc , an indication of prior exposure to hbv dna , and majority 6/8 ( 75% ) of the patients were female ( table 2 ) .
thus , in the total study population , 21/188 ( 11.2% ) of patients were identified as obi and 62.5% of the obi patients had cd4 count less than 200  cells / mm .
overall , the present study highlights the need for screening hbv before the initiation of any haart containing anti - hbv regimens in hbv / hiv coinfected patients .
some studies have reported an association between obi and elevated transaminase ; therefore identification of obi is of importance .
the distribution of the study participants as per the 1993 revised classification system for hiv infection and expanded surveillance case definition for aids among adolescents and adults was as shown in table 4 .
