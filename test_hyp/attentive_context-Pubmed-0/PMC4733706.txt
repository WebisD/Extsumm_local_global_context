the irls - rs , psqi , hama , and hamd scores in the fourteen idiopathic rls patients irls - rs : international rls rating scale ; psqi : pittsburgh sleep quality index ; hama : hamilton anxiety scale ; hamd : hamilton depression scale . * different from  baseline , p<0.05 .
based on the common mechanism involving disturbances in the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system between rls and pd , we investigated whether rtms application to the cortex was beneficial in patients with rls .
all of the irls - rs , psqi and hama scores showed continuous and significant improvement posttreatment compared to baseline .
this proved the effect of rtms in treating rls and that the effect could last for some time ( at least 2 months , according to our study ) after the stimulation .
our results indicated a significant improvement in irls - rs scores after 14 sessions , from 23.86  5.88 to 11.21  7.23 .
we included fourteen idiopathic rls patients treated at the sleep clinic of our hospital between 2011 and 2012 that were diagnosed according to the international criteria of the international restless legs syndrome study group set in 2003 .
the international rls rating scale ( irls - rs ) , pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) , hamilton anxiety scale ( hama ) and hamilton depression scale ( hamd ) were used to evaluate the severity of rls , quality of sleep , and the severity of anxiety and depression , respectively .
