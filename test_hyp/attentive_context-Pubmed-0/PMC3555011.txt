the in - vitro drug release was studies with usp xxii dissolution apparatus in both simulated gastric fluid and intestine fluid for a period of 24 h. the results of dissolution studies indicated that formulations f11 and f12 produced controlled effect with 99.72% and 98.70% of drug release over a period of 24 h than compared with other formulations .
the current study aims at developing oral controlled release tablets of losartan potassium , using matrices hpmc k100 m and carbopol 934p , xanthan gum with chitosan , and trisodium citrate as a cross - linking agent .
the in - vitro drug release was studied with usp - ii ( paddle type ) dissolution apparatus in both stimulated gastric fluid ( ph 1.2 ) and intestinal fluid ( ph 6.8 phosphate buffer ) for 24 h [ table 4 ] .
the granules were punched into tablet and evaluated by post compression parameter like weight variation , hardness , friability , and drug content .
the objective of the present was to investigate the possibility of controlling of losartan potassium release from matrix tablet prepared by different polymers .
composition of losartan potassium control release matrix tablet ( f1-f12 ) fourier transforms infra - red ( ftir ) study was carried out to check compatibility of drug with polymers .
