as shown in our study , the reference values of the fetal gall bladder in the korean population are not statistically different from those of the caucasian and african - american populations , and non - visualization of the fetal gall bladder is a relatively common finding with little clinical significance as a sign of fetal abnormality .
the fetal gall bladder can commonly be seen as a fluid filled structure during antenatal sonography and the normative data of the fetal gall bladder throughout gestation has been established in caucasian and african - american populations ( 1 - 2 ) . the application of those normative data may be inappropriate for evaluation of the fetal gall bladder in other populations , however , if ethnic differences between populations have not been compared . in our larger study of 1,911 fetuses , we provided reference values for the growth of the fetal gall bladder throughout gestation in the korean population .
the lengths of the fetal gall bladder were not statistically different from those of the caucasian and african - american populations , which suggests that there is no need to consider ethnicity when interpreting the size of fetal gall bladder in asian , african - american and caucasian populations .
