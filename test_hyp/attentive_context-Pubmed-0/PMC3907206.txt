in this case study we illustrate the use of a tissue perfusion assessment system to assess flap viability in a patient undergoing a nipple - sparing radical mastectomy with an unusual incision site .
this study illustrates the use of the spy elite system to assess flap viability following a nipple - sparing radical mastectomy with an unusual incision site .
this study shows that uncommon surgical practices can be performed successfully when technology is used to complement good clinical judgment in assessing tissue perfusion .
a modified radical mastectomy is a procedure in which the entire breast is removed ; including the skin , areola , nipple , and level i and level ii axillary lymph nodes , but the pectoralis major muscle is spared . in breast cancer cases with pectoral muscle involvement a radical mastectomy may need to be done if there is persistence of disease despite neoadjuvant chemoradiation . in a radical mastectomy
1 is an imaging system used as an adjunctive method for the evaluation of tissue perfusion in surgical procedures where additional perfusion information is needed .
the surgeon is provided with an on - table assessment of breast skin perfusion that facilitates identification and removal of poorly perfused tissue that results in decreases complication rates .
