we present a rare case of thoracic vertebrae compression fracture due to extranodal rdd without lymphadenopathy .
skeletal involvement of rdd is unusual and sole manifestation of spine vertebra is extremely rare .
sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy known as rosai - dorfman disease ( rdd ) was first described in 1965 and identified as a distinct clinicopathologic entity in 196915 ) .
rdd is a rare histiocytic proliferative disorder of unknown etiology usually characterized by painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy3 ) .
the present case is a rare example of compression fracture caused by isolated extranodal rdd involved the thoracic spine without lymphadenopathy .
a 15-year - old man presented with intermittent midthoracic back pain for about 6 months after slip down during basketball .
skeletal involvement as a sole manifestation of rdd is extremely rare , occurring in fewer than 2% of all rdd patients and arise most frequently in long bones such as tibia , femur , humerus , clavicle and bones of the hands2 ) .
if the young adult or adolescent have compression of vertebra body , rdd can be considered as our case .
because of its rarity , various clinical manifestations and radiologic findings , it was difficult to differentiate from other disease such as langerhans cell histiocytosis or eosinophilic granuloma on radiologic study alone , so pathologic confirmation was needed .
