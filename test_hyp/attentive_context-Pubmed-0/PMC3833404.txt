a study showed that the improvement of ir , following diet and/or surgery - induced weight loss , was associated with the magnitude of decrease in serum pedf levels and pedf expression of adipose tissue . in this context , the present study was undertaken to get insights into the effect of metformin on the expression and secretion of pedf in adipocyte and hepatocyte and whether this effect is associated with the ir - improving action of the agent , which may help to clarify pharmacological action of metformin .
in addition , the mrna expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( pepck ) and glucose 6-phosphatase ( g-6-pase ) , in the liver were also significantly upregulated in the high - fat diet induced obese rats ( figure 1 ) . with metformin treatment for 4 weeks , the ir of the high - fat diet induced obese rats was obviously improved , manifested as enhanced glucose infusion rate , reduced serum tg and serum insulin levels , and down - regulated mrna expression of pepck , g-6-pase ( table 2 , figure 1 ) .
our data showed metformin inhibits pedf production and release , and ampk plays a key role in this process , which is closely associated with the improvement of ir .
