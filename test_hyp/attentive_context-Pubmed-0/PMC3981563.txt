the differential capability to promote in vitro endothelial cell proliferation was correlated with the presence and level of a variety of cytokines , analysed with the multiplex technology , and , for the hf patients , with relevant clinical parameters , such as ntpro - bnp levels and occurrence of cardiovascular events in the follow - up .
in our study , by employing a standardized in vitro endothelial proliferation assay , we have demonstrated for the first time the following : ( i ) endothelial cell proliferation in response to serum samples from healthy individuals increased with age and was coupled to different serum levels of proangiogenic cytokines , including vegf and il-8 ; ( ii ) the endothelial cell proliferation index determined in response to serum samples from hf patients was correlated with circulating levels of several proinflammatory / proangiogenic cytokines ( il-12p70 , mcp-1 , mip1 , il-8 , and vegf ) , with il-12p70 showing a positive correlation also with the levels of levels of ntpro - bnp ; ( iii ) hf patient sera exhibiting high endothelial proliferation activity could indicate a higher risk for the patient of worsening the disease .
it should also be noticed that although most experimental studies point to a positive role of angiogenic cytokines at the cardiac level , few studies have addressed the potential role of circulating proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines in patients with hf . since human serum contains a myriad of cytokines , a major limitation to the study of the proangiogenic capability of human serum is also due by the fact that most in vitro and in vivo angiogenic tests are complex and not easy to be reproduced   . on these bases , in the present study , we have adopted a simple and reproducible in vitro endothelial cell proliferation assay in order to investigate the proangiogenic effects of human sera obtained from both healthy individuals and from a limited group of hf patients .
