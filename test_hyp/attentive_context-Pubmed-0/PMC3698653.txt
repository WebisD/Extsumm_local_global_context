the aim of the present study was to verify the effects of n-3lc pufa supplementation on plasma levels of ppar  and thyroid hormones in obesity .
clinical variables at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention in two groups as shown in table 2 , plasma t3 , t4 and tsh levels in n-3lc pufa and placebo groups were 1.80  0.02 , 8.06  0.37 and 2.26  0.36 , respectively , after supplementation . among the thyroid hormones ,
first , we could not assess differential effects of epa and dha in this study and second was short duration of the intervention .
eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1,000 mg of n-3lc pufa capsules containing 180 mg of epa and 120 mg of dha ( n=33 ) or 1,000 mg of paraffin as placebo ( n=33 ) twice a day for 4 weeks .
pufas act via nuclear receptors such as ppar  and thyroid hormones . in this study , we assessed the effect of epa and dha on plasma levels of ppar  , and thyroid hormones . as a result of our study [ table 2 ] , ppar  levels had no significant changes after 4 weeks .
