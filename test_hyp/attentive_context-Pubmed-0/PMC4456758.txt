a combination of forsus ffrd and headgear can bring about dramatic changes in the management of space deficiency and correction of class ii malocclusions .
this case report demonstrates the efficiency of the combined clinical use of headgear and forsus with fixed appliance to distalize the maxillary molar and also to advance the mandible .
the forsus ( forsus fatigue resistant device [ ffrd ] ) is a semirigid telescoping system incorporating a superelastic nickel - titanium coil spring that can be assembled chair - side .
the effects of several compliance - free appliances for mandibular anterior repositioning in association with fixed appliances have been investigated .
one of the recommended therapeutic approaches to class ii malocclusion in growing patients is functional jaw orthopedics for mandibular advancement .
fixed devices for sagittal advancement of the mandible can be used in association with fixed mechanotherapy and is a recent advancement .
combinations of dental and skeletal factors ranging from mild to severe are multiple characters of this discrepancy . the treatment protocols for class ii can vary widely according to professional ability , time of treatment , severity of malocclusion and patient compliance .
optimal timing for class ii treatment with fixed functional appliance is at the pubertal growth spurt with enhanced mandibular skeletal changes and minimal dentoalveolar compensation .
