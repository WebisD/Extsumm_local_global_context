these results suggest that the right cea is more strongly activated in response to the auditory 
 cs . in the present study ,
these results 
 suggest that the right cea shows a greater degree of activation in response to an auditory cs .
when fear - conditioned subjects were re - exposed to the auditory cs , they showed fear responses , such as increased freezing and decreased walking . along with these 
 behavioral responses , fear - conditioned subjects exhibited activation of the bla and cea , as assessed by fos expression .
fear - conditioned subjects showed fear responses and an increment of fos expression in the amygdala simultaneously .
although lateralized brain function has been reported for both fear 
 conditioning and other phenomena , the biological significance of lateralization has yet to be clarified .
( a ) duration of freezing and frequency of walking ( mean + sem ) and ( b ) the number of 
 fos - immunoreactive cells ( mean + sem ) in the basolateral complex of the amygdala ( bla ) and central amygdala ( cea ) of fear - conditioned and non - conditioned 
 subjects . * p<0.05 according to a manova followed by fisher s plsd post hoc test for behavioral results , and according to a student s
