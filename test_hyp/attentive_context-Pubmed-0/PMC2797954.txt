larger studies are needed to reach more solid conclusions regarding the effects of did on fbg , body weight , and insulin dosage .
this also translated into a marked improvement in treatment satisfaction , thus suggesting that the use of telemedicine can increase the level of acceptance of insulin treatment and help patients cope with the disease
this improvement in metabolic control was obtained by devoting to carbohydrate counting education a median ( range ) of 6 ( 215 ) h in the did group and 12 ( 2.525 ) h in the standard group ( p = 0.07 ) .
it is worth mentioning that , despite the use of lower doses of long - acting insulin , patients assigned to the did group showed a reduction in fpg levels during the study , whereas levels slightly increased in the control group .
furthermore , although we found no differences in mean daily doses of short - acting insulin between the two groups ( did group 20.6  8.2 iu / day and standard group 20.1  7.8 iu / day ; p = 0.92 ) , mean daily doses of long - acting insulin were lower in the did group than in the standard group , although statistical significance was not reached ( did group 17.4  7.4 iu / day and standard group 21.4  10.0 iu / day ; p = 0.12 ) .
