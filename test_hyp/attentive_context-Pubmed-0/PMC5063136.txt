recently , ivabradine17 and lcz696 , a combination of the new neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril ( ahu377 ) with valsartan,18 have attracted attention for the treatment of hf .
subsequently , the assessment of treatment with lisinopril and survival study5 investigated whether ace inhibitors had favourable effects on the outcome of patients with hf with reduced ef in a dosedependent manner . in this trial ,
if the efficacy and safety of supramaximaldose valsartan were well acknowledged in this field , it would be helpful to investigate the appropriate dose of lcz696 more precisely .
two benchmark randomized controlled trials , namely the cooperative north scandinavian enalapril survival study7 and the studies of left ventricular dysfunction treatment trial,8 demonstrated that ace inhibitors reduce mortality and improved new york heart association class , exercise capacity and cardiac function in patients with hf with reduced ef .
because of the different mechanism of action of ace inhibitors and arbs in blocking the raas , combination therapy of an ace inhibitor and an arb was thought to be attractive for the treatment of hf as well as the monotherapy with an arb . in the valsartan heart failure trial,14 the addition of valsartan to conventional therapy for hf resulted in a significant decrease in cardiovascular events compared to placebo ( relative risk 0.87 , 97.5% ci 0.770.97 , p  =  0.009 ) ; however , a post hoc analysis indicated increased mortality and complications in the subgroup taking an ace inhibitor , valsartan , and a betablocker .
