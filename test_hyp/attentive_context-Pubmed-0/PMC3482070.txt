to our knowledge , this is the first report of a clinical trial to investigate the monoclonal complement inhibitor eculizumab in a patient with mixed cryoglobulinemia and severe glomerulonephritis .
furthermore , eculizumab has been successfully used preemptive prior to kidney transplantation   or postoperatively to prevent disease recurrence in the allograft   in several cases with complement disorder - associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome . here , we report on an exceptional case of mixed essential cryoglobulinemia with severe glomerulonephritis characterized by a prominent infiltration of the glomeruli by neutrophils . a 1-patient clinical trial of eculizumab was attempted to investigate whether complement inhibition would be sufficient to inhibit this relapsing glomerulonephritis .
, eculizumab has been approved from the fda for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome , in whom the control of complement activation is insufficient .
cryoglobulinemia is a rare disease and is characterized by igs that precipitate in the cold .
in humans , cryoglobulinemia can be responsible for a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( mpgn ) , which is characterized by the formation and/or deposition of immunoglobulins ( igs ) and complement in the glomeruli , followed by an influx of inflammatory cells   .
human data of cryoglobulinemia are scarce , the present 1-patient trial report demonstrating the response to eculizumab  whether considered partially positive or negative  might be of use for the medical community .
