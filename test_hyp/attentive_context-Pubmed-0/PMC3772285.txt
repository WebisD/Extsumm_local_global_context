we retrospectively examined the medical records and ct scans of 259 consecutive patients who diagnosed as csdh from january 2006 to december 2011 .
we excluded 17 patients who diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) only before surgery .
mixed density of csdh results from multiple episodes of trauma , especially in the oldest age .
computed tomography ( ct ) remains the preferred diagnostic method for the chronic subdural hematoma ( csdh)3 ) .
the csdhs were classified into four groups ; hypodensity ( < 25 hu ) , homogeneous isodensity ( 25 - 35 hu ) , layered type , and mixed type on the basis of ct scans ( fig .
repeated episodes of acute bleeding may result mixed densities of sdh . in other words ,
the csdh was on the left side in 115 patients , on the right side in 70 patients , and bilateral 40 patients ( table 2 ) .
the density of csdh was isodense in 115 patients , hypodense in 31 patients , mixed in 79 cases , and layered in 17 cases ( table 1 ) . mixed or layered types were more common in the oldest age , while isodense or hypodense sdhs were more common the age of less than 70 years ( p=0.0002 by fisher ) .
