we herewith describe a patient of ods in the face of a slow correction of hyponatremia and associated hypokalemia .
rapid correction of hyponatremia is a known risk factor for the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome ( ods ) , a disorder characterized by the wide spread development of demyelination in the pontine as well as the extra - pontine regions .
a 47-year - old non - alcoholic male presented to the er with altered sensorium .
neurological examination revealed generalized spastic quadriparesis , mutism and inability to swallow , characteristic of a pseudobulbar state with spontaneous eye opening consistent with the diagnosis of locked - in - syndrome .
our case illustrates the development of ods in graded correction of hyponatremia and emphasizes the possible pathogenetic role of associated hypokalemia .
the patient received supportive treatment for about a month when he succumbed to intercurrent sepsis .
first described in alcoholic and malnourished patients who developed neurological symptoms in association with non - inflammatory demyelination within the pons , the demyelination was then reported in extrapontine areas like basal ganglia , cerebral white matter , peripheral cortex , hippocampi , and lateral geniculate bodies . seen in up to 10% cases of ods ,
