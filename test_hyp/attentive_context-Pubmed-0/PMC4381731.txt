, we have been able to detail the typical longitudinal variation of serum cytokines throughout pregnancy in this cohort of women .
, it seems that the description of pregnancy in terms of type 2 immune responses may be oversimplified , both in the overall description of key cytokines / growth factors as well as in the temporal dynamics , and it is in need of further refinement .
successful pregnancy has previously been described as predominantly a type 2 immune response - biased phenomenon   . in light of the collective evidence
our superimposed growth curves of il-15 ( figure 4 ) and il-1 ( figure s3 ) , the cytokines with the strongest association with gestational week as a linear covariate , suggest that this change begins at approximately week 20 and peaks just after week 30 .
our results suggest that the third trimester of pregnancy is characterized by an increasingly inflammatory ( e.g. , il-1 , il-6 , il-12 , il-15 , ip-10 , and scd40 ligand ) as well as counterregulatory ( e.g. , il-1ra and flt3-ligand ) milieu compared to earlier stages of pregnancy .
specifically , we identified significantly higher levels of gro , tgf , egf , pdgf - aa , and pdgf - ab / bb and significantly lower levels of scd40l , ip-10 , il-6 , il-17 , il-13 , and mcp-1 in the baseline pregnancy samples ( table 1 ) . when all longitudinal samples were included in a pca , no difference
