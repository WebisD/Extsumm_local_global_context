this review will synthesize the data detailing the response of rr to ionizing radiation ( ir ) and will provide a perspective on the use of rr inhibitors as radiosensitizers in the treatment of human cancers . over the years , many groups have explored the use of rr inhibitors as chemotherapeutics in their own right , or as adjuncts to dna damaging molecules , particularly in hematologic malignancies . while this area looks promising , this subject will not be reviewed here .
it will be interesting to follow the development of the field in the next 510  years , particularly with the clinical trials of triapine in cervical cancer , and hopefully at least one of the many rr inhibitors being studied will eventually bring additional therapeutic benefit to patients in the near future .
what should be clear is that rr is involved in the cellular response to ir and targeting it is both rational and likely desirable in enhancing the treatment of cancers with ir .
ribonucleotide reductase ( rr ) inhibitors have been studied as radiation sensitizers for over 30  years in both the lab and the clinic .
as outlined in the review above , the story began with the study of hu in combination with ir in a number of pre - clinical trials in the 1960s , leading to a large amount of interest in the clinic , culminating with the gog adopting hu and ir as its standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer . while its success in this arena was short
