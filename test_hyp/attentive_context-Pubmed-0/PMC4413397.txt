new formulations of basal insulin that are under development are u300 glargine , which has completed phase iii and pegylated insulin lispro , which is in phase iii , insulin degludec / insulin aspart ( idegasp ) , which is a soluble co - formulation of insulin degludec and insulin aspart , and ideglira , which is a fixed - ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide for t2 dm .
the need for basal insulin was felt around 60 years ago , and so longer - acting insulins like lectin and neutral protamine hagedorn ( nph ) were developed .
studies have also shown that missing two basal insulin injections per week can lead to a 0.20.3% increase in glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) . at the same time , existing basal insulins were found to have limitations . in order to counter these limitations , insulin analogues were developed .
there are three kinds of insulin analogues : rapid - acting insulin analogues , biphasic insulin analogues , and basal insulin analogs .
over the past few decades continuous progress has been made in the development of insulin therapy .
the need of insulin analogues arises from the fact that the human insulin injections have a lag period of around 1/2 h between administration and onset of action . as a result ,
