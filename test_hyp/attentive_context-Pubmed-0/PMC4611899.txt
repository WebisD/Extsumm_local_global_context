posttraumatic cerebral edema leading to refractory intracranial hypertension is the main prognostic factor in brain - injured patients .
early decompressive craniotomy ( dc ) is a method for decreasing raised icp and has been associated with better outcomes . in neonates ,
as the cranial sutures are open , any associated fracture may relieve the raised icp due to craniotomy flap - elevation like effect .
the combined medical and surgical objective during the acute phase is to prevent raised intracranial pressure ( icp ) and maintain cerebral perfusion pressure in order to limit the development of secondary lesions .
linear undisplaced fracture in neonates along with open sutures may act as a dc relieving the raised icp almost immediately .
hence , a close clinical and radiological follow - up is essential . as the effect of decompression
an 8-day - old male child was brought to the emergency room with a history of fall from a cradle of about 3 feet height followed by loss of consciousness for half an hour .
morbidity and mortality occur as a result of transtentorial herniation caused by mass effect due to cerebral swelling .
this brain swelling is associated with an exponential rise in the icp and eventually leads to brain herniation syndromes . in infants with open sutures ,
