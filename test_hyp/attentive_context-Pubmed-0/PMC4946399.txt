the patient we report here is a 48-year old woman who was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and was treated with standard therapy corticosteroids and aza .
mmf in combination with corticosteroid was opted as second - line treatment and the patient was able to achieve remission with these treatments .
autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) is an immune - mediated chronic liver disease characterized by hepatocellular inflammation , necrosis , and fibrosis , which can progress to cirrhosis and fulminant hepatic failure if left untreated .
unfortunately after 27 months of corticosteroid monotherapy , hepatitis flare recurred and was stabilized with addition of aza but again the same side effect , pancytopenia and alopecia developed .
like other studies , alternative treatment with mmf was considered as a good option and we expect better treatment response for our patient as she had shown sufficient response to aza .
a 48 year - old woman was admitted to department of hepatology due to fatigue and jaundice which lasted for approximately 10 days .
2a , b ) . based on the lab findings and fluctuation of ast and alt levels , diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis type
standard treatment of aih includes corticosteroids alone or in combination with azathioprine ( aza ) that aims at the normalization of transaminase and immunoglobulin g ( igg ) levels in serum which correlate with histological disease activity .
