although these objects are extracted either by endoscopy or laparoscopic gastrostomy , we devised an innovative technique by using pneumatic gastric insufflation and extracted the toothbrush by a tiny gastrotomy under local anesthesia .
early removal of the toothbrush is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality . in cases where endoscopic removal fails ,
the pylorus , duodenal c - loop , and ileocecal valve are the three physiological narrowings in the gastrointestinal tract , and most of the swallowed indigestible foreign bodies pass through it without complications . however , foreign bodies such as a toothbrush can not pass out of the stomach , and the gastrointestinal tract should get rid of these objects as soon as possible to avoid pressure necrosis and gastrointestinal perforation .
a swallowed toothbrush is a rare occurrence and it never passes through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously .
x - ray of the abdomen suggested the presence of a foreign body and a computed tomography ( ct ) scan was done which confirmed a toothbrush lying in the stomach [ figures 1 , 2 ] .
endoscopy still remains an aid in performing surgical gastrotomy for delivering such complex foreign bodies under local anesthesia .
