the presence of high rate of haemonchus parasites in the study areas was responsible for the loss of production in sheep .
therefore , the study was designed with the objective of assessing the prevalence of ovine haemonchosis and its associated risk factors .
in this study a total of 384 sheep were examined using postmortem for the presence or absence of haemonchus contortus and the result revealed that 157 ( 40.9% ) were positive .
similarly , the prevalence of the parasite in sheep having different body condition indicated that there is significance difference of the parasite higher in medium body condition animals with the rate of 27.3% compared to good body condition sheep having the rate of 13.5% ( table 1 ) .
based on the current finding , the following points were recommended.the strategic deworming should focus on young and poor and medium body condition sheep.improvement of husbandry practices is very important.continuous surveillance of the parasite in sheep farm is essential.further study on the possible risk factors should be conducted .
generally , the occurrence of the parasite among the sheep of the study site might be associated with the level of immunity of the animals as most of the young animals and those medium body conditions having low immune status are affected .
