however , the bony marginotomy can be associated with longer operative time , increased postoperative pain , recovery time , temporalis muscle wasting , and external scar . using modern imaging modalities in conjunction with minimal incision surgical techniques , we have found that bony marginotomy is rarely needed in order to access presumed benign tumors of the middle and deep orbit . in this study , we present our surgical experience in the removal of orbital tumors using a combination of soft - tissue approaches , without bony marginotomy , under monitored local anesthesia and general anesthesia .
two patients ( # 16&29 ) had mild decrease in visual acuity at the last follow - up , which was related to ocular surface changes .
in this retrospective case series , electronic medical records of all patients with orbital tumors removed through the oculoplastics clinic of the jules stein eye institute between 1992 and 2013 were reviewed .
, many benign orbital tumors can be safely approached through a minimally invasive soft - tissue approach , avoiding a bony marginotomy .
twenty - nine ( out of 30 ) tumors were located in the posterior half of the orbit .
