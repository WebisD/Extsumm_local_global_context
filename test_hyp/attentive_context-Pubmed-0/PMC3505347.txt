oligodendroglioma cells are detectablein the cerebrospinal fluid in up to 14% of patients , and we recently treated a case of multiple anaplastic oligodendrogliomas , describe the case in detail and discuss the distinction between  multicentric  and  dissemination via cerebrospinal pathways  and the treatment .
although , the incidence of multicentricglioma accounts nearly 2.5% of all gliomas , mostcases are glioblastoma or anaplastic gliomas .
various imaging techniques including mr spectroscopy havebeen studied but neither has been found to be powerful to identify pseudoprogression , and unfortunately , the diagnosis of pseudoprogression still depends on pathologicexamination.the disruption of blood - brain barrier with the resultant observation of an earlyradiologic increase in contrast enhancement at mri , which may falsely mimic trueprogression , and this fact made the treatment of this case more complicated .
finally , the tumor in the left paraventricular region showed progression even just after the temozolomide treatment , and we presumed it was pseudoprogression , because in the first 6 months of post - chemoradiotherapy period , showed a high incidence of pathologically confirmed pseudoprogression associated with treatment - related necrosiswithout viable tumor cells .
a 72-year - oldman revealed aphasia , abnormal behavior , and rapidly progressivedementia since october 13 , 2009 , and hospitalized in our department on oct .
