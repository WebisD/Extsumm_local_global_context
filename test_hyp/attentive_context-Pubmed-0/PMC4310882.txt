egyptian men with prostate cancer have a markedly high psa density and gleason grade at diagnosis .
the surveillance group had 65% of cases with a value < 0.425 , while the symptomatic group had 46% of patients with values < 0.425 ( p 0.01 ) .
it was clear that patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in egypt , regardless of their mode of presentation and whether screened or not , tend to have a high serum total psa , psa density , abnormal findings on dre and higher gleason grade , reflecting the aggressive nature of prostate cancer in the egyptian population ( using the western definitions ) .
the aim of our work was to report the pattern of prostate cancer presentation in alexandria university that as a tertiary referral center , provides care for uro  oncology cases .
our reports confirm that egyptian men with prostate cancer had higher psa , psa density and higher gleason grade at initial diagnosis and tailored risk stratification may be needed to allow proper management for our cases .
would mean that nearly all of our cases already had a metastatic and advanced disease , while really only 11% of them had metastatic deposits .
