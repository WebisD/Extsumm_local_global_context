it can be inferred from the findings that andrographis paniculata , abrus precatorius , canthium parviflorum , and costus speciosus possess ability to inhibit oxidation of biological substrates , by virtue of the presence of flavonoid and polyphenols .
the polyphenol content in two extracts of anp ( aq and me ) was higher than in cp and cs , while the polyphenols in 80 me of cp and cs was higher than anp .
the antioxidative ability of various solvent extracts of these four plants to prevent oxidative damage against fenton 's reagent induced peroxidation in human erythrocytes and rat liver microsomes were explored .
studies also report that they exhibit good antioxidant activity in vitro   table 1 depicts the phytochemical composition of the samples , where it was observed that cs and anp were good sources of polyphenols , glutathione , -carotene , total saponins , and steroidal saponins , whereas ap and cp were found to be good sources of flavonoids , alkaloids , -tocopherol , vitamin c , and tannins .
in general , all the extracts of the samples were found to be fair sources ofpolyphenol and flavonoids ; however , it was high in the extracts of ap .
