hence , this study was undertaken to study the effects of two soft drinks ( coca - cola and mirinda orange ) on the shear bond strength ( sbs ) of brackets and their effect on intact and sealed enamel by means of sem .
group i ( sbs , n = 60)group ii ( sem analysis with intact enamel [ ie ] , n = 30)group iii ( sem analysis with etched and sealed enamel , n = 30 ) . 
 
group i ( sbs , n = 60 ) group ii ( sem analysis with intact enamel [ ie ] , n = 30 ) group iii ( sem analysis with etched and sealed enamel , n = 30 ) .
the lowest mean resistance to shearing forces was shown by mirinda orange group ( 5.30  2.74 mpa ) followed by coca - cola group ( 6.24  1.59 mpa ) and highest resistance to shearing forces was by the control group , i.e. , artificial saliva ( 7.33  1.72 mpa ) . in this study
group ii ( ie ) intact enamel weibull survival analysis showed maximum probability failure of 75 % in group ib [ coca- cola ] and group ic [ mirinda orange ] and a minimum probability failure of 40% in group ia [ control ] .
