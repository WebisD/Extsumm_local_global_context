postoperative diffusion mri revealed cerebellar infarction ; however , the patient showed no clinical symptom and was able to discharge with alert mentality , recovered from hemiparesis after rehabilitation ( fig .
the diffusion mri , which was done one year prior to the time of stroke , showed multiple cerebral infarctions on both cerebellum and body of corpus callosum ( fig .
dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial posterior circulation are also rare that produce acute brain stem infarction or hemorrhage in young , healthy patients13,28,29 ) .
when the dissection involves the subadventitia and rupture into the subarachnoid space , sah is presented2,21,24,26,29 ) .
