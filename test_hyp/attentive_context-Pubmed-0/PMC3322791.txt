after bnvv was described and its putative etiologic agent was identified , several sporadic cases were diagnosed on other farms , indicating that it might be underdiagnosed , and further studies of the syndrome may be warranted .
since p. levii was isolated from all bnvv cases and very few healthy cows , it likely caused the lesions .
all the cases observed during this outbreak occurred in primiparous cows in a restricted geographic area ( within a radius of 20 km ) during a limited period of time , indicating that one or more risk factors , alone or in conjunction , predisposed cows to infection .
outbreaks were observed after a large number of cattle were introduced , affecting primarily the animals introduced into the host farm .
the herd comprised approximately 550 dairy cows of the israeli - holstein breed raised in a zero - grazing management system .
moreover , lesions of the genital tract caused by calving tend to be more severe in primiparous cows , thus making them more prone to infection .
transportation and social conflict may have acted as stressors ( with stress immunosuppressive effects ) ( 14 ) and predisposed the introduced cows to infection , with only social conflict affecting the local cattle .
