insulin resistance and vitamin d deficiency in asian - indian children and adolescents , we sought to examine the relationship between vitamin d status and insulin resistance .
we also sought to determine if puberty affected the relationship of vitamin d status and parameters of insulin resistance and sensitivity in asian - indian children and adolescents .
, our study demonstrates a significant inverse relationship in obese asian - indian children between body fat indices and serum 25(oh)d concentrations which persists even after adjustment of covariates .
the association between serum 25(oh)d and parameters of insulin sensitivity and resistance is influenced by puberty as a significant association was found between these two variables in postpubertal subjects ( tanner stage 5 ) only which remained significant even after adjustment for covariates . as association is not equal to causation , future longitudinal research studies are required in determining role of puberty on association between serum 25(oh)d and insulin resistance in both , obese as well as subjects with normal bmi .
serum 25(oh)d also showed significant inverse relationship with fasting serum insulin levels ( r = 0.44 , p = 0.034 ) which improved after adjusting for age , sex , and bmi ( r = 0.53 , p = 0.016 ) .
