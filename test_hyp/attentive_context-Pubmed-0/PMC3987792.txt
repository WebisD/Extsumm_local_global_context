the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between obesity , measures of body fat content , and serum tnf- , il-6 , and il-10 in csle .
serum tnf- ( p = 0.004 ) , il-6 ( p = 0.002 ) , and il-10 ( p < 0.001 ) levels were significantly increased in csle patients when compared to healthy controls ( table 2 ) .
we observed higher serum tnf- levels in obese csle patients when compared with nonobese csle patients ( p = 0.036 ) , obese controls ( p = 0.039 ) and non - obese controls ( p < 0.0001 ) ( table 3 ) .
although these cytokines have been shown to be associated with cvd in other populations , we only observed an association between serum tnf- levels and obesity , and pbf and total fat mass in trunk region .
no difference in serum tnf- levels was observed between obese and non - obese healthy controls ( p > 0.05 ) .
adipose tissue is known to be capable of secreting cytokines such as tnf- , il-6 , and il-10 . therefore , the purpose of this study was to assess whether the levels of these cytokines were increased in obese csle when compared to nonobese csle and healthy controls .
