gbs mimicking brain death usually has a poor recovery rate and a high mortality , particularly in relation to dysautonomia.9 the timely application of combination pulse therapy with both ivig and methylprednisolone might improve the prognosis of fulminant gbs . in summary , in rare cases gbs presents with signs of coma and absent brainstem reflexes .
a 32-year - old man was transferred to an intensive care unit ( icu ) due to respiration difficulties from a hepatology ward where he had been admitted after a 7-day history of symptoms of acute viral hepatitis a ( ha ) and a 3-day history of progressive distal and proximal weakness of limbs with additional facial weakness .
cases exhibiting an association between gbs and ha are extremely rare.1 the reported clinical features of nine reviewed cases of gbs following ha were as follows : ( 1 ) a uniformly good outcome of the neuropathic symptoms , independent of the level of alt , which corresponds to the severity of liver dysfunction ; ( 2 ) highest occurrence in men ; and ( 3 ) the interval between the onset of the hepatitis and the development of neuropathic symptoms is less than 14 days.2 the hsv infection in our patient , in spite of neither symptoms nor signs , might have aggravated the severity of gbs .
