recently , some studies showed that hac level is linked to dn , hats and hdacs also participate in the pathogenesis of dn , and the research regarding hac and the covalent enzymes is not enough to yield a clear picture about dn so far . in this review , we describe some progress associated with the molecular mechanism underlying dn , with specific emphasis on hac and acetylation on nonhistone proteins as important regulators of gene expression in renal cell under diabetic conditions ; the regulators of hac such as hats as well as hdacs in the development and progression of dn ; the inhibitors of hats / hdacs in the dn pathogenesis and their therapeutic potentials for dn .
dn is one of the most serious diabetic microvascular complications and the leading cause of end - stage renal diseases ( esrd ) ; it brings about heavy social and economic burden worldwide , particularly in the developed countries .
global acetylation alterations have been seen in a lot of human diseases including cancer and nervous system diseases , whereas the roles of hac in the pathogenesis of dn are rarely mentioned .
emerging evidences suggest that multiple signaling pathways activations and key transcription factors ( tfs ) are associated with the pathophysiology of dn , which could be influenced by epigenetically regulated mechanisms in chromatin ( histones form a complex structure with dna ) , including dna methylation , posttranslational modifications ( ptms ) , and noncoding rnas ( ncrna ) , which can modulate gene expression in the cell - type - specific pattern .
