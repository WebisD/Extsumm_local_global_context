we report on a large right middle cerebral artery ( mca ) aneurysm , which induced subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) after rupture and showed spontaneous occlusion after a wrapping operation . the characteristics and causes of the aneurysm and possible spontaneous cure
the authors report on a case of spontaneous occlusion and absorption of a saccular aneurysm of mca bifurcation .
many studies on unruptured aneurysms have reported a prevalence of approximately 3.6 to 6% and a bleeding rate of approximately 2.3 to 0.3%/year.1)18 ) for the giant aneurysm (  25 mm ) , a rupture rate of 6% has been reported for one year since the first diagnosis , and based on the natural history , it was considered bad due to high lethality.1)15)20 ) however , with technological developments in the fields of surgery and anesthetics since the 1970s-1980s , the mortality and morbidity associated with the operation have shown a rapid decrease .
it was assumed that in the pathophysiology of spontaneous occlusion of an aneurysm , sluggish flow in the aneurysm may be the cause and the volume - to - orifice ratio of the angiography , slow filling , and delayed excretion through prediction of slow flow may manifest . in cases of inoperable aneurysm ,
