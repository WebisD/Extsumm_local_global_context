numbers of live born and healthy babies were higher in the lmwh group ( table 4 ) . in both groups , two babies had low birth weights of 2.1 kg and 2.4 kg , but were otherwise healthy . in the cmd group , one baby had hydrocephalus . however , the frequency of fetal loss including therapeutic abortion and stillbirth were significantly higher in the cmd group .
prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis occurred in three pregnancies , two in the lmwh group and one in the cmd group ( table 3 ) .
frequencies of maternal thromboembolism were not different between the two groups ( table 2 ) . a maternal transient ischemic attack ( tia ) occurred in one case in each group , and both patients had previously undergone mitral valve replacement .
