the purpose of this article is to review and compare radiation doses from ii and fpd - based systems in interventional cardiology in a tertiary referral center that has introduced fpd system recently .
the dose area product ( dap ) values for coronary angiography ( cag , n = 222 ) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca , n = 75 ) procedures performed during a one year period 20122013 were prospectively recorded using a built - in calibrated dap meter ( transmission ionization chamber ) .
though radiation doses for cardiological interventions from fpd were similar to the ii - based system achieved after optimization , the advantages of fpd in terms of good image uniformity , improved patient imaging accessibility due to smaller size , absence of geometric distortion / veiling glare or vignetting make the fpd superior to the ii systems . to achieve improved patient dose reduction , it is advisable to strictly adhere to low dose protocols with high filtration in fpd systems .
the arithmetic mean dap and fluoroscopic time duration using ii system as reported in literature was 39 gycm for 6.6 min and 61.2 gycm for 17 min for cag and ptca respectively [ table 2 ] . with the use of fpd ,
