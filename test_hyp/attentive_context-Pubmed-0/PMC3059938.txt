alternatively , enteric microbes may enhance disease pathogenesis at the cellular and molecular level via pro - inflammatory mechanisms ( table 1 ) .
realistically , enteric microbiota are a continuum , with members existing somewhere along the spectrum between symbiosis and pathogenicity . as the microbiota co - evolved with humans , they have provided us with genetic and metabolic characteristics that we have not had to develop on our own , such as enabling us to be able to harvest otherwise inaccessible nutrients and synthesizing vitamins ( o'keefe et al . , 2009 ) .
in health , the microbiota prevents overgrowth with pathogens and simultaneously educates the gut immune system in immunotolerance and defense .
the distal intestine is populated by a stunning quantity of bacteria , comprised of relatively few phyla that are highly diverse at the species level . this heterogeneous composition presents a vibrant metabolically active life - form , sharing the same habitat as our enteric organs .
enteric organisms share a common environment with the mucosa and have evolved in tandem to ensure survival of what has been described as the  superorganism . 
resistant starch and non - starch polysaccharides that evade human digestion provide energy for commensal bacteria . in turn , microbes metabolize these undigested nutrients to produce short - chain fatty acids ( scfa ) , including butyrate , the primary nourishment for colonocytes which possesses potent anti - proliferative and anti - inflammatory properties ( pryde et al . , 2002 ) .
