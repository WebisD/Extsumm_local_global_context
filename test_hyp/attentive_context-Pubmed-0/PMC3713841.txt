this case emphasizes the usefulness of azithromycin as a first - line treatment for tularemia in pregnant women in areas where infections caused by biovar 2 strains of f. tularensis subsp .
in late february 2006 , a 27-year - old pregnant woman , at 6 weeks gestation , was referred to grenoble university hospital , grenoble , france , for investigation of persistent left cervical lymphadenopathy with fever .
our patient s symptoms were fever , pharyngitis , and cervical lymphadenopathy ; treatment with a -lactam drug did not improve her condition , which rapidly evolved to local suppuration , a sign that should prompt physicians to consider oropharyngeal tularemia in disease - endemic regions . because tularemia cases remain extremely rare in the french alps , where the patient lived , this diagnosis was not considered at the time of the first medical consultation .   because the rabbit meat was not consumed by the patient , we suspected she became infected at the time she skinned these animals
clinical symptoms of tularemia are primarily related to the portal of entry of bacteria , the f. tularensis strain virulence , and the immune status of the patient .
could be a risk for a pregnant woman or her fetus ; the role of f. tularensis as an agent of abortion and intrauterine death is well recognized in sheep ( 10 ) but not in pregnant women .
