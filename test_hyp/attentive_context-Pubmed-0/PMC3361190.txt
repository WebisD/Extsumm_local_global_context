we present here , for the first time in the international literature , a comparative investigation of literature d , c , n , and o nmr and crystallographic data in order to provide a coherent hydration model of amino acids and selected derivatives at different ionization states in aqueous solution and in the crystal state .
the hydration of amino acids and their derivatives at a molecular level , therefore , is of great importance and has been extensively studied with x - ray crystallography   and a variety of spectroscopic techniques including multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy   , ir and raman spectroscopy   , icr mass spectrometry , and laser ablation in combination with microwave spectroscopy .
investigation of the structural and functional role of water molecules , bound to proteins and peptides , requires a sufficient understanding of the hydration process of their building blocks   .
even though statistical analysis of structural parameters in crystals can not be used in a straightforward way to derive quantitative structural models in solution , it is of interest to note that this mode of six - membered conjugated ring , which is absent in the case of the carboxylic group , might result in a more compact and , thus , less hydrated structure in aqueous solution , in accordance with the nmr data ( figure 8) .
