potential molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol - induced er stress in major organs including liver , brain , pancreas , lung , and heart have been discussed previously   . in this review , i will focus on updates and new insights into the pathogenesis of alcohol - induced er stress and discuss an emerging role of alcohol - induced er stress in liver tumorigenesis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis .
increasing evidence supports er stress as a key mechanism in alcohol - induced liver disease ( ald ) , a disease that affects over 140 million people worldwide .

 the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) is an essential organelle of eukaryotic cells functioning in secretory protein synthesis and processing , lipid synthesis , calcium storage / release , and detoxification of drugs .
molecular chaperones such as the glucose - regulated protein 78 ( grp78/bip ) interact with three er membrane resident stress sensors : inositol - requiring enzyme-1 ( ire1 ) , transcription factor-6 ( atf6 ) , and pkr - like eukaryotic initiation factor 2 kinase ( perk ) , and play a vital role in maintaining the protein homeostasis inside the er   .
alcohol - induced hepatic er stress occurs in the liver of many species including human alcoholics , which has recently been established as an important mechanism for both acute and chronic alcohol - induced liver pathogenesis and disease development .
