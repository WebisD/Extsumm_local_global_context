the viability of using isolated microorganisms for effective biodegradation of pome has been investigated in this study and it can be deduced that the digestion of pome samples based on local isolated fungi and bacteria . this result indicates the potential of isolating of indigenous microorganism that will be effective in the degradation pome ; on the other hand , the isolated microorganism requires nutrient expansion for the effective biodegradation of pome . due to the high concentrations of bod and cod in the oil palm processing effluents , discharging it into the environment could cause pollution ; hence , it is preferable to recycle rather than discharging it . by improving environmental condition of living microorganisms in a biodegradation process
the synergistic effect of bacteria and fungi , for pome treatment , brings about enhanced performance for effective biodegradation .
environmental issues have been gradually increased to becoming one of the most important in economic activities . in addition , the physicochemical conditions of pome from palm oil mills was studied . the following parameters : ph , admi , bod , and cod ,
the addition of functional inoculum and selected high effective indigenous microorganisms is expected to save the pome degradation time and cost for reduction of bod , cod , and color .
