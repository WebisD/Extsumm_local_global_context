congenital heart disease ( chd ) is one of the most common birth defects , with an incidence of nine out of every 1,000 live births.1,2 critical chd ( cchd ) is defined as cardiac lesions that require surgery or cardiac catheterization within the first month ( or within the first year by different definitions ) of life to prevent death or severe end - organ damage.2 although infant mortality has decreased over the past 3 decades for children with all forms of chd , many children are still diagnosed too late to avoid significant morbidity or death.35 delayed diagnosis of cchd is unfortunately all too common , with up to 25% of infants with these defects being missed in newborns when identification is based on clinical symptoms or signs of heart disease even in settings with routine prenatal sonograms.3,68 approximately 40% of these infants with missed diagnoses at birth present in cardiogenic shock at a medical facility and 5% are diagnosed at autopsy.4,5,9 studies in europe and the us have suggested that newborn screening with pulse oximetry testing prior to discharge from the nursery can decrease the number of missed diagnoses by 30%.2,10 in 2011 , pulse oximetry screening for cchd was added to the recommended uniform screening panel by the health and human services secretary.11 in the subsequent years , many states have implemented their own protocols to comply with this recommendation.1215 pulse oximetry has been the mainstay procedure for indirectly detecting hypoxemia in medically ill patients since the 1980s.16,17 the screening of cchd by pulse oximetry involves taking advantage of its ability to detect clinical and more importantly subclinical levels of hypoxemia that should raise suspicion for a cchd .
