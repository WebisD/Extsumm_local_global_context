these cells are now more fully appreciated in their role as heterogeneous and dynamic homeostatic and facilitator signaling cells of the central nervous system ( cns ) .
however , by starting with a firm understanding of the structure and function of the ecm and then appreciating the basic cellular dynamics that limit repair and recovery , the ultimate goal of identifying translatable therapeutic approaches that address the highly heterogeneous repair needs of different brain and spinal cord injuries is certainly achievable .
glial cells were once thought to serve as a passive scaffolding to provide support for the electrically active neurons of the brain and spinal cord .
together with neurons , glial cells also contribute to the supportive structure of the nervous system as they produce and assemble a highly organized extracellular matrix ( ecm ) with adhesive and charge characteristics that enable a wide array of efficiencies in function .
the result of the protective glial response to inflammation associated with trauma in the cns is the formation of a structural and chemical barrier that inhibits synaptic plasticity and axonal growth , both of which will be essential for neurological repair . in the last decade , great strides have been made in understanding the dual roles of the glial response and the nature of the ecm changes following injury .
