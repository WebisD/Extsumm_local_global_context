this is the first case of entirely suprasellar rcc presenting in a child with cryptorchidism to be reported from world literature .
here , we report a rare case of entirely suprasellar rathke 's cleft cyst ( rcc ) in a 4.5-year old child causing hypopituitarism , who presented to us with bilateral cryptorchidism .
in conclusion , rccs are usually intrasellar or combined intra- and suprasellar , can rarely occur in an entirely suprasellar location with intact diaphragm and intact sella turcica , but a presentation as in our case , with features of hypopituitarism at such a young age , is distinctly uncommon . in the evaluation of cryptorchidism
one should explore the possibility of central causes in the etiology , as this may respond to medical therapy , thereby obviating the need for unnecessary surgical intervention .
cryptorchidism , defined as the absence of at least one testis in the scrotum , is a frequent condition in the pediatric population .
cryptorchidism occurs more commonly among patients with congenital disorders of testosterone secretion or action , secondary hypogonadism , testosterone biosynthetic defects , or insensitivity syndromes , abdominal wall defects , neural tube defects , cerebral palsy , and various genetic syndromes ( e.g. , trisomy 18 , trisomy 13 , noonan syndrome , prader - willi syndrome , and laurence - moon - biedl syndrome ) .
