similarly , the its2 sequences of the two h. contortus isolates showed 8 nucleotide variations , including 6 nucleotide substitutions and 2 nucleotide insertions / deletions . in the case of t. circumcincta
overall , the highest similarity in the its1 sequences was detected among t. circumcincta and m. marshalli ( 94% ) and the lowest between n. oiratianus and h. contortus ( africa ) ( 67%).the iranian and uk t. circumcincta and t. colubriformis its1 sequences were 100% identical .
the objective was to compare the its1 , its2 and igs regions of these nematodes in order to choose best target for specific identification methods .
both the its1 and its2 sequences are convenient targets for the species - specific identification of iranian bursate nematodes . due to some sequence variations that may occur between geographically different isolates ( of the same species ) , it is advisable to obtain sequences from local isolates before design of specific identification methods .
the highest similarity among the genera overall was detected between t. circumcincta and m. marshalli ( 88% ) and the lowest similarity was between n. oiratianus and h. contortus ( africa ) ( 64% ) .
a high similarity was found between t. colubriformis and m. marshalli ( 99% ) and low similarity between t. circumcincta ( uk ) and all other species .
