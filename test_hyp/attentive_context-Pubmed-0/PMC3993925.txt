optical methods 
 ( uv  vis absorption and circular dichroism ( cd ) spectrometry ) 
 and nmr were used in tandem with the two - layer oniom method to investigate 
 the effect of ph on the structures of two different pb 
the differences in the coordination chemistry of the metal 
 centers and the protein structures at various ph were deciphered . 

we also investigated the chemical stabilities and structural flexibility 
 of these two complexes in proteolytic processing to gain insight into 
 the lead detoxification process involving mts .
specifically , mt2 reduces the pb - inflicted toxicity by seizing free pb in the 
 cellular milieu or by sequestering pb from pb - inflicted proteins .
the structural conversion 
 from pb7mt2(i ) to pb7mt2(ii ) 
 is likely to occur in the acidic environment of lysosome , facilitating 
 the effective detoxification and metabolism of pb .
the similar structural , chemical , and biological properties 
 between rabbit liver pb7mt2(ii ) and human pb7mt2(ii ) suggest a commonality in the pb coordination chemistry among mammalian mt2s .
in this work , the ph - dependent coordination chemistry between pb and mt2 was systematically studied .
the higher acid tolerance , 
 greater coordination stability , and faster degradation rate of pb7mt2(ii ) have significant implications for the pb detoxification process .
