is often inferred from the anion gap ( ag ) , calculated as [ na ] + [ k ] - ( [ cl ] + [ hco3 ] ) . when its reference range is exceeded , a search for unmeasured anions should commence , irrespective of the overall metabolic acid - base status , because a competing metabolic alkalosis can mask their presence .
since the late 1960s reports have emerged of accumulating tca cycle intermediates in shock and dysoxic states . the pattern reported by forni and colleagues   in human metabolic acidosis differed substantially from the findings reported by bruegger and coworkers , with relatively small increases in isocitrate , -ketoglutarate , malate and d - lactate , and in some cases citrate and succinate . only on aggregate were these sufficient to inflate the ag .
reports of increased tricyclic acid ( tca ) cycle anions in shock are now emerging . their presence
likely culprits vary with the clinical scenario , but the search usually starts with l - lactate and -hydroxybutyrate . during this process , stoichiometry is tracked between ag ( measured ag  normal ag ) and the summed concentrations of suspect anions ( always in meq / l , because we are dealing in electrical neutrality ) . if ag
