, we describe a case of hemorrhagic shock caused by a huge hematoma after insertion of a cvc without apparent arterial puncture in a patient on anticoagulation therapy .
reported that hemorrhagic shock is associated with a huge hematoma after catheterization in patients with anticoagulant therapy . in our case
a 74-year - old man with diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , hypertension ( htn ) , and atrial fibrillation ( af ) presented to the emergency room with sudden onset of left leg pain due to superficial femoral artery ( sfa ) thrombosis . soon after arrival , he was scheduled to undergo emergency thrombectomy .
additionally , it might be helpful to prevent complications by choosing a proper site of insertion and ultrasound - guided technique .
however , administration of heparin during the intraoperative and postoperative period might also be linked closely to the formation of a huge hematoma , especially if vessel injury occurs during insertion of cvc . in conclusion , it is often difficult to detect serious complication such as concealed hematoma after central venous catheterization . therefore , when insertion of a cvc is performed in patients requiring anticoagulant therapy , the possibility of massive bleeding must be considered and particular attention must be given to the care of such patients .
