a 76-year - old man visited our hospital ( asan medical center , seoul , korea ) with a mass on his right breast first being recognized two months ago .
the patient received immunochemotherapy ( r - chop ) and prophylactic radiotherapy to the contralateral testis because of the high relapse rate of testicular lymphoma . in summary ,
