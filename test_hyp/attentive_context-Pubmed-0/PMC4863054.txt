a 78-year - old man was referred to our emergency department with a 3-day history of diarrhea and fever .
further , we present a review of the literature regarding the association between vascular events and cmv infection in immunocompetent patients .
we report a case of acute cmv colitis in an immunocompetent adult that was complicated by vascular thrombosis and pulmonary embolism .
acute cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) infection is common in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients worldwide.12 the infection is often asymptomatic .
this is the first report of an immunocompetent patient with acute cmv colitis complicated by vascular thrombosis with pulmonary embolism in which no other obvious underlying predisposing factor for thrombosis was identified .
a chest radiograph obtained post - intubation revealed an engorged main pulmonary trunk with an abrupt cutoff of pulmonary vascularity in the distal portions bilaterally , indicative of the " westermark sign " ( fig .
advanced age , male gender , presence of immune - modulating comorbidities , and need for surgical intervention all negatively influence survival.13 although the cost - effectiveness of investigating for acute cmv infection in patients presenting with thrombosis has not yet been established , we believe that serum samples for cmv infection should be obtained and endoscopic examination should be considered in patients with idiopathic thrombosis . in conclusion , although pulmonary embolism caused by acute cmv colitis in immunocompetent patients is extremely rare , it should be considered in patients who present with severe respiratory symptoms . to the best of our knowledge ,
