considering frequency of hirsutism and failure to study prolactin ( prl ) level in patients , the performance of this study about hirsutism causes can help confront with the hirsute patients to find the main cause and determine a suitable solution for patients .
considering the importance of hyperprolactinemia as one of the causes of infertility and unawareness of patients with hirsutism , the hirsute patients particularly those with a positive family record of hirsutism are recommended to inform the physician and necessary studies should be conducted in this regard .
hyperprolactinemia was found in two patients with galactorrhoea ( 8% ) , three patients with androgenic alopecia ( 12% ) , five patients with androgenic alopecia ( 12% ) , five patients with the history of ovary cyst ( 20% ) , one patient receiving drug for infertility ( among 115 married women ) , and 15 patients with positive family history of hirsutism .
in our study , despite the exclusion of patients with pco , the prevalence of hyperprolactinemia was high .
measurement of dhea - s level showed that 18 patients ( 9% ) had a serum level more than 340 g / ml , and there was hyperprolactinemia in two patients .
