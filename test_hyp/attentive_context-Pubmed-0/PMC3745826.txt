we studied the contribution of action  effect cue integration to the perception of action and its sensory outcome in intentional binding . according to the cue integration hypothesis , the compression in the perceived temporal interval between a voluntary action and its sensory consequence results from using both events as temporally informative cues .
based on each subject s individual auditory detection threshold , we generated three tones with increasing intensities , which in the presence of noise provided high , intermediate and low levels of uncertainty in the perception of tone onset .
2002 ) and prior expectations ( krding and wolpert 2004 ) , in order to reduce variability in performance ( e.g. , ernst and banks 2002 ) . in binding , the action event and the sensory outcome event ( tone ) provide two separate cues for estimating their time .
finally , in conditions where both action and tone cues are provided , the variability of time estimates should be lower ( i.e. , time estimates should be more precise ) than in conditions where only one cue is provided , reflecting the key behavioral advantage of cue integration for perceptual precision .
the cue integration hypothesis also predicted an increase in the shift of the perception of the sensory outcome toward the action with increasing uncertainty ( i.e. , increased tone binding ) .
