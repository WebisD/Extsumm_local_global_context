purpose of this review is to outline a new panorama of osteoimmunology that is not limited to immune mediated bone turnover but also consider , in the light of the latest findings in this field , interesting connections with other systems and regulatory functions over bone remodeling .
researchers recently hav - egained better understanding of the dialogue between immune and bone cells and a new reading register of bone remodeling is emerging , in which the various phases of bone formation and resorption , that coexist in a dynamic equilibrium , are under strict immunological control .
bone is a dynamic tissue formed by a protein and mineral salt matrix in which are embedded the bone cells , osteocytes ( ocy ) , osteoblasts ( ob ) and osteoclasts ( oc ) . in addition , many other types of cells take part in bone composition , including cartilage , stromal , hematopoietic and mesenchimal stem cells , all linked by a dense network of signals .
its fields of interest are constantly expanding , thus enriching with an increasing number of translational implications , even in clinical practice and in various branches of medicine . here , the most important concepts in osteoimmunology are addressed in the context of physiopatological states bridging these two organ systems , including osteoporosis , ageing , menopause , inflammatory arthritis , cancer , dysmetabolism and neurological disorders .
