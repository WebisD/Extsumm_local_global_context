the activated mg and the molecular axes mediating their response to the niche , aided by reproducible animal models and lineage reporters , a pharmacological recruitment of these endogenous progenitors for therapeutic regeneration is a near possibility . in addition , information emerging from these studies will help us understand how the neurogenic potential in the adult mammalian brain is constrained relative to that of lower vertebrates , currently a significant knowledge gap .
the discipline of mg - based regeneration is a recent one , particularly in mammals . with information on the nature of
recent progress in our understanding of brain development has significantly altered concepts for treating neurodegenerative diseases , including those that affect the retina to cause blindness .
contrary to previous thought , it is now recognized that neurons are generated in the sub ventricular zone ( svz ) of the lateral ventricle , and the sub - granular zone ( sgz ) in the hippocampus from neural stem cells ( nsc ) of glial origin throughout life ( 1 ) . outside these discrete regions in the mammalian cns , including the retina , active neurogenesis has not been reproducibly demonstrated under normal conditions ( 2 ) .
