in conclusion , we demonstrated for the first time that soluble hla - ib molecules hla - g and hla - e are present in bm plasma samples in physiological and pathological conditions , and their concentration correlated with stage disease in nb patients .
the prognostic value of shla - g and shla - e concentration in bm plasma samples from nb patients at diagnosis has to be confirmed in future studies .
analysis of these patients at follow - up will reveal whether shla - g and shla - e concentration in bm plasma may predict the clinical outcome of nb patients .
we demonstrated for the first time that shla - g and shla - e are present also in bm plasma samples derived from either nb patients at diagnosis or healthy donors . moreover , we have assessed that shla - g and shla - e levels in bm plasma samples are related to the stage of the disease .
the strong correlation observed between the levels of these two molecules in bm samples either from nb patients or controls suggested that both molecules may be released by the same cell populations , or at least induced by similar stimuli . we have previously demonstrated that metastatic nb cells in the bm expressed high levels of hla - g on their surface , in contrast with primary tumors , that tested negative for hla - g .
