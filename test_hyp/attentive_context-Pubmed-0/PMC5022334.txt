the mean total operative time of the robotic group was longer than that of conventional open approach group ( 118.8  16.5 min vs. 90.7  10.3 min , p < 0.05 ) .
the aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robotic total thyroidectomy with cnd via bilateral axillo - breast approach ( baba ) , compared to the conventional low - collar incision method for the treatment of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma .
this study found the statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of the vass for pain assessment ( 2.1  1.0 vs. 3.8  1.2 , p < 0.05 ) and nss ( 8.9  0.8 vs. 4.8  1.7 , p < 0.05 ) .
the differences of the two groups in the estimated intraoperative blood loss , postoperative hospital stay time , numbers of lymph node removed , primary tumor sizes , total drain volumes , mean draining days , and number of patients whose tumors showed multicentricity or multifocality were not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) . the complications in both groups , such as hypoparathyroidism ( temporary ) , rln paralysis ( temporary ) , seroma , skin burn , flap necrosis , hematoma , wound infection , chyle leakage , and postoperative tg levels , were not statistically different ( all p > 0.05 ) . among the 100 patients ,
