this project aims to determine whether imaging and compression testing of cancellous bone from the femoral neck can accurately assess the bone s microarchitectural and biomechanical properties , respectively , and if together they will serve as a good index of bone quality .
we have successfully established a protocol that will be used in a trial setting to analyze the bone quality in human femoral necks using ct and biomechanical compression testing . using cores of cancellous bone from human femoral necks , the relative porosity and the bmd
were shown to be excellent predictive markers of fracture resistance . as this trial evolves in its early stages ,
comparable to the bovine samples , the compressive strength and the modulus of the human samples are strongly correlated ( r = 0.99 ) , as demonstrated in figure 2 .
further investigation of the imaging data revealed that the relative porosity , calculated as the complement of the percent bone volume ( i.e. 1 - % bone volume ) , and the bmd were the best predictors of bone quality .
as the effect of bisphosphonates on the femoral neck and surrounding areas has not yet been assessed , we will analyze the bone quality of proximal femurs from treated patients that are discarded after hip replacement surgery . prior to undertake these clinical trials , however , protocols must be established in an untreated population in order to properly assess the quality of bone .
