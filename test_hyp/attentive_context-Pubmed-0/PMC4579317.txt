the aim of the present study was to verify the safety , the clinical efficacy , and the possible benefits of reinfusion of postoperatively collected autologous blood in total knee replacement procedures , with special emphasis on cost - benefit and reinfusion procedure , by comparing autologous blood transfusion with nonautologous blood transfusion .
the tourniquet time was 1.13  0.27 hours in study group versus 1.04  0.27 hours in control group ( p = 0.36 ) . in the study group the mean length of stay at the hospital ( los ) was 7.88  0.7 days , while it was 8.96  2.47 days for the control group ( p = 0.03 ) .
a total knee replacement surgical procedure , along with the complementary use of a device for postoperative collection and reinfusion of shed blood resulted in an average reduction of the length of hospital stay equal to 1.08  0.76 days ( p = 0.03 versus control ) .
between 2011 and 2012 , one hundred twenty - four patients with a mean age of 71.2  6.8 years and a range between 50 and 84 years were included in the study .
reinfusion group patients also displayed a reduction in the length of stay in hospital by 1.08  0.76 days ( p = 0.03 versus control ) .
