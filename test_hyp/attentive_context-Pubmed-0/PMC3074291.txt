repeated bronchoscopic examination after six months from initiating antituberculous treatment revealed complete resolution of the two lesions without residual bronchial stenosis .
our patient was successfully treated with anti - tuberculous chemotherapy without the use of corticosteroids .
we are presenting a case of ebtb that manifested with two endobronchial masses , which almost totally occluded the bronchial lumen and resulted in repeated episodes of post - obstructive pneumonia for more than a year prior to diagnosis .
endobronchial stenosis is a common complication of ebtb despite the use of anti - tuberculous chemotherapy .
considering the prognosis of tumorous type ebtb and the delay in diagnosis as a predictor for the development of bronchial stenosis , healing without stenosis in our case seems interesting .
endobronchial tuberculosis ( ebtb ) is a form of tuberculous infection that involves mainly the trachea and/or bronchi .
a 62 year old pakistani woman was admitted to hamad general hospital with history of fever for 10 days prior to admission .
future research should focus on the pathogenesis of bronchial inflammatory reaction induced by ebtb in order to understand this mechanism .
our patient presented with two tumorous growths that almost completely obstructed the lumens of the right main bronchus and right upper lobe bronchus and resulted in recurrent episodes of post - obstructive pneumonia for more than a year prior to diagnosis .
