therefore , we do not advocate treating pneumonia caused by ls with an oral -lactam antibiotic .
the other case is a severe pneumonia caused by ls in an apparently immunocompetent male patient .
an 81-year - old diabetic male came to our hospital to seek medical attention for 2 weeks of productive cough , fever and chills , and a 10 kg weight loss .
one case is cavitary pneumonia with bacteremia caused by l. buccalis in an immunocompromised host .
thus , the patient continued to be clinically stable while on either pip - tazo or penicillin g. we postulate that the pneumonia recurred while on amoxicillin - clavulanate was likely due to the oral agent at a subtherapeutic level in the lung tissue .
ls is an anaerobic gram - negative bacillus that resides in the oral cavity and usually does not cause disease .
due to the rarity of human infection caused by ls , the duration of treatment for pneumonia caused by this bacterium is not clear . in our case , because the pneumonia recurred after we administered pip - tazo for only 9 days , we aggressively gave the patient 4 weeks of piptazo followed by 2 weeks of intravenous aqueous penicillin g. although there are no clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) breakpoints for ls , penicillins are considered the drugs of choice .
