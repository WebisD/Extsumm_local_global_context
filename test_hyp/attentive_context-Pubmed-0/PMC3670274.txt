in humans , type i interferons are encoded by ~16  genes and individual genes encoding  ,  ,  and . their gene products are highly structurally related and all bind to a single receptor ( ifnar ) consisting of heterodimeric r1 and r2 subunits .
regardless , the survival of each species , including humans , to viral assaults thus depends upon the flexibility of stat2 to maintain distinct physical interactions , which preserve its function in driving the interferon response .
thus , stat2 is central to the induction of these genes in response to both ifn-/ and ifn-. in some cases , type ii interferon , ifn- , can mobilize the antiviral response in a stat2-dependent manner .
, we will explore how stat2 has emerged as a highly divergent member of the stat family while retaining its ability to exclusively regulate the interferon response in each species .
considering the central role that stat2 plays in regulating the intracellular anti - viral response , it represents an important target for viral interference . while speculative , it is likely that lethal pandemic viruses drive stat2 evolution , in some cases , by targeting stat2 directly .
a cascade of cytokines regulate processes of inflammation that drive both local and systemic activation of immune cells , and this process can be initiated by both pathogen sensing as well as sterile tissue injury . when discussing the role of stats in inflammation , it is perhaps more accurate to discuss their function in the context of distinct cytokine receptors , as most of the stat family members can be activated by multiple cytokines .
