loss of histological attachment ( cej - je ) and bone loss ( cej - bc ) ( p < 0.05 ) were statistically different in the animals exposed to alcohol ( gal ) and the ones exposed to alcohol and stress ( gasl ) .
however , nonstressed animals who also consumed alcohol for the same period showed a pattern of periodontal breakdown even more severe .
the most severe periodontal breakdown was observed among the nonstressed animals exposed to alcohol , followed by the group of stressed animals exposed to alcohol .
initially , a research assistant randomly divided the animals in four experimental groups : group gal : alcohol + ligature ( n = 8);group gasl : alcohol + stress + ligature ( n = 8);group gpc : stress + ligature , positive control ( n = 8);group gcn : negative control ( n = 8) .
thirty - two animals of the rattus norvegicus species lewis breed ( two - month old ) , weighing average 250  g , were selected for the present study .
therefore , aiming to confirm or reject this hypothesis we evaluated whether forced alcohol intake by stressed animals affects histometrical parameters of periodontal breakdown .
