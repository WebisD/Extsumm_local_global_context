recent studies have indicated that cervical spondylosis patients with cervical vertigo symptoms could be managed successfully with acdf . in this study , we report 2 cases of cervical spondylosis with concomitant cervical vertigo and hypertension that were treated successfully with acdf .
we report here 2 patients of cervical spondylosis with concomitant cervical vertigo and hypertension that were treated successfully with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion .
case 1 , a 49-year - old female , was admitted with 2 years of history of chronic neck pain , headache , and episodic vertigo and tinnitus .
when patients do not respond to conservative therapy , anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( acdf ) usually is used to achieve neural decompression , maintain cervical lordosis , and provide segmental stabilization . in our practice , it was often found that patients with cervical spondylosis tended to have concomitant cervical vertigo symptoms such as tinnitus , headache , blur vision , and palpitation .
stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibers in pathologically degenerative disc could produce sympathetic excitation , and induce a sympathetic reflex to cause cervical vertigo and hypertension .
cervical spondylosis is a common cause of chronic neck pain , radiculopathy and/or myelopathy resulting in significant disability .
