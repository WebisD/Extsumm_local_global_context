in the previous issue of critical care , chen and colleagues investigate whether hydrocortisone influences the neurological outcome and mortality in a rat model of traumatic brain injury ( tbi)-induced critical illness - related corticosteroid insufficiency ( circi ) . up to 30 to 80% of tbi patients
this may prove important since bombardier and colleagues have shown that 51.3% of patients met the criteria for major depressive disorders during the first year after tbi . in the present study , chen and colleagues nicely demonstrate in a rat model of tbi that treating circi with hydrocortisone improves neurological recovery by blocking neuronal apoptosis , and reducing damage of the tight junction .
the authors postulated that early recognition of circi after tbi and treatment with corticosteroids may improve neurological outcome .
circi : critical illness - related corticosteroid insufficiency ; il : interleukin ; tbi : traumatic brain injury .
the results of a large randomized multicenter study ( corti - tc ) will provide valuable data on the effects of hydrocortisone in severe tbi patients .
circi has been studied in sepsis but received much less attention after tbi , despite the fact that its incidence seems high .
