a 43-year - old man was referred to our center for the endoscopic resection of a nongranular lst ( lst - ng ) in the transverse colon .
in which delayed perforation occurred after performing esd on a laterally spreading tumor ( lst ) in the colon .
this perforation was completely unexpected because there were no esd - associated risk factors for this complication in the patient , and no severe coagulation damage was apparent at the post - esd ulcer base .
however , in the case of thermal injury , the postprocedural ulcer base may demonstrate whitish coagulation damage , and delayed perforation mainly occurs . we here report a case
endoscopists should always keep in mind that perforation can develop even after clean procedures , and should closely evaluate any complaints about unexplained abdominal pain after therapeutic colonoscopy procedures , including polypectomy and esd .
the incidence of perforation is even higher during endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) in the colorectum [ 1 - 3 ] .
thus , we believe the decision to perform emergency surgery was appropriate . therapeutic colonoscopy , which has dramatically evolved in recent years , is an important modality for the treatment of colonic neoplasm .
