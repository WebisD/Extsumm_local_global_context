, this paper used a qualitative research design to unpack the perceptions and experiences of new canadians directly affected by food allergy by addressing the following objectives : ( 1 ) to understand how new canadians perceive food allergies and their associated risks and ( 2 ) to investigate how new canadians manage and cope with food allergies .
these findings indicate that food allergy among new canadians is an important ( and potentially growing ) public health issue deserving of attention , given the reported impacts on social isolation / exclusion and quality of life , as well as the dearth of resources available .
this exploratory research raises several issues deserving of more research : health literacy levels in immigrant populations , the wider variety of allergens that immigrants may be reacting to , and further research to understand the impacts of food allergies in other ethnocultural groups in canada as immigrants represent a large and growing proportion of the canadian population .
researchers are only beginning to find potential links between age of fish intake and allergic disease that may also be the case of shellfish allergy   .
the difference in their level of awareness was evident in discussions that touched on their first allergic experience , the etiology of food allergies , and the lack of policies in their birth place to protect them in public places .
