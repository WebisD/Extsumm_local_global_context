the durable clinical benefits obtained with immune checkpoint blockade have reinvigorated the field of cancer immunotherapy . moving forward ,
however , the proportion of patients developing severe iraes following combination immunotherapies most likely will increase . utilizing relevant preclinical mouse models of cancer that better model tumour
checkpoint blockade looks set to be explored in combination with other therapies to further improve their therapeutic efficacy and their impact on more cancer types .
we now appreciate that the immune system recognizes cancer and that patients with strong natural immune reactions have better survival compared with those with weak responses .
these can include : ( i ) downregulation of antigen and major histocompatibility complex class i ( mhc i ) expression , ( ii ) production of immunosuppressive mediators ( for example , interleukin-10 ( il-10 ) , transforming growth factor- , adenosine , vascular endothelial growth factor - a ( vegf - a ) , indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( ido ) ) to dampen effector cell activation and ( iii ) recruitment of immune cell subsets ( t regulatory cells ( tregs ) and myeloid - derived suppressor cell ( mdsc ) ) to suppress effector immune cell function and facilitate its growth and metastases .
