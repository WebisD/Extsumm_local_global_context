we report the case of an adult woman with psoriatic arthritis who developed acute severe hepatitis following long - term treatment with mtx .
it is one of the most commonly used medicines in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis .
the first case of autoimmune hepatitis associated with mtx was described in 2011 in a 57-year - old man after 11 years of treatment with mtx .
this report confirms the need to monitor liver enzymes carefully in patients with psoriatic arthritis using long - term treatment with mtx .
hepatic fibrosis is a usual adverse reaction reported with long - term use of mtx therapy in psoriatic patients .
mtx was stopped in the year 2005 due to remission of the disease . in 2009 ,
in addition , sufficient and continuous exposure to the drug , lack of previous evidence of autoimmune disease and complete resolution of the condition within 4 months of discontinuation of the suspected drug confirmed the diagnostic criteria of drug - induced autoimmunity .
appearance of autoantibodies and transitory autoimmune disease associated with infliximab in a patient with psoriatic arthritis has also been documented and the preexistent serological signs of autoimmunity are believed to be a risk factor for the development of similar autoimmune reactions .
