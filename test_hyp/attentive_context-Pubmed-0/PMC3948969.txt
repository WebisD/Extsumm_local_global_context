, we reported a case of an asymptomatic congenital - heart defect a five - chambered heart - cor triatriatum , an extremely rare condition .
significant sequel is unusual with cor triatriatum dextrum as it is not commonly associated with life - threatening symptoms or major congenital cardiac defects .
congenital heart defects / diseases contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality in childhood , especially in the third - world countries where facilities for management are often deficient.1 about 35,000 infants ( 1 out of every 125 ) are born with heart defects every year in the united states.2 the incidence in the tropics is not expected to differ from the 8 - 10 per 1000 live - births documented in the developed world.3 the defect may be so slight that the baby may be asymptomatic for many years after birth , or so severe that it is life threatening .
associated bicuspid pulmonary valve , aortic valve atresia and heterotaxy have also been described.9 congenital pulmonary vein stenosis is a very rare association with cor triatriatum.10 the morbidity and mortality of cor triatriatum sinistrum is high in those who are symptomatic in infancy .
heart defects are the leading cause of birth defect - related deaths.4 however ; the use of echocardiography has improved description of congenital heart diseases and their early diagnosis.5 this , has led to dramatic increases in survival of children with serious heart defects .
