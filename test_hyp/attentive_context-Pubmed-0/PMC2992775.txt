the promise for pthrp(1 - 36 ) as a therapeutic agent for diabetes is especially attractive , given that this peptide has been shown to be both safe and effective for the treatment of osteoporosis ( 15,16 ) and that pthrp(1 - 36 ) in the 100 pmol / l range , a concentration that is likely transiently induced in humans treated with tolerable doses of pthrp(1 - 36 ) ( 15,16 ) , is sufficient to enhance human -cell proliferation in vitro .
now , we demonstrate for the first time that cyclin e , both alone and together with cdk2 , significantly enhances human -cell proliferation , suggesting that cyclin e may be one of the limiting factors in proliferation of human -cells .
this study shows that a small amino terminus peptide of pthrp is capable of enhancing both proliferation and function in human -cells in vitro .
thus , pthrp(1 - 36 ) enhances insulin secretion in human islets at both physiological and pathophysiological glucose concentrations . to begin to assess the molecular mechanisms of pthrp - induced human -cell proliferation , we measured expression of the g1/s cell cycle regulators .
understanding the regulation of , and elucidating therapeutic mechanisms to enhance , human -cell proliferation and function is critical for the long - term treatment of diabetes .
