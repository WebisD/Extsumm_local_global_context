the whole set of experiments presented here supports the proposed 
  ph - dependent mechanism of ros generation in mitochondrial respiratory chain 
  and its link with mitochondrial permeability transition .
it allows us to 
  understand the mechanism by which ucps down - regulate the level of ros in 
  cells .

  demonstrates , the loss of membrane potential can be delayed by the presence in 
  the medium of the agents known to inhibit permeability transition pore 
  opening ; cyclosporine a together with adp and oligomycin .
the permeability transition was not observed under conditions 2 and 3 ; 
  however , the alkalization - induced increase of respiration rate when 
   remained constant ( figs . 
 
the authors have shown that the rate of 
  superoxide generation increased in conjunction with an increase of medium ph 
  from 7 to 9.2 in the presence of nadh or succinate as substrates and 
  inhibitors rotenone or antimycin a , respectively .
to study the ph - dependent component in the mechanism of reactive oxygen 
  species generation in mitochondria , we used three types of incubation media 
  with different impacts on the ph and electrical components of proton motive 
  force through the inner membrane : condition 1 , the medium without permeant 
  anions , such as pi ; condition 2 , the medium of condition 1 
  supplemented with pi ; condition 3 , the medium of condition 2 
  supplemented with nigericin .
