by contrast , the reduced levels of cquiobp1 transcripts affected the responses of compounds with higher thresholds , thus allowing us to conclude that cquiobp1 is indeed involved in the detection of oviposition attractants , and that high levels of obps expression are essential for the sensitivity of the insect s olfactory system .
2008 ) . in the present study , we used cquiobp1 as a target in rna interference ( rnai ) experiments to examine its function in the reception of oviposition attractants . mosquitoes injected with double strand rna ( dsrna ) showed reduced levels of cquiobp1 transcripts as well as reduced antennal responses to mop , skatole , and indole when compared to water - injected controls
these findings suggest that cquiobp1 is involved in the detection of multiple oviposition attractants and plays a key role in the sensitivity of the mosquito olfactory system .
we then focused on cquiobp1 , which is highly expressed in the antennae of the southern house mosquito culex pipiens quinquefasciatus ( = cx .
recently , cquiobp1 was shown to bind a mosquito oviposition pheromone ( mop ) ( laurence and pickett 1982 ) in a ph dependent manner and to be expressed in antennal sensilla sensitive to this pheromone ( leal et al .
