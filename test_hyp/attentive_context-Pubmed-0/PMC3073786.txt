a high index of suspicion should be maintained for extraluminal etiologies of obscure bleeding in order to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary endoscopic and surgical interventions in the era of video capsule endoscopy and double balloon enteroscopy .
angiography should ideally be performed at the onset of herald pain in order to detect extravasation of contrast from the splanchnic vessel into the pancreatic duct .
it is important to consider the diagnosis of hemosuccus pancreaticus in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding .
hemosuccus pancreaticus is defined as bleeding from the pancreatic duct , and was first reported by lower and farrell in 1931 . the term 
the most common etiology of this relatively rare entity is communication of a splanchnic artery aneurysm with the pancreatic duct , either due to erosion or fistula formation .
visceral angiography is useful to confirm the site of bleeding and demonstrate a fistula between the pancreatic duct and peripancreatic vessels , with a sensitivity of 67100%   .
other etiologies for hemosuccus pancreaticus include erosion of a pseudocyst into a peripancreatic artery in patients with chronic pancreatitis , direct bleeding from the pancreatic duct as a result of pancreatic duct stones , primary aneurysm of a splenic artery , blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma , mycotic aneurysms , and rarely pancreatic malignancy .
