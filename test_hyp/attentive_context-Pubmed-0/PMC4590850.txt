univariate analysis of hypothesized risk factors of gender ( or = 3.0 ; 95% ci = 1.75.4 ) , increased age ( or = 2.3 ; 95% ci = 1.24.2 ) , husbandry system ( or = 5.1 ; 95% ci = 2.411.2 ) , feed type ( or = 16.9 ; 95% ci = 2.3124.3 ) , no hand washing habit before feeding ( or = 31.5 ; 95% ci = 4.3230.9 ) , not using anthelmintic in pigs ( or = 11.9 ; 95% ci = 5.028.5 ) and owner ( or = 2.5 ; 95% ci = 1.44.4 ) , and pork consumption of owner ( or = 37.4 ;
this prevalence with relatively high percentage of porcine cysticercosis ( 15.93% ) in ab - elisa and 23.67% in slaughtered pigs indicates the presence of human taeniasis and it also leads to the associated risk of human cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis .
therefore , the objectives of this community - based study were to investigate the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis and associated risk factors in pigs within study area . moreover , findings of this study will assist to develop the control strategies of porcine cysticercosis for the public health aspect .
