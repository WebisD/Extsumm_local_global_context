our data also suggested that ctpa is a suitable way to identify the presence of pe in patients with pulmonary embolism and to evaluate the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients with pe .
we therefore performed the current study to investigate the incidence and computed tomography ( ct ) characteristics of pe in a chinese population of patients with pulmonary embolism .
the obstruction index in pulmonary embolism patients without pe ( 15.6  10.9 ) was not different from that in the patients with pe ( 16.6  10.9 ) ( t = 0.921 , p = 0.357 ) .
, we noted in the present study that a chinese population with pulmonary embolism was more likely to have a pe than those without pulmonary embolism , and the incidence of pe in chinese patients with pulmonary embolism was 19.9% , which was significantly higher than that in those without embolism ( 9.4% ) .
concomitant central and peripheral emboli were seen in the majority ( n = 735 , 60.2% ) of patients , peripheral emboli were seen in the remaining patients ( n = 485 , 39.8% ) , and no central clots alone were seen .
types of pulmonary emboli in patients with and without pes  = 0.935 , p = 0.342 .
