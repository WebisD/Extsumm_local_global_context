encouraged by these results , we extracted ffpe mouse liver tissues 
 with heat augmented by elevated hydrostatic pressure , with the goal 
 of reducing extraction bias , improving the recovery of intact proteins , 
 and obtaining tryptic digests that more closely resemble those from 
 matched fresh - frozen tissue .
initial physical studies on tissue surrogates supported this hypothesis and suggested that the effect of pressure was 
 to reduce the size of protein aggregates through increased water penetration , 
 rather than to increase the rate of reversal of protein  formaldehyde 
 adducts and cross - links directly .
virtually all protocols reported in the 
 literature for the extraction 
 of proteins from ffpe tissue use a variation of the heat - induced antigen 
 retrieval technique developed by shi and taylor for the recovery of antigenicity in immunohistochemical 
 studies .
the ability of elevated pressure to significantly 
 improve the recovery of intact proteins from ffpe tissues over the 
 use of heat alone has great potential for broad application to top - down 
 proteomic studies for the identification of disease biomarkers .
further , the tryptic digests of these pressure - extracted 
 tissues resulted in protein profiles that more closely resembled those 
 from matched fresh - frozen tissue when analyzed by lc / ms than did those 
 extracted with heat alone , while maintaining a false - identification 
 rate of < 2% .
