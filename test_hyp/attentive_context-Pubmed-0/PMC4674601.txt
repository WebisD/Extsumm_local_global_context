in conclusion , in agreement with the recurrent observation of high serum ige levels and presence of eosinophils , plasmocytes , and ige in the liver of aih-1 pediatric patients , we have identified novel associations with polymorphic variants of the il13 gene and the functionally related il4 receptor alpha chain which suggest ige - linked immune responses may be involved in the overall susceptibility to aih-1 .
we also investigated , in the predominant aih-1 group of patients , functional polymorphisms of the il4 , il13 , il5 , and il4ra ( il4 receptor alpha chain ) genes involved in ige switching and eosinophil differentiation and maturation that we believe might contribute to overall genetic susceptibility to aih .
furthermore , presence of the t allele at il4 rs2227284 has been associated with higher ige levels in white , african - american , and hispanic asthma patients . in the multivariate analysis ( see model 3 ) , the same t allele was significantly associated with serum ige levels strengthening our hypothesis of an additional role for the il4 , il13 cytokine pathway in the pathogenesis of aih .
, we analyzed the major clinical manifestations and biopsies from brazilian children grouped according to the aih type and serum ige levels .
