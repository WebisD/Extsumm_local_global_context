a prospective study of patients with penetrating injuries to the lower thorax and anterior abdomen admitted to the bellevue hospital trauma and shock unit , a level i trauma center in new york city , was performed between september 1995 through november 1997 .
we review our experience with 70 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy , and discuss the benefits and pitfalls in diagnosis we encountered utilizing this technique .
it also proved useful in the evaluation of the hiv+ patient with equivocal findings on physical exam , and of stable patients with indeterminate or 
while other authors have demonstrated its sensitivity in the detection of diaphragmatic injuries , we urge caution in its use as the primary diagnostic study in penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma based on our experience with missed major intrathoracic injuries , and are currently investigating the complementary role of thoracoscopy in penetrating lower thoracic injuries .
dissatisfied with our own 33% negative laparotomy rate , prospective evaluation of the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in the evaluation of suspected penetrating abdominal injury was undertaken in september 1995 to identify those patients who could safely avoid surgical intervention , with the expectation that the rate of negative trauma celiotomy would markedly decrease . in this report
