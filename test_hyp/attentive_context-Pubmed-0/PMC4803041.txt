, we discuss the etiology of pediatric mtc and currently available therapeutic modality for the cancer .
the early onset of mtc in hereditary syndromes makes it an important endocrine disease that is increasingly managed by pediatric providers   . in this review
thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasia which accounts for about 1% of human cancers .
mtc and the men type 2 syndromes are rare but significant endocrine diseases that are increasingly encountered by pediatricians .
hereditary mtc occurs as a familial mtc ( fmtc ) or as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia ( men ) type 2a and b syndromes , wherein other endocrine glands are also affected .
our understanding of mtc has been greatly increased by the discovery of ret and the genotype 
sporadic mtc is very rare ; the vast majority of mtc diagnosed in the childhood is hereditary .
advances in predictive genetic testing for ret mutations have enabled early diagnosis of hereditary men syndromes and prophylactic thyroidectomy in presymptomatic patients to prevent mtc .
due to limited adjuvant treatment options , adequate surgical treatment is critical for initial control of the disease and prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for children with men2a and men2b at an early age , sometimes during infancy .
