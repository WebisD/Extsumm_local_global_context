in addition , we set out to determine whether the duration of implantation and the anatomic location of the bone screws about the elbow were associated with bone screw failure during removal procedures
. a better understanding of metallic hardware failure during removal procedures may help surgeons in the preoperative planning stages of these cases , in terms of surgical tool selection and staff availability .
overall , compared to stainless steel , failure of titanium alloy screws during removal was not found to be statistically significant ( p = 0.61 ) .   in order to determine whether there were any association between the duration of implantation and hardware failure during removal
, cases were divided into two groups : group ( 1 ) duration of hardware implantation was 12 months or less ( mean 7.7 , range two to 12 months ) , and group ( 2 ) : duration of implantation was more than 12 months ( mean 41.6 , range 16 to 74 months ) .
inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) deep implant removal cases , ( 2 ) hardware removed from the distal humerus or the proximal ulna , and ( 3 ) isolated elbow injuries .
