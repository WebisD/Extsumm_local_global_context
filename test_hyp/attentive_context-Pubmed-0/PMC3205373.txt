we recently managed two large appendiceal mucoceles by laparoscopic resection and report our technique herein .
laparoscopic appendectomy is widely used for the treatment of appendicitis , but laparoscopic resection of appendiceal mucoceles is not routine .
an appendiceal mucocele is a cystic dilatation of the appendiceal lumen by accumulation of mucus , and may include mucosal hyperplasia , a mucinous cystadenoma , or a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma . frequently , the diagnosis of an appendiceal mucocele is made post - operatively because the manifestations are similar to appendicitis .
mucoceles of the appendix are uncommon , accounting for only 0.2 to 0.3% of appendectomy specimens .
a 44-year - old woman sought evaluation from a gynecologist for a palpable right lower quadrant mass .
nevertheless , if we can handle the tissue with minimal manipulation , and can secure enough safety by using various laparoscopic instruments , laparoscopic resection of an appendiceal mucocele might be an alternative surgical option to open surgery .
the authors are also aware of the possibility of rupture during laparoscopic dissection , and the subsequent fatal complication of pseudomyxoma peritonei .
the benign form of a mucocele is a mucinous cystadenoma and the malignant form is a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma .
