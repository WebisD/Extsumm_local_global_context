nonetheless , pennington and colleagues , in their systematic review of the effectiveness , cost - effectiveness , equity , and acceptability of different types of hrla role , identified some evidence that lay - led self - management interventions can be both effectual and cost - effective .
given that self - management of type 2 diabetes is dependent on healthy lifestyle choices , the study of health trainer improved patient self - management ( ships ) was a randomised controlled feasibility pilot trial ( rct ) to develop and then compare a lht intervention to improve patient self - management with usual care for those with low health literacy and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) .
