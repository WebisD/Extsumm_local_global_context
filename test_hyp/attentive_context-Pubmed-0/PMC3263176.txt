the challenge to the physicians is to lower blood glucose to normal values to decrease the risk for long - term complications and at the same time minimize hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia - associated morbidity and mortality .
hypoglycemia is a very common side effect of insulin therapy and , to a lesser extent , of treatment with sulfonylureas .
episodes of severe hypoglycemia are common during intensive therapy in type-1 and type-2 diabetes in the out - patient as well as in - patient setting .
patients with coronary artery disease ( cad ) and diabetes have higher mortality and morbidity than patients without diabetes . data from studies such as
several studies have shown that the hypoglycemia is associated with a significant lengthening of the corrected qt interval ( qtc ) in subjects with and without diabetes .
diabetes , sudden nocturnal death (  dead in bed  syndrome ) is rare .
sudden death during sleep has been described in patients with type-1 diabetes , the mechanism being a significant cardiac arrhythmia induced by nocturnal hypoglycemia .
the uk prospective diabetes study suggest that very good glycemic control is associated with fewer cardiovascular events .
risk factors for severe hypoglycemia include age , duration of diabetes , strict glycemic control , sleep , impaired awareness of hypoglycemia , renal impairment , c - peptide negativity and previous history of severe hypoglycemia .
