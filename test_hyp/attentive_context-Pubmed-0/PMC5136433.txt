even if there was no correlation of 2 m with inflammation , in high - flux membrane hemodialysis patients , our finding indicates that 2 m might have an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases .
2 m levels were upper in patients with high crp levels , but there was no significant relationship between crp or il-6 and 2 m ( r= 0.11 , p <
the aim of this study is to investigate the association of 2-m with inflammatory markers , dyslipidemia and mineral disorders in high - flux membrane hemodialysis patients .
serum concentration of 2 m positively correlated with p and pth ( r= 0.53 , p < 0.001 ; r=0.58 , p < 0.05 ( table 2 ) , whereas negatively with calcium ( r = -0.50 , p < 0.01 ( table 2 ) , which proves that 2 m has direct impact in mineral disorders and cardiovascular risk in hd patients . it has been suggested that the predictive value of serum 2 m concentration is superior to that provided by established prognostic factors for mortality , such as glomerular filtration , cystatin c and crp ( 26 ) . during the follow - up period of three years , 6 out of 40 patients had died from cardiovascular events .
