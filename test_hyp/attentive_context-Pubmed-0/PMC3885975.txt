this work provides a novel mechanism for a.  actinomycetemcomitans - induced tissue damage during infection .
while studying the interaction between wbcs and vascular endothelial cells , we found that relatively high doses of ltxa irreversibly damaged endothelial cells and caused changes in expression levels of endothelial adhesion molecules .
however , in our study endothelial cells were only affected by ltxa in a relatively high dose rage from 500  ng / ml to 5  g / ml , whereas lfa-1 bearing cells such as macrophages or human pbmcs were already affected at 110  ng / ml   and minimal amounts of ltxa have been shown to induce a rapid proinflammatory reaction in human macrophages , already at a ratio of 1 bacterium / macrophage . to our knowledge concentrations of ltxa locally present in patients with lap
, we demonstrate that ltxa significantly increased expression levels of icam-1 and vcam-1 in endothelial cells further corroborating pro - inflammatory effects of ltxa . additionally , ltxa has important anti - proliferative as well as pro - apoptotic effects on microvascular endothelial cells and induces a g2/m phase cell cycle arrest .
we found that a single dose of purified ltxa administered to human microvascular endothelial cells ( hcmec / d3 ) importantly and irreversibly inhibits cell proliferation by g2/m cell cycle arrest .
