we report a young man who had concurrent post - splenectomize hb h - cs disease and jak2 v617f mutation - positive pv and developed acute non - atherosclerotic st - elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) early in the course of the disease .
we report a case of acute stemi in a young patient with hb h - cs disease and pv .
this case report represents the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of pv in patients who have underlying inherited anemia such as thalassemia .
polycythemia vera ( pv ) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm ( mpn ) which is characterized by the proliferation of red blood cells independent of a normal control mechanism .
pv can occur in young patients and also in patients who have reactive thrombocytosis that may result in a delayed diagnosis .
a 17-year - old man was referred from a regional hospital to our institute for evaluation of his elevated platelet counts .
the diagnosis of pv in this case was based on the bone marrow findings of panmyelosis , an increased red cell volume , and a presence of jak2 v617f mutation . from the world health organization ( who ) 2008 diagnostic criteria
