the authors experienced a bronchial spasm after an unexpected elevation of the st segment , followed by ventricular fibrillation immediately after sudden bradycardia and hypotension , which was suspected to be a coronary spasm .
therefore , a close diagnosis using the mdct at the early phase should be made , and the management of peri - operative anesthesia for patients with an underlying disorder , such as mb , requires discreet judgments in anesthetic methods and medication use with more caution in monitoring the ecg and vital signs .
typically , most of the coronary artery rests on the epicardium but some cases , the epicardial coronary artery runs congenitally into the myocardium . during the systole , the heart muscle exerts pressure across the region and constricts the coronary artery , which is called the myocardial bridge ( mb ) . since
coronary angiography is a common procedure and non - invasive methods , such as multidetector computed tomography ( mdct ) , can make a diagnosis of even a minute part more simple , myocardial bridges have been found in a substantial number of patients , even though the prevalence varies according to the report .
a myocardial bridge is a congenital coronary anomaly that is present when a segment of the epicardial coronary artery runs intramurally through the myocardim and the coronary artery is compressed with each systole .
