chronic inflammation seems to play a major role in the onset and development of cancer . understanding the interaction between the cellular and molecular factors that mediate inflammation in nsclc , including
the rather unexplored components of innate immunity such as macrophages and neutrophils , can elucidate novel targets affecting key oncogenic pathways in this malignancy and allow preventing cancer cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and metastasis . inhibiting cd47 as promoter of neutrophil extravasation and migration
although these checkpoint inhibitors have proven efficacy in patients , their mechanism of action implies side effects as the onset of autoimmune diseases and a series of endocrine disorders   .
may reduce inflammation thereby preventing cancer , and blocking the antiphagocytic signal of cd47 on the surface of tumor cells can overcome immune suppression , harnessing the immune system to target malignant cells more effectively .
conventional therapies are based on chemotherapy and radiotherapy but with low efficacy . over the last decade , there have been advances in the study of molecular pathways underlying tumor development leading to the development of targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) and antibodies directed against the two main actionable genes in nsclc up to now : mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) gene targeted by tkis like gefitinib   , erlotinib   , and afatinib   and translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( alk ) gene treated with the tki crizotinib , alectinib , and ceritinib .
