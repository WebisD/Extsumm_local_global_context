taking into account the limitation of this in vitro study , etching the surface of set glass - ionomer with a total - etch system or placement of self - etch adhesive on the surface of glass - ionomer with incomplete initial setting compromised bonding of giomer to glass - ionomer .
however , no studies to date have evaluated the bond strength between glass - ionomers and giomers ; therefore , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three surface preparation methods on the shear bond strength of giomer to different surface treated conventional glass - ionomer .
moreover , the use of self - etch adhesive resin ( fl - bond ii ) in groups 2 and 3 resulted in the thicker hybrid zone than total - etch adhesive resin ( single bond ) in group 1 .
pairwise comparisons by a tukey test revealed that there were statistically significant differences in shear bond strengths between group 2 and the two other groups ( p < 0.0005 ) , whereas the bond strength difference between groups 1 and 3 was not statistically significant ( p = 0.609 ) . means and standard deviations ( sd ) of the shear bond strengths ( mpa ) measured in study groups
