severe congenital neutropenia ( scn ) is a disorder of neutrophil production predisposed to recurrent and severe bacterial infection from early infancy .
we described inherited scn cases showing different disease severity with the same mutation of the elane gene in a korean family .
although types of elane mutation largely differ among these diseases , specific mutations were associated with both scn and cn in unrelated patients and in patients with a shared haplotype by a sperm donor , but not in the same family ( 1 , 2 ) .
although many genetic aberrations responsible for this condition were reported , scn largely derives from elane gene mutations which are known to be correlated with more severe neutropenia and serious clinical manifestations in scn .
, the patients revealed different clinical phenotypes from life - threatening infections to no symptoms regardless of ancs despite the same elane mutation in the family .
a 17-month - old korean girl ( patient 1 ) was admitted to the department of otolaryngology , gachon university gil medical center , with mild fever and neck swelling in january 2013 . on admission ,
it is suggested that the disease phenotype is not determined by the mutation alone and other factors can contribute to clinical features of patients .
