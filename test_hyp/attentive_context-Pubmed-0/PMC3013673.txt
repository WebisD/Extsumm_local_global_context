besides , elaborate schematic diagrams of phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways are constructed and provided in ahd2.0 , which represents the first effort to integrate a large volume of data sets into a comprehensive regulatory network for each hormone ; second , we integrated orthologs of sequenced plants in orthomcl - db ( 13 ) into each gene in the database for comparative genomic or evolution studies of phytohormone related genes ; third , we predicted microrna splicing site of each gene .
based on these newly developed features , ahd2.0 would greatly intensify and expand its capability in the systematic studies of plant hormone responses .
the sequence of each binding site is now also available for performing further analysis such as primer design ; fourth , we provided the genetic relationship of these phytohormone related genes manually curated based on published literatures ; fifth , for the convenience of in - time bioinformatics analysis , we provided links to a powerful online analysis platform weblab , which was recently developed by us .
one example is a recently published work using mathematical modeling to illustrate how polaris gene functions and interacts with auxin , ethylene and cytokinin in arabidopsis ( 12 ) . in an attempt to cover the above - mentioned advances and extending the functionality of the previous ahd , we have updated our database from its first version to ahd2.0 . in this update version , we made tremendous modifications and improvements to the original database and added several new features to cater to nowadays interests
