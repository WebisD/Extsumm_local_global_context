the aim of this retrospective study was to determine the accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , and negative predictive value ( npv ) of tvs in the diagnosis of adenomyosis and leiomyoma confirmed by postsurgical histopathological findings .
this study demonstrated that tvs is a valuable noninvasive method that should be utilized in the diagnosis of leiomyoma and combined adenomyosis and leiomyoma .
the importance of an accurate noninvasive diagnostic method like ultrasound for adenomyosis , leiomyoma , or combined is an ongoing need in the gynecological community .
the sensitivity of tvs in the diagnosis of adenomyosis was 84.55% ( 95% ci 76.4 - 90.7 , p < 0.0001 ) and the specificity was 43.40% ( 95% ci 29.8 - 57.7 , p = 0.41 ) .
diagnostic criteria of uterine adenomyosis include two of the five sonographic features on tvs : ( 1 ) no distinction of the endometrial - myometrial junction ; ( 2 ) asymmetry of the anterior and posterior myometrium ; ( 3 ) subendometrial myometrial striations ; ( 4 ) myometrial cysts and fibrosis ; and ( 5 ) heterogeneous myometrial echotexture . diagnostic criteria of uterine leiomyoma include two of the five sonographic features on tvs : ( 1 ) clear demarcation of the tumor margin ; ( 2 ) whorly appearance of the tumor content ; ( 3 ) the presence of blood vessels ( by color doppler ) surrounding the tumor ; ( 4 ) irregularities of the uterine surface ( subserous and intramural tumors ) ; and ( 5 ) irregularities of the endometrial surface ( submucous tumors type 1 and 2 ) .
