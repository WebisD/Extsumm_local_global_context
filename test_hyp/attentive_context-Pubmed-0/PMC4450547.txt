a number of gases are produced endogenously in humans and have roles in the pathology of various diseases . among these gases , nitric oxide ( no ) and carbon monoxide ( co ) have vital roles in the physiology of the body . since the last decade
is it a cause or consequence of the disease?h2s acts by vasodilatation , so  blocking effect can be investigatedbh4 and h2s effects in hypertension can be studiedthe molecular mechanism of h2s can be studied using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionsome selective inhibitors can be introduced to avoid inhibition of unwanted enzymesreleasers of h2s introduced as present releasers are inconsistent and have sustained - release property . 
 
if both molecules are present ; then , which one is responsible for the vasorelaxant effect?concentration of h2s decreased in hypertension .
future studies must verify whether the intermediate molecule formed as a result of interaction between no and h2s is nitroxyl or nitrosthiol or both .
, hydrogen sulfide ( h2s ) has captured the interest of scientists because of its significant role in different systems of the body .
some studies have also reported the toxic effects of h2s on the central nervous system ( cns ) and respiratory system .
