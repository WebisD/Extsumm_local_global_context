this review will focus on scorpion venom and its major toxins and their functions in excitable cells .
the balance between proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines in envenomation determines the degree and extent of inflammation which can lead to major clinical effects such as cardiac dysfunction , pulmonary edema and shock . in line with the findings , high levels of tnf- , il-1 , il-6 and il-8
the cytokines regulate and amplify the immune response , induce tissue injury and mediate complications of the inflammatory response .
equilibrium between pro- and anti - inflammatory is essential to maintain the homeostasis in the system .
it well also compares some of the research done on scorpions from different parts of the world to highlight open areas of interest .
this released of cytokines and other mediators may account for several of inflammatory manifestations observed such as acute respiratory of inflammatory manifestations observed such as acute respiratory distress syndrome , systemic inflammatory responses syndrome and multiple organ failure .
dysregulations of the pro- versus anti - inflammatory are involved in the pathogenesis of envenomation in humans and experimental animals .
potassium channels are part of a large variety of biological processes and also are involved in an increasing number of human pathologies     . the diversity of potassium channel blockers and their therapeutic value to overcome in the potential treatment of a number of specific human diseases specially autoimmune disorders , inflammatory neuropathies  and  cancer .
