, 
  we used the whole - cell voltage clamp technique to examine the effects of turgor pressure on junctional coupling of isolated pairs or small groups of cochlear supporting cells . both input capacitance (
we report that data obtained with 
  both techniques indicate that positive intracellular 
  pressure , which is known to induce membrane tension , 
  uncouples gap junctions of supporting cells in corti 's 
  organ .
2 a , bath application of hypo - osmotic solution 
  ( 150 mosm ) caused a hensen cell pair to swell ( insets ) 
  and decreased cin of the pair to single cell levels .
we provide evidence , based on input capacitance and 
  double voltage clamp measures , that junctional coupling is sensitive to positive turgor pressure - induced 
  membrane tension .
our data indicate that membrane stress acts 
  on inner ear gap junctions in a manner independent of 
  ca , ph , and protein kinases .
the 
  correlation of cin with degree of cell coupling is illustrated by real measures of cin in a coupled two - cell electrical model ( fig .
