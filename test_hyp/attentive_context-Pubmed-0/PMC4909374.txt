daily symptom tracking can facilitate improved informal learning as well as rigorous n - of-1 experimental studies to objectively assess individual treatment efficacy and individualize patient care.34,35 prototype studies have provided proof of concept so that these methods can be further expanded to enable more robust learning designed to improve symptoms and qol for pediatric patients with ibd and others with differing chronic health conditions .
clinicians and patients should consider the use of mobile daily symptom data collection to improve care and outcomes .
this study was conducted as part of the ongoing work of the collaborative chronic care network ( c3n ) project that is developing innovations to facilitate more continuous , collaborative relationships between patients and families with chronic illness and their physicians .
currently , 78 percent of teenage patients carry mobile devices capable of easily collecting and transmitting symptom data on a daily basis.8 there is growing interest among patients ( e.g. , the  quantified self  community)5,9,10 and physicians1115 in leveraging mobile technologies for improving patient outcomes . according to a recent study by the pew research center ,
these findings lend face validity to daily remote monitoring of patient symptoms , and pave the way for broader use of the promis instruments for use in patient - centered improvement research . using standard promis instruments , in addition to more customized patient symptoms , may enable greater learning across patients because measures are well validated and standardized in pediatric populations .
