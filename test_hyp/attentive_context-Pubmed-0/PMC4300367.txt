complete remission or complete response 
 means that all of the tumors completely disappeared , and partial remission means that the 
 tumors regressed more than 50% , but less than 100% . in our study , three to eight 
 administrations of vincristine at a dose of 0.7 mg / m were able to induce 
 complete remission in five dogs ( 83.33% ) .
method validation : the results of intra - day and inter - day precision and 
 accuracy of the assay are presented in table

the present study was 
 conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of vincristine sulfate in dogs with tvt 
 and to determine their correlation with the clinical effects of the drug using the 
 well - suited lc - ms / ms method to determine the concentration of vincristine sulfate in dog 
 plasma .
five duplicates of the quality control 
 ( qc ) sample at concentrations of 2 , 50 and 100 ng / ml were 
 prepared and used to determine the recoveries , intra - day and inter - day precision , and 
 accuracy of the method .
