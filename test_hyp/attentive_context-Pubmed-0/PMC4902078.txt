, we investigated the presence of epistasis among a panel of snps previously validated individually in lung cancer ( 26 ) and used both area under the receiver operating characteristic ( auc ) analysis and net reclassification improvement ( nri ) to assess the contribution of adding an interactive epistatic effect to an extensively validated clinical - based risk model for lung cancer .
using genotype data from 2385 individuals included in the independent validation of snps identified in a candidate - gene genetic association study from the llp case - control study , we found the 3 loci genotype interaction rs2306022 ( itga11 ) , rs5744256 ( il-18 ) and rs1799732 ( drd2 ) provided the best classifier of disease status using both mdr and rf . adding these snps to a clinically - based lung cancer risk model lead to an increase in auc ( 0.75 to 0.81 ) ; and
this study demonstrates the use of comprehensive analytical techniques for investigating the contribution of adding an interactive effect of a panel of genetic markers ( snps ) to the prediction of individual absolute risk of developing lung cancer , using a risk model similar to the llp model ( 3 ) .
