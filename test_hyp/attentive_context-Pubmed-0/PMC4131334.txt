this rare case is reported for the coincidental presentation of oculocutaneous albinism and isolated orbital plexiform neurofibroma without any systemic features of neurofibromatosis 1 in the same patient and probably the first case to be reported .
a 70-year - old female with oculocutaneous albinism , presented with proptosis of the right eye for 15 days and defective vision of both eyes since birth , which got worsened in the right eye for the past 15 days .
a very rare case has been reported showing the genetic associations between partial albinism and neurofibromatosis in two daughters of a family along with axenfield 's defect , congenital deafness and peroneal muscular dystrophy .
oculocutaneous albinism is associated with syndromes such as prader willi syndrome , angelmann syndrome , hermansky pudlack syndrome and chediak - higashi syndrome .
similar cases of orbital plexiform neurofibromas without the systemic features of neurofibromatosis 1 have been reported in literature .
plexiform neurofibromas , the most common orbital subtype , occur exclusively in neurofibromatosis type 1 .
neurofibromas of the orbit are rare and account for 0.6 - 2.4% of all orbital tumors .
however , isolated orbital plexiform neurofibroma in association with albinism has not been reported so far .
