, we determine the prevalence of transmigrant maxillary and mandibular canines in a north indian population and describe the clinical and radiographic features of patients with transmigrant impacted canines .
the present study is the first to report the prevalence of both transmigrated maxillary and mandibular canine in india . in the current study
type 3 canine is the rarest form of transmigrant mandibular canine and a classification system for maxillary transmigrant canine to aid in the diagnosis and management is long overdue .
a prospective study of 3000 panoramic radiographs ( 1695 males and 1305 females ) was conducted in two dental colleges in haryana for 8 months from september 2013 to april 2014 .
the prevalence of mandibular canine transmigration was 0.5% ( 15/3000 ) whereas the prevalence of 0.16% ( 5/3000 ) was recorded for the maxillary canine transmigration ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .
in the present study , the prevalence of maxillary and mandibular canine transmigrated canines was evaluated which is in contrast to the only previous indian study related to transmigrated teeth , that focussed only on mandibular canines .
