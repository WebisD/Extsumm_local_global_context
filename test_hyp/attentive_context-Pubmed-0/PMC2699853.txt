only the ari , and not aspirin , prevented the pro - oxidant and proinflammatory changes in gene expression , consistent with the discordant effects of the two drugs on other indicators of diabetes - induced oxidative stress and inflammation ( this work and ( 10,11 ) .
sorbinil led to normalization of expression of 71% of genes related to oxidative stress and 62% of those related to inflammation , whereas the figures for aspirin were 29 and 3% , respectively ( p < 0.0001 for effect of sorbinil vs. aspirin on inflammation - related genes ) .
this effect of angiotensin ii blockers , coupled with our findings of an overactive tgf- pathway in diabetic retinopathy , may need to be taken into account in interpreting the encouraging results obtained with candesartan in the primary prevention of retinopathy in normotensive type 1 diabetic patients ( 52 ) .
the next steps in these studies are to define the effects of selective normalization of tgf- signaling in retinal vessels and ascertain whether the tgf- pathway is overactive in human diabetic retinopathy .
we compared the effects of diabetes on gene expression in retinal vessels to those in mller cells , the principal glia of the retina that shows signs of activation / reactivity in both human ( 37 ) and experimental ( 6 ) diabetes .
