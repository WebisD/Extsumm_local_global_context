self - stretching of the accessory inspiratory muscles improved chest muscle 
 length and thus improved pulmonary function . in conclusion ,
self - stretching of the accessory 
 inspiratory muscles should be included in intervention programs aiming to strengthen 
 pulmonary function .
therefore , this study examined the effects of cervical muscle 
 self - stretching on pulmonary function , especially slow vital capacity .
the main self - stretching exercise 
 consisted of 4 types of muscle exercises targeting the sternocleidomastoid , upper trapezius , 
 scalene , and levator scapulae muscles were performed 3 times for 30 seconds each .
in the experimental group , evc increased significantly from 2.71 to 3.18 after 
 self - stretching ( p < 0.05 ) .
the study sample consisted of 30 subjects ( 10 males and 20 females ) who were studying at a 
 university in busan , korea .
meanwhile , choi and oh8 
 report that chest mobilization exercise improves the pulmonary functions of stroke patients . 

the subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups of 15 each : the experimental group 
 performed stretching , while the control group received no treatment . for the stretching 
 program ,
data are mean  sd , * p < 0.05 comparison of the changes in pulmonary function between groups showed evc , erv , irv , and ic 
 were significantly higher in the experimental group ( p < 0.05 ) .
