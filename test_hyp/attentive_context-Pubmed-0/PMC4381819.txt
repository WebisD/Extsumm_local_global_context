carbon dioxide - based angiography using an automated injection system appears feasible in patients undergoing infra - diaphragmatic diagnostic or interventional procedures .
this case series , reporting on the clinical use of the angiodroid automated injection system for co2 in patients with peripheral artery disease or undergoing transcatheter sympathetic renal denervation , has the following implications : a ) co2 injection for infradiaphragmatic diagnostic and interventional procedures appears feasible ; b ) despite an obvious learning curve , imaging accuracy could be improved with the use of simple ancillary devices , such as the swan - ganz balloon - tipped dual lumen catheter ; c ) co2 may be particularly appealing as a contrast medium in patients undergoing transcatheter sympathetic renal denervation , given its adequate imaging yield and lack of renal toxicity ; d ) based on our learning curve analysis , we may tentatively speculate that experienced endovascular specialists after only 10 cases could be confident to rely only or mostly on co2 for their diagnostic or interventional procedures in infra - diaphragmatic vessels .
this technology may appear particularly promising for transcatheter renal sympathetic denervation and lower limb procedures .
we hereby report our experience and learning curve , in order to provide guidance on adoption and improvement .
