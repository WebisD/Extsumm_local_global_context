the measurements showed that up and mp are clinically reliable denture liner materials . from a clinical aspect , for long - term clinical serviceability
comparisons between these two treatments showed that there were differences in samples of up , dl , mp , and tr , but indifferences in samples of uh after immersion in dw and aging .
the results of anova and pairwise comparisons indicated that there were significant differences among the materials after immersion in dw ( except up and dl ; mp and tr ) ( for dw h=25.455 ; p<.001 ) and after aging ( except up and mp ) ( for aging h=25.974 ; p<.001 ) ( table 5 ) .
12 , the denture liner should pass the color stability test , which requires that the specimen show no more than a slight color change after an exposure of 24 hours.27 this requirement might be difficult to achieve because most of the liners show noticeable color changes when exposed to ultraviolet light.28 hence , the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of accelerated aging on the color stability of silicone and acrylic denture liners by using a colorimeter .
