we describe a patient with known cll who developed incapacitating , recurrent severe abdominal pains , culminating in partial bowel resection .
acquired angioedema ( aae ) , an acquired deficiency of c1esterase inhibitor , is a medically treatable condition which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen .
this disorder is strongly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) and other indolent lymphoplasmacytic disorders .
wider appreciation of the possibility of aae , particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders , could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery .
a 78-year - old woman with atherosclerotic vascular disease was transferred to our hospital with abdominal pain and underwent emergent laparotomy .
approximately 145 cases have been reported of aae,3 and this is one of four cases that we have diagnosed in the last decade with abdominal pains from aae with associated cll .
table  1 shows characteristics of patients with cll and aae we have seen ( some briefly mentioned in a prior report).4 this is our only case to undergo surgery , allowing unique and dramatic demonstration of massive bowel edema visible radiographically , on surgical inspection and on histopathology .
one year earlier , she had been diagnosed with rai stage i cll which had been observed without treatment .
