, this study was designed to histologically and histomorphometrically investigate the efficacy of three types of absorbable collagen membrane of biomend , biogide and cytoplast rtm in treatment of dehiscence defects in canine model .
the membrane - treated groups had a statistically significant increase in bone formation and connective tissue attachment compared to control groups .
, it was concluded that all three collagen membranes were capable of regenerating the lost periodontal apparatus to some extent .
the highest rate of vertical and horizontal bone formation was observed in bg group . according to result of the present study
four healthy adult native female dogs ( 12 months old ; weighting 20 to 25 kg ) were included .
significant differences in treatment groups were observed between cyt and bm ( p = 0.02 ) at 4 weeks and cyt , bm ( p = 0.03 ) and bg , bm at 8 weeks .
the amount of regenerated lamellar and woven bone showed no significant difference between treatment and control groups ( p4 week lb = 0.95 p4 week wb = 0.07 ) [ table 2 ] .
the mean height of newly regenerated bone ( nbh ) showed a significant difference between all treatment and control groups ( p < 0.05 ) except for bm at 4 weeks . among the experimental groups , bone height reached its highest rate in cyt and bg groups after 4 and 8 weeks , respectively .
