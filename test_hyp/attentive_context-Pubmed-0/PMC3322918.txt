the sars outbreak in vietnam began with the admission of a traveler from hong kong on february 26 , 2003 , to hospital a , a 56-bed , three - story , privately owned and expatriate - operated facility located in hanoi . within 2 weeks , extensive nosocomial transmission of sars occurred in workers , patients , and visitors in hospital a. on march 12 , hospital a was closed to new admissions except for sick hospital a workers .
this finding may be explained by differences in infection control practices , use of personal protective equipment ( including masks for patients as well as healthcare workers ) , nursing style , environmental features , and clinical factors such as severity of illness and the absence of a highly infectious sars - cov spreader .
, we found no evidence of sars - cov transmission among hospital b workers , despite contact with laboratory - confirmed sars case - patients and variable infection control practices and use of personal protective equipment .
hospital b treated 33 patients with laboratory - confirmed sars between march 12 and may 2 , 2003 , the discharge date of the last patient ( figure ) .
