il-6 has been shown to be an important tumor promoting cytokine that enforces proliferation and anti - apoptotic effects in tumor cells .
, molecular mechanisms of il-6 signaling in experimental models of crc will be discussed with an outlook on future therapeutic implications .
clinical and experimental data strongly propose a contribution of il-6 signaling to the development of both sporadic and colitis - associated colorectal cancer development . in this regard
experimental studies found an activation of important oncogenic pathways in cancer cells through il-6 . in this article , we review the role of il-6 during sporadic and inflammation - associated crc development . besides data from human crc
several pro - inflammatory cytokines released by innate and adaptive immune cells have been shown to regulate cancer cell growth and thereby contribute to tumor promotion and progression . among these , interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) seems to take a center stage in human cancer development .
, several components of the il-6 signaling pathway such as il-6 , il-6r , jak have been proposed a promising targets for crc therapy . as initial clinical studies using anti - il-6 therapy are on their way
of note , also chronic inflammation is regarded as an important risk factor for the development of cancer .
