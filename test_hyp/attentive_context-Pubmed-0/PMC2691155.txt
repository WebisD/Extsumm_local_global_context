the results from the ongoing studies on iodine status of icelandic adolescent girls and pregnant women are important to evaluate the need for special action with regard to iodine status .
therefore , follow - up studies are essential to evaluate dietary intake and nutrient status on regular basis , and in iceland a study on iodine status of young women is essential .
, trends in dietary intake in iceland show decreased fish and dairy intake especially by the young generation .
the latest dietary survey , from 2002 , showed the diet to have become more similar to the diet in other european countries and the consumption of fish and dairy products had diminished significantly .
however , the study revealed a group of young women , consuming on an average less than 22 g fish per day , and very low amount of dairy products as well . the average intake of iodine by these young women ranged from 86 g / day to 130 g / day which is below the rdi of iodine .
these changes were seen most clearly for young people , but previously the references for iodine status in iceland had been considered outstanding due to the good iodine status in earlier times ( 18 ) . according to the latest diet research , intake of salt is too high in iceland , like in other western countries ( 7 ) .
