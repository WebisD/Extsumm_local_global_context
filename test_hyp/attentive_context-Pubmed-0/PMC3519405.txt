disc replacement patients were more likely than fusion patients to be working at 6 weeks postoperatively in one study no significant differences between treatment groups in proportion of patients working after 6 months of follow - up in three rcts earlier return to work following surgery for disc replacement than for fusion across three rcts ; statistically significant differences were seen in two studies one study reported equivalent activity levels at 24 months in both treatment groups
