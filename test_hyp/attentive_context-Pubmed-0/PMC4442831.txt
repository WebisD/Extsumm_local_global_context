the purpose of this study was to look for the degree of genomic diversity among h. pylori strains isolated from unrelated iranian children , on the basis of vaca genotype , caga status of the strains , and age , sex , as well as the pathological status of the patients .
h. pylori strains isolated from children in iran are extremely diverse and this diversity is not related to vaca /caga
as more relationship existed between the strains isolated in the close period , this diversity may be related to adaptation of h. pylori strains to variable living conditions in various host , during time .
most of the current information about genetic diversity of h. pylori has been obtained from genetic analysis of the sequence data obtained from h. pylori strains isolated in diverse geographical regions . in the present study , 44 h. pylori isolates from 44 different non - related individuals , were characterized in order to define the h. pylori population structure .
genotype / status of the strains , as well as to sex , age and pathological status of the child patients .
numbers in left represent the number of strains according to the table relationship between comparable shared fragments ( bands ) on pfge gels and vaca / caga genotype / status of the strains comparison of the pfge patterns between the isolates of group i ( 199799 ) , ii ( 20012003 ) , iii ( 20052007 ) , and iv showed the considerable genomic changes over time .
