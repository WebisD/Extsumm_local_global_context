this result strongly suggest that continuous follow - up of scc - ag levels is helpful for early detection or prediction of relapse in patient with cervical cancer .
the first objective of this study was to identify patient- , disease- , and treatment - related factors associated with an unusual scc - ag response , and the second objective was to determine whether scc - ag is a useful tumor marker in patients with unusual scc - ag patterns or whether an alternative approach is needed .
the effectiveness of scc - ag level as a tumor marker and its role as a prognostic factor have been validated in the present study as consistent with previous studies .
the 5-year dfs rates of groups i , ii , and iii were 7.1% , 9.1% , and 0% ( p=0.418 ) , and the 5-year os rates were 34.3% , 58.4% , and 33.3% ( p=0.142 ) , respectively .
as shown in tables 1 and 2 , differences in stage , pathologic type , lymph node involvement , median value of initial scc - ag , and biochemical response were observed between the normal ( group iii ) and unusual ( groups i and ii ) scc - ag groups .
