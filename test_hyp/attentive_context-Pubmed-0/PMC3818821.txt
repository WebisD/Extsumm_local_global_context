an extensive literature review was conducted using pubmed from may 26 , 2011-july 16 , 2013 relating cutaneous metastases .
articles chosen for reference were queried with the following prompts :  cutaneous metastases  ,  clinical presentation  ,  histological features  , and
they may be the first manifestation of metastatic spread of an internal malignancy or herald cancer recurrence long after treatment of a primary tumor .
biopsy is mandatory in patients with a history of cancer or those with at high risk of cancer .
breast cancer , colorectal cancer , and melanoma frequently metastasize to the skin in women . in men ; melanoma , lung cancer , and colorectal cancer are the most common sources of cutaneous metastases .
immunohistochemical screening methods continue to improve and assist in diagnosing the primary tumors of origin .
further searches included  treatment  and  management  options for  metastatic breast  ,  metastatic colorectal  ,  metastatic melanoma  ,  metastatic lung  , and  hematologic cancers  .
however , such patterns may differ geographically as a study in taiwan found internal malignancies metastasize to the skin with different frequencies and at rates differing from primarily caucasian populations .
we review the literature on clinical presentation , diagnosis , and advances in the management .
