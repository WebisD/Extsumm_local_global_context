we therefore investigated the role of soluble factors from the intestinal mucosa of cc patients in the regulation of t cells using a novel in vitro model system with the aim of mimicking the in vivo exposure of newly recruited peripheral blood t cells to the soluble factors in the colonic milieu of inflamed cc and normal mucosa .
we also want to evaluate its use in evaluating the effect of drugs , including those in present use , on the colonic mucosal milieu and the lymphocytes there within , thereby facilitating the decision on optimum molecules as well as doses required for suppression of t - cell inflammatory responses .
, we have set up an in vitro model for analysis of the impact of the soluble factors from the colonic mucosa of cc patients on peripheral t lymphocyte activation and cytokine production . despite the subtle inflammation in cc ,
we also noted a significantly increased production of the anti - inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 in the presence of dnb - cm from cc patients compared to noninflamed controls , with the lower protein concentration of cm ( figure 1 ) .
we found more than twofold and eightfold increased levels of il-6 and il-1 , respectively , in dnb - cm from cc patients compared to controls , whereas no alterations were found in the levels of ifn- , il-17a , tnf , il-4 , and il-10 ( table 1 ) or tgf- ( data not shown ) .
