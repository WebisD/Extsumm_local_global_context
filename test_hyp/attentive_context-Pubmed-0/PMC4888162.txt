we concluded that : 
 1-the ga size has a correlation with the iac course . in subjects with small gas
the results may be useful for more accurate localization of the iac on radiographs before dental treatment .
therefore , in this study , we investigated the relationship between the ga size and course of the iac in human dry mandibles using cbct .
in addition , the greatest height of bone can be obtained in the second premolar and first molar regions .
since the iac is located in the lingual side of the mandible , the safe zone for implant placement and pre - prosthetic surgery is believed to be the buccal side .
evaluation of the iac course on the coronal view in segments c1 , c2 , and c3 showed that on the right side , the canal was closer to the lingual cortex in 86% of the cases in c1 , 100% in c2 , and 90% in c3 ; on the left side the corresponding percentages were 77% , 93% , and 93% of the cases , respectively . according to our results ,
but in cases with large gas , the canal is more straight and at the same level as the mental foramen.2-the alveolar crest has the maximum distance from the iac in the second premolar and first molar region .
