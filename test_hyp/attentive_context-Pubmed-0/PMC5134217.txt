the aim of the present work was to report on two cases in which digestive tract occlusion or perforation was found to be associated with brain hemorrhage . in one fetus , finding this association modified the prognosis and the outcome of pregnancy , while in the other , it influenced the postnatal management .
a 39yearold pregnant woman was referred to our multidisciplinary center of fetal medicine at 26 weeks of gestation for reevaluation of fetal intestinal dilatation and ascites .
these two rare cases associating digestive tract occlusion or perforation and brain hemorrhage give us the opportunity to emphasize the need for careful screening of the fetal brain in such acute abdominal conditions . because brain lesions may be delayed , neonatologists and pediatricians should also be vigilant and prescribe transfontanellar us whenever a newborn has a history of bowel ischemia and/or perforation .
because many prenatal disorders involve more than one organ , an important clue of prenatal diagnosis is to look for multiple anomalies .
this approach is clinically important as identifying multiple lesions may impact on diagnosis , prognosis , and pregnancy / postnatal management .
therefore , finding a specific lesion commands detailed examination of the fetus to rule out a possible involvement of other organs .
