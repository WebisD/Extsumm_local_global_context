we present a case of 71-year - old women who developed ncse after use of cefepime after recovering from acute renal failure .
neurotoxicity of cephalosporins has been reported with first generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin , second generation such as cefuroxime , third generation such as ceftazidime and fourth generation such as cefepime and can range from slurred speech , tremor , seizures and ncse.1 the threshold of neurotoxicity is decreased in settings of reduced creatinine clearance , impaired renal function , pre - existing cns conditions , and with use of third and fourth generation cephalosporines.2 ncse is a conditions in which electrographic seizure activity is prolonged and results in non - convulsive clinical symptoms , usually lasting > 30 min.3 cephalosporines , particularly cefepime , have been associated with ncse , especially in adult patients with impaired renal function .
thus , our case suggest more strongly that cefepime induced neurotoxicity may occur in patients with renal dose treatment and with recent history of acute renal failure . in conclusion ,
awareness of the potential neurotoxic clinical manifestations of various antibiotics and high degree of vigilance in critically ill patients is essential in identifying potentially serious though reversible complications of antibiotic therapy particularly with the advent of newer antimicrobial agents .
