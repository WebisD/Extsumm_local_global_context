this study finds multidimensionality of alcohol withdrawal symptoms as measured with ciwa - ar ; we found three factors explaining 68.74 percentage of variance and named as delirious , autonomic and nonspecific .
the acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms was most severe at 36 hours of abstinence in our sample .
the present study was carried out to explore the dimensionality of this scale in an attempt to identify a set of underlying factors that exist and can explain the interrelationships among various manifestations of acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms .
factor analysis ( extraction method - maximum likelihood ) with the 10 items of ciwa - ar for day three , resulted in initial three factors with eigenvalues greater than unity .
the severity of withdrawal symptoms and appearance of complete sets of withdrawal symptoms at the 36th hour may have been influenced by plasma half - life of benzodiazepams being used for detoxification . in this study ,
we examined the factor structure of the ciwa - ar in a population of adult men hospitalized to a tertiary psychiatric institute for treatment of alcohol dependence .
two items of ciwa - ar , namely , auditory disturbances and tactile disturbances were very infrequent in our sample ( 9.5 and 10% ) on day one which increased to 55.1 and 65.7% at 36 hours , other items scoring raised on day two like agitation , orientation and clouding of sensorium , visual disturbances , and paroxysmal sweats ; few other items remained unchanged on day one and two like anxiety and tremor ; however scoring of only this item  headache or fullness in head  improved on day two from 28.9 to 12.9% ( table 2 ) .
