we wish , therefore , to review the gut microbiota and its alterations in , and relationships to , ibs .
functional bowel disorders , including irritable bowel syndrome ( ibs ) , are common gastrointestinal disorders all over the world .
this concept represents a potential paradigm shift in our understanding of the underlying mechanism ( for at least a subset of patients with ibs ) from that of ibs as an entirely psychosomatic disorder to that of a more organic disorder related to an altered gut microbiota and low - grade inflammation .
the literature on pi - ibs , sibo , the relationship between gut microbiota and gi sensorimotor functions , and the potential for probiotics and antibiotics to alter these functions and to improve some of the symptoms of ibs , taken together , provide strong evidence in support of a major role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ibs .
however , in the last few decades , advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ibs have revealed several factors , including alterations in the microbiota , as potentially relevant to the cause of this syndrome and the precipitation of its symptoms .
