, we highlight the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of this ulcerative variant that help to distinguish it from other common ulcerative lesions .
although it is uncommon variant , we recommend it to be considered in the differential diagnosis of solitary large ulcerative lesions especially those located on the extremities or genital region .
a total of fourteen cases were enrolled in this study , and they were collected from al - azhar university hospitals and the national cancer institute , cairo , egypt during the period from 2000 to 2010 .
out of 117 cases of cutaneous gct , only 14 cases ( 12% ) were presented with cutaneous ulcer during the time of diagnosis .
secondary ulceration is uncommon in gct , and to our knowledge there was no previous study that fully discussed the criteria of this clinical variant . in this study
granular cell tumor ( gct ) is an uncommon condition of the skin that was described firstly by weber in 1854 and established as a clinical entity by abrikossoff in 1926 who termed it as granular cell myoblastoma .
pas stain showed positive staining of the cytoplasmic granules in all cases ; the staining was strongly positive in 10 cases ( figure 4(a ) ) and weak positive in 4 cases .
