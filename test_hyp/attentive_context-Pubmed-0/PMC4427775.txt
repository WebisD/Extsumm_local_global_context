the findings of this study demonstrated that , in metabolically well - controlled t2 dm subjects ( baseline hba1c 7.0% ) , adding bromocriptine - qr treatment to their baseline established diabetes treatment regimen significantly aided in maintaining good glycemic control , with a lower likelihood of progressing above an hba1c of 7.0% or requiring intensification of treatment over the ensuing year to maintain hba1c 7.0% .
there were no significant changes in plasma lipid levels or heart rate in either treatment group . compared to placebo , the bromocriptine - qr treated group exhibited a mild reduction in blood pressure ( change from baseline blood pressure ( mean  sd ; mmhg ) : 2.81  16.27 systolic and 1.89  9.76 diastolic in the bromocriptine group ; 0.54  14.86 systolic and 0.56  9.54 diastolic in the placebo group ; between group difference ( ci ) : 1.76 ( 3.09 , 0.42 ) systolic ( p = 0.0099 ) and 1.19 ( 2.00 , 0.38 ) , ( p = 0.0038 ) diastolic ) . among study subjects whose hba1c remained 7.0 during the study period , bromocriptine - qr intervention reduced the fraction of subjects that required intensified concomitant antidiabetes therapy to do so by 47%for the completer population and by 58% for the itt population ( see table 3 for details ) . analyzing all subjects who had a 52-week hba1c measurement , irrespective of changes in concomitant diabetes therapy and adjusting for baseline hba1c , the odds of losing glycemic control ( hba1c > 7.0% after 52 weeks of treatment ) were significantly lower with bromocriptine - qr therapy ( or ( 95% ci ) : 0.63 ( 0.470.85 ) , p = 0.002 ) .
