, we report on a patient with ich who showed a change in the origin of an injured cst from the premotor cortex ( pmc ) to the primary motor cortex ( m1 ) .
diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) can help to investigate the motor recovery mechanism of ich by enabling the direct visualization and estimation of the corticospinal tract ( cst ) .
results from this study suggest a motor recovery mechanism of ich and the important implications regarding brain plasticity and brain rehabilitation after ich .
in this patient , we investigated changes of the injured left cst and found that the injured cst seemed to recover as detected by dti , tms and clinical observation . at 1 month after ich onset , the left cst originated from the pmc by dti , and the mep obtained at the right hand showed low amplitude and a latency compatible with that of the cst .
this study described changes of an injured cst that occurred in concert with motor recovery in a patient with ich . to the best of our knowledge ,
this is the first longitudinal study to demonstrate a change in the origin of an injured cst from the pmc to m1 in ich .
