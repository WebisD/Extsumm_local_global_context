the two cases this reports contributed to pile up of rare lipoma / fibrolipoma with osseous / chondroid differentiation case , and , in addition , immunohistochemical result is contributed to the clarification of the etiology .
further , other names of this subclassification exist in literature ; osteo / chondrolipoma , ossifying / osseous lipoma , lipoma with chondro / osseous metaplasia , and lipoma with cartilaginous / osseous change . the obscure etiology of osseous / chondroid differentiaion led to confusion of the name . to clarify the etiology of osseous / chondroid differentiaion in lipoma , the authors report additional 2 cases of oral lipoma / fibrolipoma with osseous and/or chondroid differentiation and describe the clinical , histopathological , and immunohistological features of these .

				 according to our review of the english - language literature , which included our cases , 6 cases were described as lipoma with osseous component   , 11 cases as chondroid component   and 1 case as fibrolipoma with osseous / chondroid components .
cases reporting on lipoma with osteo / chondroid differentiaion were only 16 cases as a result of retrieving literature from 1960 to 2008 .
fujimara   have reported , but our case 2 is the first report of fibrolipoma with osseous / chondroid differentiation .
