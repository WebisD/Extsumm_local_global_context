a 53-year - old caucasian female with complaints of dry eyes and a burning sensation in the eyes presented to our ophthalmology clinic 5 years ago .
the detection of sp1 and psp antibodies in our patients led to the diagnosis of primary ss in the first and secondary ss in the second patient .
the suny at buffalo school of medicine holds a patent on these autoantibodies that is licensed to immco and nicox .
md , and l.s . , phd , participated in the discovery of the autoantibodies to sp1 and psp .
these cases stress the importance of using autoantibodies besides ro and la in the diagnosis of ss .
a 68-year - old caucasian female with a known history of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) presented to our ophthalmology clinic with complaints of persistent dry eyes and irritation for the last 25 years .
interestingly , the time course in the development of the autoantibodies showed that the sp1 and ca6 antibodies were present very late in the disease .
ss is an autoimmune disease starting in the lacrimal and salivary glands but with eventual systemic involvement of multiple other organs .
however , a diagnosis of ss was not made in either of our patients due to the lack of ro and/or la antibodies .
