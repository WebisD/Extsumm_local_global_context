in this study we have 
 used nus nmr methods to study the relationship 
 between protein folding and aggregation of a globular protein that 
 forms amyloid fibrils from a structured precursor state , using 2 m as the test protein .
the findings presented also suggest that targeting a defined 
 non - native species should be a successful means of controlling the 
 fate of assembly of 2 m and , in principle , that of 
 other amyloidogenic proteins which aggregate via a specific , non - native 
 precursor .
analysis of the folding energy landscape 
 of the protein using real - time nmr revealed that the decreased stability 
 and decreased lifetime of a precise and well - defined native - like amyloidogenic 
 precursor ( it ) are sufficient to tip the balance from aggregation 
 to folding .
the power of the real - time nmr experiments allowed 
 us to identify conditions that stabilize the i1 state ( ph 
 3.6 or addition of 1 m urea at ph 6.2 ) and to perform more detailed 
 nmr experiments on the trapped intermediate state that led to a complete 
 description of the folding mechanism of the murine protein .
moreover , the 
 results highlight the importance of defining the energy landscape 
 of amyloidogenic proteins in detail to allow prediction of their amyloid 
 propensity .
