here , we show that cypa mediates a conserved restriction against a family of capsid mutants in hiv-1 , hiv-2 , and sivmac , and we leverage this phenotype to identify sun2 as an essential host factor in mediating the activities of cypa on hiv-1 wt infection in primary cd4 t  cells .
this enables us to unravel the detailed molecular mechanisms of cypa and sun2 in the context of hiv infection and extends our understanding of the desirable antiviral defenses that are normally bypassed by hiv-1 .
the restriction applies to capsid mutants in hiv-1 , hiv-2 , and sivmac and has been consistently observed in primary cells and cell lines of human , macaque , and mouse origin .
the combined observations that hivac capsids are inhibited at nuclear import and that the nuclear envelope protein sun2 acts as an antiviral factor in hiv infection when overexpressed prompted us to examine whether sun2 could play a role in the restriction of hivac capsids .
as expected , viral mutants with a strong susceptibility to cypa - mediated restriction are rapidly counter - selected in nature : hiv-1 wt escapes this antiviral mechanism and genetic alteration in the virus is required to reveal it , in accordance with the principle of restriction factors ( malim and bieniasz , 2012 ) .
