in addition , only two articles detail the cutaneous reaction to the components of scs systems.6,7 the purpose of this paper is to detail the presentation , clinical course , and histologic findings in three patients with cutaneous reactions to spinal cord stimulator equipment components .
an analysis of the available literature by turner et al found that just over one third of patients have a complication.3 prospective data from a multicenter evaluation of scs for failed back surgery syndrome showed a similar rate of complications , even in the hands of experienced implanters.4 these adverse events are usually lead migration , infection , lead breakage , and unwanted stimulation.4,5 an allergic or immunologic/ inflammatory reaction to the system components is thought to be rare , and has been estimated by cameron to be 0.1%.5 however , the true incidence may be underestimated because clinicians may fail to include it in the differential diagnosis , attributing an inflammatory reaction of the soft tissue surrounding scs components to infection .
spinal cord stimulation ( scs ) has been used since the 1960s to treat chronic refractory pain conditions . in particular , scs has been extensively used to manage the painful symptoms related to chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy following failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndromes . randomized controlled trials of scs for failed back surgery syndrome have reported favorable long - term results.1,2 concurrently , there has been significant technologic advancement in the equipment for scs .
