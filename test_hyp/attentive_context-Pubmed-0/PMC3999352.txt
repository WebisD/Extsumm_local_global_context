hence , our aims in this study were first , to measure the distance of the intraosseous anastomosis in the anterolateral wall of the maxillary sinus from different reference points , and second , to correlate the location of the intraosseous anastomosis with the residual bone height of the maxilla and the tooth positions obtained using ct scans .
the distance from the alveolar bone crest and the maxillary sinus floor to the intraosseous anastomosis in an edentulous patient ( table 1 ) is smaller than that of the dentate cadaver .
we collected information from 283 patients scheduled for implant - supported restorations in the posterior edentulous maxilla .
however , at the molar sites , there was a moderate negative correlation and the regression coefficient was -0.4788 and -0.5772 at m1 and m2 .
an anastomosis between the psaa and the ioa in the sinus anterolateral wall was found in 100% of the cases by cadaver dissection , while the bony canal was identified in 47%-55% of cases with ct images . with ct images ,
the mean distance from the alveolar ridge crest to the intraosseous vascular anastomosis ( iva ) at each tooth position was 19.65.64 mm at the first premolar ( p1 ) , 19.95.87 mm at the second premolar ( p2 ) , 15.64.06 mm at the first molar ( m1 ) , and 16.54.75 mm at the second molar ( m2 ) site ( table 1 ) . in this study , there were only 6 images at the first premolar site ; therefore , for the p1 site , only the measurements were described .
