vegf has been identified as a key molecule in the development of ocular nv and vascular permeability , making it a good therapeutic target for the treatment of amd .
pegaptanib , an anti - vegf therapy , is the first agent to be used in clinical trials for amd and the first aptamer used in clinical trials .
the encouraging preliminary results with animal and clinical trials prompted the fda to grant fast - track status for the treatment of amd .
pegaptanib or other anti - vegf therapies were most effective against amd in the early stages and were not particularly effective against the more established vessels . when comparing different treatments for their efficacy in treating amd using the lineweaver - burke ( lb ) linear plot and correcting for differences in the initial visual acuity score ( vas ) , pegaptanib , pdt , and anecortave acetate produced a similar slope and ranibizumab ( lucentis ) , another anti - vegf therapy , appeared to be the most efficacious treatment , since it is the only treatment proven to reverse the slope of visual acuity on a lb plot .
the phase iii clinical trials showed modest effects , primarily at stabilization of vision and reduction of subretinal fluid .
