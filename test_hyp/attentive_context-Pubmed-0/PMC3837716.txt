the significant relationship between the npi and cmai with the qualid scores at baseline and final assessment suggest that qol is associated with behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .
the objective of this study was to assess the responsiveness of the qualid scale to changes in bpsd due to a therapeutic intervention in a population of long - term care residents with moderate to severe ad . as well , this study evaluated the relationship between the qualid scale and the severity of bpsd as determined by standard validated research scales .
outcome measures at baseline and endpoint qualid scores were compared with scores on the npi , cmai , and cgi at baseline and endpoint ( table 2 ) . at both baseline and endpoint ,
kendall correlations between qualid and other measures correlations between change scores of qualid and other measures between baseline and endpoint
there were statistically significant differences in scores for npi total ( f3,90 = 4.035 , p = .010 ) and its subscale items : agitation / aggression ( f3,90 = 3.721 , p = .014 ) , and irritability ( f3,90 = 3.899 , p = .011 ) ; and cmai total ( f3,90 = 6.301 , p = .001 ) and its subscale items : physical aggression ( f3,90 = 5.928 , p = .001 ) and verbal aggression ( f3,90 = 3.961 , p = .011 ) .
