it also offers the potential to move treatment delivery to the outpatient setting and away from infusion services that are facing challenges due to increased demand for complex treatments.15 the aim of this study was to determine medical resource utilization associated with administration of trastuzumab sc injection compared with trastuzumab iv infusion in patients with her2-positive breast cancer in new zealand .
the results of this descriptive time and motion study suggest that switching to trastuzumab sc injection from trastuzumab iv infusion in a new zealand oncology outpatient treatment setting decreases trastuzumab treatment - related tasks in the care unit , drug preparation time , chair time , and the volume and cost of consumables .
data from this new zealand time and motion study provide an indication that switching from iv to sc administration of trastuzumab has beneficial effects on resource use , including hcp time and consumables needed to administer treatment .
in addition , there was an associated 21%52% reduction in the time hcps spent actively involved in administering treatment.18 patients treated with trastuzumab sc in the united kingdom also spent considerably less time in the care unit ( 30.3 minutes vs 94.5 minutes ) and infusion chair ( 19.8 minutes vs 75.0 minutes ) than did those receiving trastuzumab iv.16 in addition , mean hcp time was markedly lower when the sc formulation was used ( 24.6 minutes vs 92.6 minutes for iv administration ) , and consumable costs were lower (  2.94 vs  8.81 , respectively).16 it should be noted that the latter study included total infusion duration in hcp time , as opposed to the european study , which considered only active patient monitoring during infusion . on the basis of the results of the uk study , it was concluded that switching from trastuzumab iv to the sc formulation could substantially reduce overall treatment costs.16 these findings are similar to those documented after a switch from iv to sc rituximab in non - hodgkin lymphoma patients in the united kingdom , which was also associated with reduced active hcp and chair time and lower costs.20 in a separate trastuzumab analysis , hcps from a subset of prefher centers were asked to rate a variety of factors on their ability to impact cancer center efficiency and time required for trastuzumab administration.21 the biggest perceived impact of switching to trastuzumab sc , according to care unit respondents , was a reduced waiting list for any iv treatment at the infusion unit , followed by the potential for a more - flexible treatment schedule and the ability to treat more patients in the infusion unit.19 respondents perceived that a reduction in dosing errors , reduced drug wastage , and increased staff availability for other tasks would be the main impacts of switching from trastuzumab iv to sc.15 factors such as reduced waiting times and the flexibility to deliver treatment outside the infusion clinic offer the possibility of developing new patient care pathways defining when , where , how , and by whom trastuzumab therapy is administered .
