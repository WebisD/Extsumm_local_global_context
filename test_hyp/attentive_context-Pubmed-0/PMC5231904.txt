for example , in keratoprosthesis surgery where systemic delivery of infliximab has been shown to be protective , or in surgical procedures of the eye that induce ocular inflammation , infliximab prophylaxis may be beneficial . the ability of the dds to deliver various biologic agents to the retina , such as anti - vegf or combination anti - tnf-/anti - vegf agents is an intriguing concept that requires future attention .
the infliximab - loaded dds delivered the drug with considerable therapeutic effect , not only to the cornea but also to the retina .
our results confirm that tnf- is a major mediator of inflammation in the cornea and , perhaps even more importantly , in the retina following ocular alkali burn .
the finding that a low dose of local infliximab delivered via the subconjunctival space can result in substantial retinal neuroprotection should have applications beyond alkali burns .
the upregulation of tnf- expression in burned corneas was positively correlated with large corneal infiltration of leukocytes , delayed corneal wound healing , endothelial cell loss , ulceration , corneal opacity , and neovascularization , as well as with retinal ganglion cell loss and optic nerve degeneration .
