if doxapram treatment was successful , it was used longer ( median ( iqr ) : 5.5 ( 5.7 ) days versus 1 ( 4.65 ) day ; mann - whitney u 722 , p < 0.001 ) but in lower average dosages ( median ( iqr ) : 0.97 ( 0.62 )  mg / kg / hr versus 1.38 ( 0.94 ) , mann - whitney u 952 , p < 0.003 ) . patients who received doxapram therapy for a long period of time , incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis , intraventricular hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia , retinopathy of prematurity , persistent ductus arteriosus , or worsening of pulmonary condition did not increase .
we therefore performed an audit on doxapram use and the effects of doxapram use in two dutch tertiary nicus during the last 5 years .
therefore , this study shows that doxapram as off - label drug is frequently used in premature neonates in neonatal nurseries and especially in the youngest infants . as increased use of doxapram
surfactant administration through a nasogastric tube resulted in doxapram use in 28 percent of the surfactant treated neonates via a nasogastric tube compared to 17 percent of patients receiving standard surfactant therapy . in the coming years
