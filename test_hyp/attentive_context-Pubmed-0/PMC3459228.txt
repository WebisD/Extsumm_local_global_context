  in this paper , three researchers with different primary research interests ( ocular toxicology ftf , dry mouth jjs , and dry eye wdm ) examine several hypotheses concerning medications and their possible roles in causing ded .
this paper is also an attempt to give the clinician some guidelines to assist in their clinical decision making .
hypothesis - driven studies are especially difficult for dry eye since diagnosis of this disease relies in part on subjective testing . in the future , perhaps testing such as osmolarity , standardized meibomian gland tests   , fourier - domain optical coherence tomography , and so forth will be incorporated into clinical practice and will provide a greater degree of repeatability and predictability than is currently available . until these become available , the studies cited here are heavily dependent on subjective assessments , case reports , and summaries of expert committees or organizations
. the data presented here may be speculative and lacking quantification , but may be conceptually useful until a more evidence - based understanding of dry eye is achieved .
this was developed for all of medicine and is the standard for the national registry of drug - induced ocular side effects as a guide to determine causality .
