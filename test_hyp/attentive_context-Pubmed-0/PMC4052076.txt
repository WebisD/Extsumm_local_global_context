the rationale for this study is that since neurotoxic snakebites often occur far from hospitals , by eliminating the need for injection ( e.g. , of parenteral neostigmine or intravenous antivenin ) , we may be able to shorten time to treatment and save lives .
figures 1(a)1(c ) show the effects of neostigmine in mice envenomed with naja naja venom at various concentrations : 2.5 ld50 ( a ) , 5 ld50 ( b ) , and 10 ld50 ( c ) .
mice were pseudorandomized in batches of 5 with tails marked 1 to 5 stripes by sharpie felt tip pen to receive intraperitoneal ( ip ) injections of n. naja venom ( 2.5 ld50 , n = 20 ; 5 ld50 , n = 10 and 10 ld50 , n = 10 ) concomitantly with atropine , which blunts the muscarinic effects of neostigmine and has previously been shown to have no effect on ld50 when experimentally injected with snake venom .
our study is distinguished from those by the replacement of parenteral neostigmine with topically applied in neostigmine .
the primary aim of this pilot study was to test if early in administration of acheis and in principal any venom - inhibiting agent is plausible .
