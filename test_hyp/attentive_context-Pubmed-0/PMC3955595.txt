the aim of our study was to assess the tlr3 , tlr7 , and tlr9 expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) , including cd3 t lymphocytes and their cd4 and cd8 subpopulations , and cd19 b lymphocytes , in patients with sle , compared to healthy controls .
significantly higher percentages of tlr3- and tlr9-positive pbmcs and cd3 t lymphocytes , including those positive for cd4 and cd8 antigens , as well as cd19 b lymphocytes were observed among patients with sle , compared to healthy controls ( figures 2 and 3 ) . a higher percentage of cd19 b lymphocytes expressing tlr7 was found in patients with sle than in healthy subjects ( p < 0.006 ) ( figure 4 ) . with regard to pbmcs and both subpopulations of t lymphocytes , tlr7 expression did not differ between patients and healthy controls ( table 2 ) .
moreover , a correlation between the expression of tlrs and gender as well as pre- and postmenopausal period was evaluated .
in addition , overexpression of tlr7 within the b cell compartment was found to enhance b cell tlr7 expression , permit the specific development of anti - rna autoantibody production , and exacerbate sle disease in an animal model .
