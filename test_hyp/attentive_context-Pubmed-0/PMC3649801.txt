this review aims to clarify the place of hybrid coronary revascularization in the current therapeutic armamentarium against multivessel coronary artery disease .
the medline / pubmed database was searched in january 2012 using the medical subject headings ( mesh ) for  coronary artery disease  and  angioplasty , balloon , coronary  combined with the following free - text keywords :  multivessel coronary artery disease ,   minimally invasive coronary artery bypass ,   percutaneous coronary intervention ,  and  hybrid coronary revascularization  .
the large variability in hcr techniques makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the currently available evidence , but hcr appears to be a promising and cost - effective alternative for cabg in the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease in a selected patient population .
the hcr procedure was associated with short hospital stays ( including icu stay and intubation time ) , low macce and 30-day mortality rates , low prbc transfusion requirements and tvr , high postoperative lita patency rates , and high survival rates .
these concerns implicate the need for close cooperation between surgeon and interventional cardiologist , logistical issues regarding sequencing and timing of the procedures , and the use of aggressive anticoagulant therapy for percutaneous coronary intervention that may worsen bleeding in the surgical patient   .
