we report a case of pndm caused by a novel p.h186d heterozygous mutation in the kcnj11 gene whose treatment was successfully transitioned from insulin to oral sulfonylurea .
early su therapy at disease onset can permit insulin hypersensitivity and maintained basal insulin secretion , then provide long - term remission in animal subset14 ) . allowing for the potential beneficial effect on neurodevelopmental outcome and glycemic control , empiric tiral of su before genetic testing in neonatal diabetes patients can be considered15 ) . in conclusion , as the mutation type , severity of mutation , and duration of the diabetes are the major factors affecting the success of switching to su , early genetic analysis and trial of sulfonylurea is important in the management of neonatal diabetes .
neonatal diabetes mellitus ( ndm ) presenting within the first 6 months of life includes permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( pndm ) , which require lifelong therapy , and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus ( tndm ) where the condition shows remission during infancy but relapses in adolescence .
blood glucose was well controlled without episodes of hypoglycemia and the hba1c has been lower than during insulin injection ( fig .
insulinogenic index [ insulin ( 30 min-0 min)/glucose ( 30 min-0 min ) ] , a marker of beta cell function , became increased from 0.10 to 0.18 , and acute c - peptide response [ c - peptide ( 30 min-0 min)1,000/glucose ( 30 min-0 min ) ] became increased from 6.48 to 8.29 ( table 1 ) .
