the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermocycling and mechanical loading on the biaxial flexural strength and the phase transformation of ce - tzp / al2o3 and compare the results with two y - tzp core materials .
however , maximum forces ranged from 140 to 170 n , and 250 to 400 n in anterior and posterior regions , recpectively.22 investigating the mechanical properties of the newly developed materials under simulated oral cavity conditions and comparing the results with commonly used core materials are needed for defining their clinical acceptance .
however , raman spectroscopy results showed that monoclinic phase fraction of the mechanically loaded specimens were lower at the point p1 where the load was applied .
stress - induced phase transformation is an important factor for strengthening tzp.29 in the present study , the biaxial flexural strengths of nanozr groups were not statistically significant from each other and the values in the lm group were significantly higher than in the lt and lc groups ( p<.001 ) .
the raman spectroscopy results showed that material type ( c , l , and n ) , the point raman spectra taken from ( p1 , p2 , and p3 ) , and the thermocycling and mechanical loading methods ( c , t , and m ) affected the monoclinic phase fraction . when comparing the phase fraction of materials at the same point and the same method , except nm at point p1 and all groups in nanozr at points p2 and p3 , the differences were not significant in all materials ( p>.05 ) . when comparing the points raman spectra taken from the same material and the same method , except for nc and nt groups at point p2 , the nm group at point p3 , and lm group at points p1 and p2
