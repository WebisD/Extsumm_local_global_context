neural stimulation has a long history of use in a range of therapeutic applications , including regulating organ function and treating a variety of neurological disorders . neurostimulators are also used to provide forms of sensory perception ; for example , electrical stimulation of auditory neurons using electrodes implanted in the cochlea can provide hearing sensations to people with a severe to profound hearing impairment .
the initial application for neurobi was to evaluate the capabilities of a suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis in visually impaired humans . using neurobi ,
this enables the stimulation parameter space to be thoroughly explored using an external stimulator and the performance of a suprachoroidal implant to be evaluated .
reproducible phosphenes were successfully elicited in one patient with light perception vision only , suggesting that the suprachoroidal space is a viable implantation site for a retinal prosthesis .
psychophysics testing is being performed to determine the optimum stimulation parameters for a suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis ; to characterize the appearance and location of the visual percepts elicited ; and to investigate how to build useful visual information by stimulating multiple electrodes closely in time .
the results obtained from subsequent experiments performed using neurobi will guide the design of next - generation devices and progress the development of a commercially viable visual prosthesis that can provide functional vision to the profoundly vision - impaired .
