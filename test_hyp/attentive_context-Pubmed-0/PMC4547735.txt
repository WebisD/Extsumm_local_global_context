in the present work , we have investigated the 
 transformation mechanism 
 between two binding modes for 2,6-sa in both the wild type 
 and mutant h1n1 hemagglutinin proteins from 1918 and 2009 pandemic 
 flu using the 6sln ligand .
this information , especially the transition mechanism , the barriers , 
 and the key intermediates , could be helpful in identifying additional 
 therapeutic targets and provide a more complete understanding of the 
 effect of a particular mutation on viral fitness . in the present work , 
 we investigate interconversion pathways between two binding modes 
 to elucidate the contrasting affinity of the two different h1n1 virus 
 mutants for 2,6-sa .
we find that the d222 g mutation 
 exchanges the energetic preference of the two binding modes in both 
 sc18 and nl602 has and that the effect is more dramatic in sc18 . by 
 analyzing the shape of the binding pocket
the different shape , the flexibility of the 
 pocket during binding 
 mode interconversion , and the resulting energy profile changes provide 
 insight into the contrasting pathogenicities induced by the d222 g 
 mutation in the sc18 and nl602 viruses .
, we have identified differences 
 between the two binding modes for the 1918 and 2009 strains .
