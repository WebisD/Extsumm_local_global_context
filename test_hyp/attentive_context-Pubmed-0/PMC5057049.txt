the serum concentration of tktl1 in pca patients and healthy controls was analyzed by means of an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) , which is a highly standardized detection system , and correlated to clinical and histologic parameters .
however , correlation between serum tktl1 and serum psa ( p = 0.38 ) , biopsy and prostatectomy gleason sum ( p = 0.79 and 0.89 , respectively ) , prostate volume ( p = 0.23 ) , psa density ( p = 0.80 ) , clinical and pathologic t - stage ( p = 0.66 and 0.65 ) , highest gleason pattern in the biopsy and prostatectomy specimen ( p = 0.83 and 0.74 , respectively ) , upgrade of gleason sum from biopsy to prostatectomy ( p = 0.86 ) , pn- , l- , v- , n- and r status ( p = 0.32 , 0.88 , 0.30 , 0.90 and 0.32 , respectively ) , extracapsular extension , seminal vesicle invasion as well as d`amico classification ( p = 0.75 , 0.89 and 0.34 , respectively ) did not reach statistical significance . tktl1 serum concentration ( ng / ml ) in pca patients and controls .
