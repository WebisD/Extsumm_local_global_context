the use of la could be limited by the relatively short therapeutic action and systemic toxicity related to high drug plasma concentration as a result of fast systemic uptake .
designing a perfect candidate would require one to have a thorough knowledge of the interaction between the drug and the carrier and the effect of size and drug loading on drug release .
one of the primary objectives in the design of a controlled release system is the controlled delivery of therapeutics to the site with an optimal release rate . from here , two major areas have evolved : ( 1 ) design of good carriers to protect and deliver the therapeutics to the site of action and ( 2 ) development of a sustained drug formulation for a slow and long lasting effect.6 the release of these drugs will be controlled by desorption , diffusion , erosion , or a combination of these factors.7 one approach to prolong the effect of analgesia is to complex the la with drug delivery vehicles .
improvement of regional administration of las could be achieved by incorporating them into drug delivery systems .
liposomes,811 cyclodextrins,12 microspheres,1315 hydrogels,16 and nanospheres6,1720 could encapsulate the la for controlled delivery , prolonged anesthetic effect , and reduced toxicity . from these various types of controlled delivery systems , depending on the end - use requirements , the most popular choice is nanospheres followed by microspheres and hydrogels.21 in this review , different methods of nanogel synthesis and an overview of drug release from nanogel - based delivery vehicles will be described and discussed .
