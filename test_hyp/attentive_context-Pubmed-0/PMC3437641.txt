it is classified into two clinical variants : the classical form , usually composed of multiple and grouped skin - colored , pedunculated and cerebriform nodules that often coalesce to form a plaque and a second more rare form , presenting as a solitary dome - shaped sessile papule or nodule.24 we report here eight cases of nlcs in order to assess the epidemiologic , clinical , and pathological features , as well as the management of this uncommon neoplasm .
nlcs is a rare skin malformation ; we report herein a large case series of eight patients where the classical form is predominant
