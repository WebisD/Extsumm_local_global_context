an infliction in the life expectancy figure of patients with sickle cell disease ( scd ) occurred around the middle of the 1970s ( fig .
this approach in diagnostics and therapeutics ushers in the dawn of a new field for the management of individual patients based on their unique pharmacogenetics , phenotypic and biomarker characteristics .
we hope that this methodology would be approved and sponsored by the insurance companies for patients with scd . in the meantime , listening , believing and respecting the patient with sickle cell pain should be maintained for now as the approach to individualized therapy .
together , current data on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids show great variability of genotypes among patients and extreme variability in individual responses to opioids . determining the pharmacogenetics profile of each patient
facilitates the choice of drugs that would be efficacious for that patient and avoid those drugs associated with harmful drug - drug interaction .
while this controversy was brewing , interesting developments in basic science were in progress to understand the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids .
the steady stream of admissions of patients with acute painful vaso - occlusive crises ( vocs ) to the emergency department ( ed ) and hospital were not welcome by most providers , hospital administration , the house and nursing staffs .
