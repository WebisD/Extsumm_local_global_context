we conducted a retrospective case - control study of caesarean delivery outcomes in the provincial hospital , maroua , cameroon .
caesarean delivery in cameroon is associated with extreme ages of reproductive life , macrosomia , nulliparous and grand multiparous status .
we conducted this retrospective case - control study to identify possible risk factors of delivery through caesarean section that can be used as content of prenatal counselling in cameroon .
the sociodemographic characteristics of women delivered by cs ( n = 125 ) and those delivered vaginally ( n = 244 ) are presented in table 1 . the marital status is similar among the two study populations . compared to women delivered vaginally , women delivered by cs were more likely to be adolescents less than 17 years ( 6% versus 12% ) or to be 40 years old and above ( 3.7% versus 7.2% ) .
women delivered by caesarean section are more likely to be nulliparous ( 26% versus 40% ) , to be grand multiparous ( 13% versus 25% ) , and to have less than 4 prenatal visits ( 23.2% versus 31.6% ) or no prenatal visit at all ( 2% versus 8% ) . the foetal weight at index delivery is presented in table 3 .
