a frequency of 750 hz and an intensity of 200 ma for each bird resulted as the best combination of electrical parameters to obtain an effective stunning for the majority of animals without negative impact on the carcass and meat quality .
the aim of the present work is to identify the optimal setting of electrical parameters to obtain an effective water bath stunning in a commercial poultry slaughterhouse . in particular
the present work aimed to find an optimal setting of electrical parameters for the water bath stunning in a commercial poultry slaughterhouse without any negative influence on carcass and meat .
the results obtained , using several combinations of voltages and frequencies , showed that low frequencies ( 200 hz ) were not able to guarantee adequate welfare conditions with low electric current intensity ( 30 ma / bird ) . an increase in electric current intensity ( 53 and 66 ma / bird ) , maintaining a frequency of 200 hz , produced macroscopic lesions on carcasses with an adverse effect on meat . on the contrary ,
, different combinations of voltage and frequency values were tested in order to achieve a satisfying unconsciousness of the animals until their death . moreover ,
