, quantification of these risk factors was lacking ( 69,11,12 ) . in our study , we focused mainly on case - patients with proven chronic q fever becausethis group included patients with the most definite form of chronic q fever
moreover , in case of large q fever outbreaks , screening is advisable for patients with these identified risk factors .
valvular surgery , vascular prosthesis , aneurysms , renal insufficiency , and age were significant risk factors for the development of chronic q fever in patients with proven cases . in the analysis of all patients with chronic q fever cases , nonhematologic malignancy also seemed to be a risk factor ; however , this could not be reproduced in the subanalyses of the more definite cases ( e.g. , proven and probable cases ) .
patient risk factors identified in the analysis of the proven cases , representing the most definite chronic q fever cases , were valvular surgery ( or 43.6 , 95% ci 4.70405 ) , vascular prosthesis ( or 26.8 , 95% ci 4.88147 ) , aneurysm ( or 25.9 , 95% ci 4.55147 ) , renal insufficiency ( or 16.0 , 95% ci 2.06123 ) , and age ( or 1.06 , 95% ci 1.021.11 ) .
