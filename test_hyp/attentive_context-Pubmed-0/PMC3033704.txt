in the present study , we have shown that a protease mediated elution increased the recovery of cohesin and apc / c from antibody - conjugated affinity beads by a factor of 2 to three . hence , while acid elution was found to be less efficient , a simple predigestion for 1560 min was sufficient for greatly improved if not complete recovery without leading to a significant sample contamination from cleaved antibody peptides .
furthermore , absolute quantification and subsequent stoichiometry determination of the cohesin complex demonstrated the robustness and compatibility of the protease elution method with ap - qms studies . using
applied to the identification of protein complexes in ap - qms studies it has the potential to increase the sensitivity for detecting low abundant interactors , again due to higher recovery compared to acid elution and because of no or only insignificant contamination from cleaved antibody peptides compared to standard on - bead digestion .
we show by labelfree and absolute quantification that a short 1560 min predigestion with lysc ( modified on - bead digestion termed protease elution ) is 2- to 3-fold more efficient than the acid elution protocols . using 19 reference peptides generated with our etep strategy,(31 ) of which 6 are specific for stag1 and stag2 ,
