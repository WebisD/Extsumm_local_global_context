the results of our prior studies showed isolation of a high number of vre isolates from water and sewage ( 9 , 10 ) .
the level of antibiotics in animal product , in turn , may be due to treatment regimens used for infections in animals .
all of our isolates were susceptible to tetracycline , in comparison with the results from peters and colleagues who found a high rate of tetracycline resistance in their strains ( 25 ) .
a high rate of vana containing enterococcus isolates was detected in food samples of chicken ( 9/10 ) and meat ( 10/10 ) in this study .
the mic of the isolates for vancomycin and teicoplanin was  256 g / ml and for gentamicin - resistant isolates it was 1024 g / ml . the results of typing with phplate system showed a diversity of di = 0.78 for the e. faecium population .
in view of the lack of information about vre isolates in food samples , we studied the occurrence of vre in meat , chicken and cheese which were sold in local markets .
almost the same antibiotic resistance was observed for gentamicin ( 95% ) , but only 5% of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol .
