significant breakthroughs in basic research on the pathophysiology of dementing disorders and new innovative models of dementia care hold the promise of reducing the future burden of dementia.1 however , the majority of dementia research is conducted in specialized research centers among patients who represent less than 1% of the patient population with dementia , with ethnic minority groups being largely underrepresented.26 furthermore , the translation of innovative research discoveries into clinical practice typically takes an average of 17 years and the current research infrastructure fails to shorten this translational cycle.7 the national institutes of health s ( nih ) roadmap and the institute of medicine ( iom ) recognized the large gap in translating research innovations from discovery to delivery and recommended  re - engineering of the clinical research enterprise.810 the iom and the nih roadmap recommended the use of complex adaptive system perspectives and information technology to build a localized and cohesive collaboration among the various members of the community , health care systems , and research organizations.810 in response to the iom and the nih recommendations , the regenstrief institute , inc , the indiana university center for aging research ( iucar ) , and the indiana alzheimer disease center have been building a network of health care providers , clinical researchers , and community advocates dedicated to enhancing the quality of life and care of individuals with dementia and the life and care of their informal caregivers .
