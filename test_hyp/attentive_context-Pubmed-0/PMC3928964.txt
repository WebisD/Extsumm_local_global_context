the area under curve and 95% confidence limits were 0.67 ( range 0.620.72 ) for cer(d18:1/16:0)/cer(d18:1/24:0 ) , 0.65 ( range 0.600.71 ) for cer(d18:1/20:0)/cer(d18:1/24:0 ) , and 0.68 ( range 0.630.73 ) for cer(d18:1/24:0)/cer(d18:1/24:1 ) , whereas for ldl - c , these values were 0.55 ( range 0.500.61 ) . finally , the effect of lipid - lowering treatments on ceramides and cerebrosides associated with increased risk of cvd death in statin - nave subjects as well as on ldl - c was evaluated ( figure 4 ) . as a comparison basis ,
longer exposure time , greater subject numbers , and possibly study in patients with cad will be needed to further understand the dynamics of modulation of the risk lipids .
simvastatin 40 mg resulted in a broad lowering of all recorded ceramide and cerebroside species ; however , the magnitude of reduction was clearly lower than that for ldl - c .
effect of ezetimibe ( 10 mg ) ( b ) , simvastatin ( 40 mg ) ( c ) , simvastatin + ezetimibe ( 40 mg+10 mg ) , ( d ) and pcsk9 loss - of - function mutation ( r46l ) ( e ) on cad mortality risk lipids . for evaluation of ezetimibe and simvastatin effects on these putative risk lipids
