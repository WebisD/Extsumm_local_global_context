for every increase of 20 pigs at a fair , the odds ratio of iav infection in the pigs increased by 1.27 times ( table 2 ) .
pre - fair tag - in and/or weigh - in events were rather common with 23 out of 40 ( 57.5% ) of the enrolled fairs holding one of these events .
the results of the current study provide the first look at fair - level risk factors associated with iav infections in swine at agricultural fairs .
could not be associated with county population , county swine inventory and number of people attending the fair ( table 1 ) . all iav - positive fairs and 27 of 30 ( 90% ) negative fairs were mixed sex ( barrows and gilts ) market swine exhibitions .
, we investigate fair specific risk factors contributing to the emergence of influenza a virus in exhibition swine that could be altered to mitigate the risk of iav transmission in these settings .
influenza a virus was recovered from pigs at 10 of the 40 fairs included in the investigation . the presence or absence of iav infection among the pigs at the fairs
these data provide a critical first step toward developing effective iav mitigation strategies in swine populations that benefit fairs , exhibitors , visitors and the swine industry .
