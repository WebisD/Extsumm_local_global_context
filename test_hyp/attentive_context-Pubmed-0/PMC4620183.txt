hence , the tgri kinase inhibitor - based treatment may possibly uphold chemosensitivity in resistant colon cancer cells .
our aim was to investigate the mirnas ( oncogene or tumor suppressor ) , whose expression might be altered due to inhibition of tgf- signaling pathway .
in this study , we evaluated the effect of a tgf- receptor kinase inhibitor , sd-208 , on some potential onco / suppressor - mirnas expression in crc .
the expression of mir-135b significantly was down - regulated either in cell culture ( a ) or developed tumors ( b ) in sd-208 groups compared to controls prediction of the target genes of mir-135b using bioinformatics analysis in order to determine the biological function of the down - regulated mirna , mir-135b , we further predicted the putative downstream targets of this mirna .
overall , we primarily predicted that combination of sd-208 and one anticancer drug such as 5-fu , may show stronger inhibition of colon tumor cell growth by modification of onco - mirs .
the receptor kinase inhibitor sd-208 may partially inhibit colon tumorigenesis as well as chemoresistance by alteration of mirnas .
we focused our attention on mir-135b because it was the only mirna affected by sd-208 either in vitro or in vivo . in silico analysis using targetscan ( http://www.targetscan.org/ ) showed that mir-135b potentially targets transcripts encoding known tumor - suppressor factors , such as apc ( adenomatosis polyposis coli ) , foxo1 ( forkhead transcription box1 ) , runx1 ( runt - related transcription factor 1 ) and esrra ( estrogen - related receptor alpha ) .
