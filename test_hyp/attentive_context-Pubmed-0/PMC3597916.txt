we describe a patient with hyponatremia caused during the treatment with the antiepileptic drug , i.e. , sodium valproic acid ( vpa ) .
the clinical course indicated that vpa contributed to an siadh6 ) . to our knowledge , this is a rare case of example in the medical literature in english which shows an association between vpa and siadh .
syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone ( siadh ) , also known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis ( siad ) , is one of the most common causes of hyponatremia1 ) .
he had suffered from generalized tonic clonic epilepsy that occurred after a craniectomy due to right epidural hematoma .
therefore , we suggest that patients who have high risk of hyponatremia are recommended to measure the baseline electrolyte levels before starting therapy with sodium valproate16 ) , and to monitor for electrolyte levels throughout the full course of treatment .
sodium valproic acid ( vpa ) , known as a carboxylic acid , is being used for an anti - epileptic in idiopathic and symptomatic generalized epilepsies and for some symptomatic focal epilepsies as well as trigeminal neuralgia , migraine and bipolar disorders4 ) .
