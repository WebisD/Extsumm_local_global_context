we have therefore used h - mrs to evaluate the effects of gh as a caspase inhibitor on hypoxic - ischemic injury in neonatal rat brains .
our results also suggest that gh , as a caspase inhibitor , can have therapeutic value in neuroprotective effect of hypoxic - ischemic brain injury .
recently h - mrs has been used as a quantitative noninvasive assessment tool in monitoring of brain development and in the diagnosis of neurologically damaged infants ( 3 - 5 ) .
the lipid peak in the h - mr spectrum has been reported to be a marker for apoptosis during hypoxic - ischemic injury ( 14 ) .
taken together , these findings suggest that gh exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral hypoxic - ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptosis , especially in the early stage after insult .
lipid / naa ratio and lipid / cr ratio were not significantly changed by ip administration of gh . because gh does not usually cross the blood - brain barrier , ip administration of gh
we found that the lipid / naa ratio was significantly lower in rats administered gh by the icv and icv / ip routes , that lipid / cr ratio was significantly lower in rats administered gh by the icv , and that the degree of morphologic changes in the brain was significantly correlated with the lipid / naa and lipid / cr ratios . in our results ,
