we 
 hypothesize that the absence of a correlation between no production and inos 
 expression indicates that different cell types are involved in inos expression , 
 and that controlling no production and inducing nos may represent valuable strategies 
 in the prevention of benign tissue transitioning into well - differentiated 
 malignant ovarian tumors .
the aim of the present study was to 
 identify differences between inos expression and the local 
 production of no in patients with varying stages and grades of 
 ovarian cystic tumors .
in this study , increased expression of 
 inos and increased production of no metabolites were detected in the tumor 
 microenvironment of ovarian cancer samples compared to benign and nonneoplastic 
 ovarian tissue samples . for ovarian cancer samples , inos expression correlated with 
 the extent of tumor differentiation and intracystic no metabolite levels 
 correlated with the tumor stage .
differences in inos expression between 
 nonneoplastic , benign and malignant ovarian neoplasias suggest a role for no in 
 ovarian carcinogenesis .
in addition , positive inos expression in ovarian 
 carcinoma had been identified as a positive disease - related survival indicator 
 , and was found to be consistent with the high levels of inos activity and 
 no production of nonmetastatic cells versus metastatic cells . in 
 contrast to our findings , a separate study found that patients with advanced ovarian serous 
 tumors express inos and cox-2 and experience a shorter disease - free interval 
 and survival rate .
