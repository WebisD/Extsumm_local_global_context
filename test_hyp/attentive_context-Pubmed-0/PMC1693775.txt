distribution of primary types of metastatic solid tumor   response evaluation of measurable nodules ( > 14 mm ) assessed by the who and the recist criteria   response evaluation of patients assessed by the who and the recist criteria   impact of the presence of new nodules in the patient s global response evaluation assessed by the recist criteria   bold type indicates evaluations in which a new nodule was the sole criterion for disease progression .
intra - individual distribution of response evaluation of pulmonary metastases by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) group criteria .  
we submitted each pulmonary nodule individually , as if it were a solitary metastasis , as well as all the nodules of the same patient combined , to both the who and the recist criteria and compared the response evaluations in each setting .
the selection of one or a few nodules , instead of including all identifiable nodules in the response evaluation , could lead to misevaluation and consequently to the continuity of ineffective treatment or the interruption of potentially effective therapy . the present study used ct to quantify the variation in tumor response of pulmonary metastases of solid tumors of varied histology in individual consecutive patients that were submitted to ct studies in order to evaluate response to chemotherapy .
