this digital radiographic study aims at evaluating the accuracy of fm dimensions in sex determination of south indian adults .
( r ) of the foramen magnum dimensions to assess the accuracy of digital smv radiograph , at first , a formula was derived using discriminant function analysis : gender = [ ( -0.275  ld ) + ( 0.163  td ) + ( 0.461  c ) + ( 0.677  a ) ]  104.89 by applying our data to the derived equation , canonical variables were derived for all the four fm dimensions .
( r ) of the foramen magnum dimensions based on the first day and the second day of observation to evaluate interobserver agreement , r value ( degree of correlation ) was calculated for all the four fm dimensions as measured by all the three observers .
sexual dimorphism in the foramen magnum dimensions foramen magnum measurements in males and females as assessed by all the three observers to evaluate intra - observer agreement , r value ( degree of correlation ) was calculated for all the four fm dimensions as measured by the observers on the first day and second day of observation [ table 3 ] .
