therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate both edn1 gene polymorphisms ( g5665 t [ or lys198asn ] and t-1370 g ) and ednra gene polymorphisms ( c + 70 g and g-231a ) , in the etiopathogenesis of vitiligo .
there was strong linkage disequilibrium between endothelin-1 5665/-1370 ( d = 0.73 , r = 0.405 ) ; and weak linkage disequilibrium between endothelin receptor type a  231/+70 ( d = 0.22 , r = 0.032 ) haplotype analysis of the edn1 and ednra polymorphisms in patients with vitiligo and control subjects
some studies were shown that the presence of t allele was associated with higher edn1 levels , raised systolic blood pressure , and predisposed patients to preeclampsia , suggesting the functional importance of this polymorphism in pregnancy .
characteristics of the patients with vitiligo distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies for patients with vitiligo and control group distribution of ednra c + 70 g genotypes and allele frequencies for patients with vitiligo : impact of presence of associated disease distribution of ednra c + 70 g genotypes and allele frequencies for patients with focal , acrofacial and generalized type of vitiligo distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies for vitiligo patients with leukotrichia and control group levontin 's standardized disequilibrium coefficient ( d ) was calculated as a measure for ld between the studied polymorphisms in the edn1 and ednra genes [ figure 1 ] .
