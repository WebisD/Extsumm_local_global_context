the wand technique registered a highly significantly lower pain level during the needle insertion phase ( z = - 4.064 , p<0.01 ) , with the wand technique having a lower pain level compared to the conventional . during the anesthetic solution delivery phase , the pain level for the wand technique was again highly significantly lower than for the conventional technique ( z = - 3.897 , p<0.01 ) .
computer - controlled anesthesia using the wand appears advantageous for restorative procedures because more teeth are anesthetized with one palatal injection , and without numbness of lips and face , in contrast to multiple conventional buccal anesthetic injections for each tooth .
median scores , minimum and maximum pain rating values after needle insertion , and delivery of anesthetic and tooth preparation time for both conventional and wand techniques , are shown in table 3 .
therefore , the study compared pain levels at needle insertion , during delivery of local anesthetic solution and during tooth preparation , for the conventional syringe technique on the buccal or labial aspect on one side , and the amsa technique with wand local anesthesia application on the other side of the maxilla . a 5-point verbal pain rating scale ( vrs)12,17 was used on 16 patients who were under prosthodontic treatment in the ondokuz mayis university clinic
