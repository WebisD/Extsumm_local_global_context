this opp has been shown to be effective in achieving safe transference of skills to surgeons wishing to develop a service for lcs in their own departments , with acceptable levels of morbidity and mortality .
such a programme , delivering one - to - one training at the point of service delivery , may play a vital role in making safe lcs available widely .
following the programme , all preceptored consultants have performed laparoscopic cases independently . when the respondents were asked to rate various courses available for developing lcs skills on a visual analogue scale ( 0 - 10 ) , the median score for animal workshops ( 5.5 ) , master class alone ( 7.0 ) , websurg ( 7.0 ) , immersion course ( 8.0 ) were all less than the score for the opp ( 8.5 ) .
in 2006 , national institute for health and clinical excellence ( nice ) recommended laparoscopic surgery as an alternative to open surgery for colorectal resections .
a single experienced surgeon ( preceptor ) introduced a preceptorship programme aimed at supporting existing consultants ( preceptees ) wishing to develop laparoscopic colorectal surgery ( lcs ) services at their centre .
