in summary , this is the second case description of late diagnosis of amniotic band syndrome by 3dus .
only three case reports describing the use of 3dus for diagnosing amniotic band syndrome exist in the literature . in two of them ,
we present a case of amniotic band syndrome diagnosed in the 34 week , in which 3dus enabled clear analysis of this malformation , as well as better understanding and better family counseling .
in addition , 3dus allowed better understanding of the pathology , better counseling for the parents , and a good prognosis for the newborn .
this method was shown to be important for proving that the bands had adhered to the limb of the fetus and showing that the prognosis is good when no constriction ring is demonstrated .
three - dimensional ultrasonography ( 3dus ) in rendering mode allows reconstruction of the surface of the fetus , thus , enabling spatial analysis . in cases of fetal malformation ,
this syndrome comprises a variety of anatomical abnormalities among newborns , and is associated with intrauterine struggling by the fetus in the uterus , thereby leading to deformations , malformations , or ruptures .
