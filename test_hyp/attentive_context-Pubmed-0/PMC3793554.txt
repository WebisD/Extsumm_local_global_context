a quantitative measure of mineral loss ( calcium and phosphorus loss ) using a spectrophotometric autoanalyzer was carried out along with scanning electron microscope ( sem ) study of the surface profile before and after exposure to cola drinks and cpp - acp application .
the current study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of cpp - acp paste on the remineralization potential of enamel after its surface was exposed to cola drinks .
hence , preventive advice on their consumption should be given to young children and adolescents since the balance between remineralization and demineralization is the key to progression or reversal of caries , the practice of cola drink intake and use of cpp - acp paste , post - exposure to colas could be used for tipping the balance toward protective remineralization .
the p value of baseline and cpp - acp application group was 0.641 showing no statistical difference in the calcium solubility of enamel of baseline and cpp - acp application group .
an in - situ clinical trial study was carried out after random screening of 1200 school going children and selecting 30 subjects further divided into two groups of 15 subjects each as shown in the flowchart .
