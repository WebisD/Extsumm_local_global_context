, we set out to investigate the cyanide - mediated dimerization of 
 glyoxylate (  glyoxoin reaction  ) with the expectation 
 of chemistry similar to the benzoin reaction .
this facile production of tartrate combined with 
 the known dehydration of tartrate to give oxaloacetate , and its decarboxylation to give pyruvate , potentially , provides an alternate entry into 
 the citric acid cycle based on the  glyoxylate scenario  .
the 
 results of the dhf  glyoxylate reaction presented here 
 are in sharp contrast to the work of sagi et al . ; there , dhf was reacted with glyoxylate in lithium hydroxide 
 at ph 78 to produce dihydroxyacetone and pentulosonic acid 
 by way of six- and seven - carbon tricarboxylate intermediates ( 6 and 15 ) via several decarboxylations
herein we report the results of this investigation : the unanticipated 
 formation of meso- and dl - tartrates 
 ( the formal reduction products of dhf ) rapidly and in high yield ( scheme 1 ) .
( 6 ) this contrasting 
 result demonstrates how even in consistently basic environments , ph 
 may be used to alter the product suite of this reaction , from selective 
 production of pentulosonic acid to selective production of tartrate .
