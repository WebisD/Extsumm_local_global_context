guidelines such as the 2011 st gallen international consensus statement , the 2010 european society for medical oncology ( esmo ) , and american society of clinical oncology ( asco ) guidelines , and the 2011 national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) guidelines include recommendations that , following surgery for early hormone receptor - positive ( hr ) breast cancer , postmenopausal women receive adjuvant aromatase inhibitor ( ai ) treatment either as initial therapy or following 23 years of tamoxifen in order to reduce the risk of recurrence.14 the use of ais as initial therapy , after 23 years of tamoxifen or after 5 years of tamoxifen , has been shown to be more effective than 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen alone , resulting in an improvement in disease - free survival ( dfs ) and a reduction in breast cancer events.3,5 the asco recommendations take into account the fact that locoregional , distant recurrent , and contralateral breast cancer have clinical consequences for breast cancer patients.3 the course of the disease is characterized by peaks in recurrence at 2 years and at 3.5 to 4 years following surgery for breast cancer ; the majority of these recurrences are distant recurrences.6 in the breast international group ( big ) 198 trial , for example , upfront letrozole demonstrated a significant 19% improvement in dfs ( 351 events with letrozole vs 428 events with tamoxifen ; p = 0.003 ) , and a significant 27% reduction in the risk of distant recurrence early on at 25.8 months of follow - up ( 184 events with letrozole vs 249 with tamoxifen ; p = 0.001).7 the early reduction in the risk of distant metastases with letrozole seemed to have had long - term clinical implications on patient outcomes . at 76 months median follow - up in big 198
