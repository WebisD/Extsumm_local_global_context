the aim of this study is to evaluate which factors contribute to elevated uctgf in diabetes . in diabetic mice , we measured the fractional excretion ( fe ) of both endogenous ctgf and recombinant ctgf ( i.e. , not intrarenally derived ctgf ) and examined the renal expression pattern of ctgf .
we submit that urinary ctgf may be a useful biomarker reflecting both glomerular and tubulointerstitial hallmarks of diabetic kidney disease .
previously , we have shown that in the healthy kidney filtered ctgf is almost completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubules by megalin - mediated endocytosis and that impairment of tubular reabsorption results in increased urinary excretion of ctgf ( in close correlation with that of 2 m ) . here
moreover , we examined the association between uctgf and urinary markers in type 1 diabetic patients .
urinary excretion of ctgf was markedly elevated in all diabetic mice ( 999  fmol/24  h ( 1902946 ) , p < 0.0001 ) while in control mice uctgf was measurable in only a minority , with a maximum of 57  fmol/24  h. plasma ctgf was mildly increased in diabetic mice ( 340  pmol / l ( 290370 ) versus 230  pmol / l ( 185295 ) in control mice , p = 0.003 ) . to establish the influence of diabetic kidney disease on the renal handling of ctgf
