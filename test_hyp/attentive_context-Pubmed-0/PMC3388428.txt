here , we review the clinicopathological features , differential diagnosis , and treatments of orbital igg4-related disease on the basis of a meta - analysis of 42 patients including 3 case series studies .
igg4-related diseases are systemic syndromes characterized by elevated serum levels of igg4 and igg4-positive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrative lesions in the body .
orbital igg4-related disease differs from other igg4-related diseases in the body in that it arises from nonglandular lesions and is not associated histologically with obliterative phlebitis .
it was first observed that mikulicz 's disease correlated with igg4-related disease   and later determined that igg4-related disease can occur in any ocular adnexal tissues   .
orbital igg4-related disease has several unique characteristics that distinguish it from other orbital inflammatory conditions .
the median age of patients with orbital igg4-related disease is 59 years ( range : 30 to 86 years ) with a 1  :  1 male - to - female ratio   .
notably , there is a 1  :  3 for bilateral lacrimal lesions similar to finding in mikulicz 's disease .
igg4-related diseases in the body are characterized histologically by obliterative phlebitis ; however , it is rare in orbital igg4-related disease .
although orbital igg4-related disease can occur in men and women of any age , many patients have a history of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis .
