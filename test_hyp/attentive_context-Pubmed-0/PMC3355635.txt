in the following sections , we summarize the characteristics of gelmap and introduce novel features which were newly implemented into the gelmap software package ( gelmap 2.0 ) .
it offers several new possibilities for the web - based publication of reference maps , e.g. , functional annotation of proteins and assignment of multiple proteins to individual  spots  on a gel ( rode et al . , 2011a ) .
originally , maps were exclusively presented in scientific publications in the form of images and long lists of identified proteins which are assigned to the spots on the image using arrows and numbers . about a decade ago , the first web - based resources were developed which offer interactive features in the maps : upon  clicking  on a spot , information on a protein is presented in a small pop - up window which sometimes is linked to further background information in databases ( examples at http://seed.proteome.free.fr/ , http://gabi.rzpd.de/projects/arabidopsis_proteomics/ , http://gene64.dna.affrc.go.jp/rpd/ ) .
the gelmap software package allows complete annotation of ms data corresponding to 2d protein separations . based on its central features  functional annotation of proteins and at the same time annotation of complete sets of proteins identified within each spot  it allows the comprehensive evaluation of gel - based proteome data sets . in the future , the gelmap platform will be used to annotate further projects .
