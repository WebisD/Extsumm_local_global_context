analysis can provide useful 
 information . because simulator exercises improve the muscle strength and endurance , this 
 study aimed to assess the exercise performance capacity improvements of elementary school 
 students .
the obesity group 
 revealed significant differences in the initial stages of the exercise , and the overall pei 
 of the obese group was higher during skiing . * < 0.05 , * * < 0.01 , * * * < 0.001 .

 rates
a heart rate monitor and a stopwatch were used in this study , and 
 cardiorespiratory endurance was calculated by the physical efficiency index ( pei ) formula 
 described below.pei = d/(2  p )  100d : duration

 groups and the 2 exercises were computed through analysis of the biomechanical factors .
