this study is an effort to systematically classify various cvj abnormalities according to their etiological group and to define the importance of precise diagnosis for pretreatment evaluation with multidetector computed tomography ( mdct ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
thus , it is essential that radiologists should be able to make a precise diagnosis of cvj abnormalities , classify them into the appropriate etiological group , and rule out important mimickers on mdct and/or mri ; as this information ultimately helps determine the management of such abnormalities , prognosis , and quality of life of patients .
