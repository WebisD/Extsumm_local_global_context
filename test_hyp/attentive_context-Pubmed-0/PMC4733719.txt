herein , we review and analyze the research progresses in melas in order to help make better diagnosis of this disease .
mitochondrial disease involves a group of rare disorders of mitochondrial dysfunction , which is usually the result of gene mutations in either mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) or nuclear dna ( ndna ) . because mitochondria are the main source of energy production in cells and are present in all tissues except for red blood cells , clinical features manifest typically in tissues with the highest energy requirements including skeletal muscles , brain , myocardium , and endocrine systems .
promisingly , some new research progresses have been made recently , including the characteristic functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) imaging , such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( mrs ) , which can be used to determine the lactate level of brain , and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( 1h - mrsi ) assessment can be used to predict disease severity .
be aware that other diseases may have similar muscle biopsy findings of mitochondrial myopathies ( mm ) , including ragged red fibers ( rrfs ) and cytochrome oxidase ( cox ) negative fibers
mitochondrial myopathy , encephalopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke - like episodes ( melas ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with polygenetic , maternally inherited mutations in mtdna .
