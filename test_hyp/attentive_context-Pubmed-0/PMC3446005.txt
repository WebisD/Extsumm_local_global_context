we measured urinary lactate and creatinine concentrations within the first 6 and 24 hours after birth and determined sensitivity and specificity of the ratio of urinary lactate to creatinine for the early identification of infants in whom hypoxic  ischemic encephalopathy is likely to develop .
we studied 50 consecutive newborn infants with perinatal asphyxia who were born in our hospitals between october 2006 and june 2007 .
our study showed that the urinary lactate / creatinine ratio in newborn infants with asphyxia is useful for predicting the development of hypoxic  ischemic encephalopathy .
there was a significant trend for the ratio to increase with the severity of the hypoxic  ischemic encephalopathy in 24 hours : 1.10.5 in the infants with mild encephalopathy , 1.51.5 in those with moderate encephalopathy , and 23.3 in those with severe encephalopathy .
l / c ratio within six hours after birth in a normal infant , and an infant with asphyxia and hypoxic  ischemic encephalopathy the mean ratio of l / c in urine within 24 hours after birth was 1.50.55 in the infants who subsequently developed hypoxic 
our study shows that urinary l / c ratio , determined by 1h nmr within six hours after birth in infants with perinatal asphyxia , can be used to identify most of the infants who will develop hypoxic
