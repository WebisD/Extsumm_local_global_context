for example , our outreach centre c3 has achieved overall nnmr of 89/1000 , a reduction of 65% in terms of the national facility - based average as computed in 2009 .
this was a huge and difficult task that required proactive thinking and development and implementation of revolutionary ideas given the antecedents of such a struggling low - resource country as nigeria .
the recycled incubator technology ( rit ) and associated outreach concerns in this study have demonstrated the significant capability of nigerian special care baby units ( scbus ) in achieving improved newborn survival .
the aim of this work was to investigate how remedies to some identified issues of concern might have changed practice and overall neonatal survival rate in few hospitals in nigeria .
a further investigation is hence recommended to urgently study the manner of care given to this class of patients , especially in the first 7 days of life , in order to synthesise any possible techniques that might guarantee better survival rate .
an earlier publication to assess the impact of this outreach in 2009 studied performances of the same group of hospitals that were involved in the present analyses .
