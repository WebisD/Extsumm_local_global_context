with increasing volume and diversity of the accumulating data on rna helicases the need arises to integrate the wealth of information in a timely and readily accessible format . to address this issue ,
the structure of the rna helicase database is based on the most recent helicase classification into helicase superfamilies ( sfs ) and families ( 3,14,15 ) . according to sequence and protein structures
this database is a completely restructured version of the dexh / d protein database from 1999 , which covered only a subset of rna helicases ( 10 ) .
we approached the design of the rna helicase database from the view of user who is interested in the fast retrieval of comprehensive information on one or more specific rna helicases , and in examining phylogenetic relations of rna helicases to each other .
therefore , the rna helicase database aims foremost to enable researchers to locate and retrieve comprehensive information about sequence , structure , biochemical and cellular function of rna helicases .
our rationale for incorporating the various routes of access to the individual protein pages is the heterogeneity in the database users , which ranges from researchers looking for updates on information on a helicase that they have long been working on , to those who retrieve the first comprehensive information on a protein they just came across in their research .
