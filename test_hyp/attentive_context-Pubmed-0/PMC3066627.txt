the primary goal of the present exploratory study was to compare the mental health status of a sample of women who experienced a 1st trimester abortion ( up to 12 weeks gestation ) to women who had a 2nd or 3rd trimester abortion ( 13 weeks and beyond ) .
specifically , the difference in intrusion subscale scores was statistically significant and when individual ptsd items were examined , the late - term group was found to report more disturbing dreams , more frequent reliving of the abortion , and more trouble falling asleep .
the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that women who undergo 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions would be more traumatized than their peers who experience 1st trimester abortions as evidenced by significantly higher rates of ptsd symptoms .
( 1 ) do women who have later abortions tend to experience intrusive trauma - related symptoms for a longer duration than women who have earlier abortions due to the nature of late - term abortion procedures ? ( 2 ) are women with abuse histories who may be primed for trauma more prone to experiencing serious trauma symptoms after an abortion and are they less likely to seek needed help and achieve inner peace due to compromised self - esteem , self - blame , or shame ? ( 3 ) are there other mental health problems , such as depression , anxiety , and substance abuse that tend to occur more frequently after later abortion compared to early abortion ? ( 4 ) assuming differences are detected and late - term abortions are identified to be more emotionally taxing on women , who are most at risk for mental health problems and what specific characteristics of 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions make them more traumagenic ? as long as 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions are medical services that are freely available to women residing in the u.s , we have an ethical obligation to more fully understand the mental health risks involved and to convey this information in a sensitive manner to women as they struggle with difficult abortion decisions .
