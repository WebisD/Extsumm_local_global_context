asma is analyzed in various types of gn together with markers such as metalloproteinase and nestin in investigation of tissue remodulation and epithelial - mesenchymal transition . to our best knowledge , this is the first morphometrical study of the correlation of asma expression in gn and renal function at the time of biopsy .
asma expression in interstitium is associated with sc and ccr and consecutively with decrease of renal function .
greater expression of interstitial asma in children and adults was associated with higher grades of ccr and lower absolute values of ccr .
analyzed 27 patients with iga nephropathy who had normal ccr at the time of biopsy , and found that expression of asma in mesangium predicts a progressive decline in renal function . in our study ,
expression of asma in interstitium and in glomeruli were not significantly different between patients with high and normal blood pressure ( 10.714.9% vs. 9.912.6% , p=0.692 ) and ( 13.69.5% vs. 12.97.8% , p=1.00 ) , respectively . in children
the children with high blood pressure had greater expression of asma in interstitium compared to children with low blood pressure ( 10.79.4% vs. 3.74.3% , p=0.014 ) ( figure 2 ) .
