a 43-year - old woman diagnosed with intravenous leiomyomatosis at another hospital was transferred to our hospital .
intracardiac leiomyomatosis should be considered in a female patient presenting with an extensive mass in the right side of the heart , and urgent surgical removal should be performed to avoid possible fatal complications , even if the patient is asymptomatic . as the tumor may move or detach from the central venous system even during operation , intraoperative tee
ariza and colleagues described the first successful two - stage removal of an intracaval mass , with delayed laparotomy after resection of the intracardiac portion of a tumor in 1982 .
we discovered an echogenic linear mass in the pulmonary artery between the arterial bifurcation and both main pulmonary arterial branches ( fig .
extension or embolization into the pulmonary artery or lung metastasis is a very rare complication constituting less than 5% of the reported cases .
another mass in the pulmonary artery was also removed under conventional cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest ( fig .
the uncommon benign tumor usually arises from either the uterine venous wall or uterine leiomyoma , and although it is histologically benign , it can cause fatal cardiovascular complications such as cardiac failure , pulmonary embolization , or sudden death . in previously reported cases describing intracardiac involvement , the tumor extended to the right atrium in 30% of cases , and to the right ventricle in 70% of cases .
