here , we report a unique case of acquired factor v inhibitor in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma presenting with hematuria followed by thrombosis .
a 64-year - old man initially presented to us with complaints of fatigue and joint discomfort for several months prior to december 2008 .
this complex forms on the platelet surface and has limited proteolytic activity , converting prothrombin to thrombin to aid in blood clotting.2,3 acquired inhibitors to factor v were first reported in 195524 and develop in extremely rare cases ( 0.090.29 cases per million persons ) via development of alloantibodies or autoantibodies against factor v. patients with acquired factor v inhibitors generally present with hemorrhagic manifestations .
factor v is a coagulation protein that is present in blood plasma as a single - chain polypeptide ( approximately 80% ) and in platelet alpha - granules ( approximately 20%).1 factor v is cleaved after binding to activated platelets and serves as a cofactor for factor xa in the prothrombinase complex .
the patient presented in this case report had a unique clinical manifestation of acquired factor v inhibitor in that thrombosis occurred after factor v was no longer detectable by an assay measuring bethesda units ; however , the patient still exhibited coagulopathy with high prothrombin time and inr , suggesting the continued presence of a small amount of factor v inhibitor . at first presentation ,
