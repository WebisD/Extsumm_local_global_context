this study was done in a country where national guidelines suggest that tests should be done for -haemolytic streptococcus a when treating acute pharyngotonsillitis , which must be considered when the generalizability of the results is evaluated . to conclude , even among adult patients who suffered from recurrent pharyngotonsillitis episodes , the overwhelming majority of the acute pharyngotonsillitis episodes were mild and only few resulted in a medical consultation , with female gender , chronically infected tonsils , and having severe throat pain increasing the consultation rate .
, we sought patient- and episode - related factors that would explain whether or not the patient made a medical visit for acute sore throat both before and after tonsillectomy .
study design was a secondary analysis of two randomised controlled trials exploring the effect of tonsillectomy in reducing further episodes of sore throat in adult patients with recurrent pharyngotonsillitis .
that the patient had had severe throat pain during the first 7 days correlated significantly with the medical consultation ( hr 4.3 , 95% ci 1.018.5 ) ( table 2 ) . in contrast , having had moderate throat pain , fever , the presence of other respiratory symptoms , and whether the episode was pre- or postoperative were not associated with the medical consultation .
