the objective of our study was to determine the impact of knee position and quadriceps contraction on patellofemoral indices measured on mri .
performing mri of the knee in 30 of flexion helps to reduce the confounding effect of quadriceps contraction and may result in more reliable radiological assessment of the patellofemoral joint .
patellofemoral indices measured on mri are affected by the position of the knee and quadriceps muscle activity . with the knee in extension and the quadriceps contracted , as may occur in an anxious patient , there was a tendency towards abnormal patellofemoral measurements in our cohort of asymptomatic patients .
the mean bisect offset angle in the flexed position increased from a normal range of 56% and 57% when the quadriceps were relaxed or contracted , respectively , to an abnormal value of 65% with the knee extended and quadriceps contracted ( p=0.012 ) .
mri evaluation of the knee forms an integral part of the investigation of young patients with knee pain .
we , therefore , recommend , when investigating patients with suspected patellofemoral pathology , mri of the knee should be performed in 30 of flexion to obtain a more accurate view of the patellofemoral joint and avoid the confounding effects of quadriceps contraction .
