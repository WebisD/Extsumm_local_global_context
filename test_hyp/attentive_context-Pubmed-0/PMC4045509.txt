this study provides a platform for using vbus as cost - effective approach to breast cancer detection in the judicious screening of asymptomatic women with excessive mammographic density , in whom the greatest risk is between screening mammography examinations .
when we considered the mean breast cancer size in our positive test subject group , 14.3  mm ( n = 42 ) , we extrapolated a theoretical missed cancer size of 29.2  mm at 9 months in mammographically dense breasts , representative of stage 2 or greater disease . in control subjects ,
the positive predictive value was 20.43% ( 95% ci : 12.78%30.05% ) with a breast cancer prevalence rate of 0.60% ( 95% ci : 12.78%30.05% ) .
the positive predictive value of vbus was 80.77% ( 95% ci : 67.46%90.36% ) , with a breast cancer prevalence rate of 1.25% ( 95% ci : 0.91%1.69% ) . the odds ratio of breast cancer in mammographically dense breasts determined by vbus was 2.65 ( 95% ci : 1.544.57 ; p = 0.0004 ) .
our analysis relied on the following assumptions : ( 1 ) global centers for medicare and medicaid reimbursement rate of breast ultrasound of $ 71 ; ( 2 ) estimated mean doubling time of a missed cancer of 250 days at the 95th percentile   . according to previously cited cancer kinetics models , a missed breast cancer should be clinically evident within 9 months .
