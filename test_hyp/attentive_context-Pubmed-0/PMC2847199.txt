the exciting part of identifying metabolic - enzyme mutations in specific cancers is that they are 
the identification of sdh and fh mutations has already led to the development of cell permeable -ketoglutarate derivates with the potential to suppress the transforming effects of these mutations through reactivation of the eglns .
disruptions of oxygen - sensing pathways can lead to the development of certain forms of cancer   .
oxygen - sensing mechanisms enable the cell to adapt to low oxygen environments and are also critical for normal development and apoptosis .
the vhl disease is caused by inactivating germline mutations of the vhl gene and predisposes to a variety of tumours including haemangioblastoma of the retina and nervous system , clear cell renal carcinomas ( rcc ; the most common form of kidney cancer ) and phaeochromocytomas / paragangliomas , tumours of the sympathoadrenal nervous system .
the recently identified mutations in the metabolic / mitochondrial enzymes ( fh , sdhb / c / d , idh1/2 ) provide convincing evidence that alteration in cellular metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer .
hence , 43 years later we are beginning to learn the depth of otto warburg s foresight that ( in his words )  cancer cells should be interpreted as a mitochondrial dysfunction and that  the prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normal body cells by a fermentation of sugar  .
