during a period of two months , these two patients underwent 13 and 15 csf cytology examinations , which yielded positive results in 6 and 10 of the tests , respectively .
continuous follow - up using csf cytology is essential for determining clinical course , and the results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and radiological findings .
of the 385 specimens , 132 were diagnosed as positive for malignancy and 27 were suspicious for malignancy , for a total of 159 specimens considered to have a positive diagnosis of malignancy . among the 42 patients ,
the positive malignancy diagnosis rates in the other 31 patients ranged from 4.5% to 87.5% , and the mean positive rate was 41.3% .
lung was the most common primary site with 22 cases , followed by breast with 6 cases .
although the sensitivity of csf cytology as a diagnostic tool in patients with cns metastasis was lower than expected , even with the icc , we consider this result to be important and instructive as negative results should not be ignored or regarded as tumor regression . alternatively ,
between july 2010 and june 2013 , 385 csf cytology samples were collected from 42 patients with the presence of a metastatic tumor confirmed by at least two histologic or cytological studies .
