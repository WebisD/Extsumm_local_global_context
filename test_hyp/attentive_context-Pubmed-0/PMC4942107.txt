this manuscript is a follow - up on a previous study in which we evaluated the biological impact of a different subset of hphcs . as part of our workflow to assess cytotoxicity in vitro , we initially evaluated the potencies of a selection of 15 hphc 's , using an impedance - based real - time cellular analysis ( rtca ) system which allowed us to establish dose - ranges , suitable for subsequent hcs analysis ( figure 1 ) . a toxicological hcs assessment
, we have demonstrated the applicability of combining a real - time cell analyzer ( rtca ) with a high content screening ( hcs ) platform to assess the impact of exposure to single cs constituents on human lung epithelial cells .
for example , dna double - strand breaks were evaluated using an antibody - based identification of histone h2ax phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) were quantified using a cell - permeable superoxide sensitive dye . because lung epithelial cells represent the first biological barrier against inhaled toxicants , including cigarette smoke , we utilized primary bronchial epithelial cells as an in vitro model to profile the effect of hphcs published by the united states food and drug administration .
