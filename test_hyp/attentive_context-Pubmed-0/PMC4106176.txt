in summary , many studies in animal models have shown effects of pd pathology on the adult generation of newborn neurons , in part with conflicting results owing to different experimental conditions .
data on adult neurogenesis in human pd are still scarce but will be important to validate experimental findings . in the future , novel techniques will facilitate analysis of adult neurogenesis in animals and in patients   . in addition , the discussed models of impaired neurogenesis in pd will serve as drug screening platform to validate drugs aimed at modifying the course of pd .
, the presence of neural stem cells and active neurogenesis throughout life serves as an attractive model to study pd disease pathology and to test neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment approaches .
therefore , in the following review , we will elaborate current knowledge about adult neurogenesis in pd patients and pd models , and we will discuss how these findings may help to understand and to treat pd .
detailed analysis of the tissue revealed signs of host - to - graft propagation of lb pathology   .
in addition , transgenic models provide an insight into the disease mechanism of relevant genes and proteins .
