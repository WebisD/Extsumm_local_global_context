a survey was created that included 15 different clinical case scenarios representative of the class i , iia , iib , and iii indications for ppm implantation stated in the 2008 aha / acc / hrs guidelines.2 ) members of the korean and japanese societies of cardiology ( including electrophysiologists , non - electrophysiologists , and cardiac surgeons ) were asked to respond to a questionnaire to determine whether or not they would implant a ppm in each of the clinical scenarios presented to them .
however , for the group 2 , the japanese physicians were significantly more likely than the korean physicians to implant a ppm ( 48% vs. 37% , p<0.001 ) ; corresponding rates were 40% vs. 19% ( p<0.001 ) for group 3 and 36% vs. 18% ( p<0.001 ) for the group 4 scenarios .
, there was no significant difference in the decision to implant a ppm between korean and japanese physicians .
these differences in physician decision making probably contribute to the small number of ppms implanted in korea , as compared with japan .
we conducted a survey among physicians in japan and korea to determine what factors may be influencing their decision to implant ppms .
