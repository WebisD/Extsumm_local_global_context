the study also attempted to establish the relationship between the psychophysiological components i.e. rapm scores with the latencies and amplitudes of p300 , cnv and mlr . in our study p300 component of erp showed significant increase after 36 h of sd in terms of latency .
the present study used a novel approach to evaluate the psychophysiological and functional measures of cognition together .
thus , cognitive impairment after total sd is an assembly of dysfunctions in different regions of brain rather than being a single component ; and the event related ( p300 and cnv ) and evoked potentials ( mlr ) can analyze the situation real - time , which is further confirmed by rapm scores , the psychophysiological assessment tool .
it also shows that total sd involves deficit in sensory perception as well as inefficiency in motor responses , which leads to cognitive impairment in an integrative manner , as is evident from significant changes in p300 , cnv , mlr and rapm scores .
this is indicative of reduced ability of concentration , discrimination of a target stimulus in a train of non - target stimuli ; matching the stimulus against the memory representation of the relevant ( target ) stimuli and decision making ( whether the presented stimulus is a target one ) .
