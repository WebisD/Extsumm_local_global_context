because the major mrsa clones isolated in 19942003 are more resistant to antimicrobial drugs , especially fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole , than those obtained in 1992 and 1993 , this shift may be caused by selective pressure from indiscriminate use of antimicrobial drugs .
the first mrsa isolate with the type iv sccmec element in our hospital appeared as early as 1992 . the sccmec element carried by predominant mrsa clones changed from type iv to type iii sccmec element during the period 19922003 at ntuh .
we analyzed all 140 mrsa isolates we obtained during a previous study ( 2 ) and 50 other isolates selected from our collection of nosocomial mrsa isolates obtained in 2003 .
in addition , st254-iv mrsa isolates have been found in germany and the united kingdom ( 12 ) . whether st254-iv mrsa isolates in our study
we demonstrate that the predominant mrsa clone at ntuh in early 1990s had the type iv sccmec element . however , the predominant mrsa clones at ntuh from 1994 to 2003 had the type iii sccmec element .
although the first study of mrsa with the type iv sccmec element reported that this element was found in community - acquired mrsa ( ca - mrsa ) ( 5 ) , some studies have reported mrsa isolates with this element in a hospital environment ( 12 ) . however , to our knowledge , these reports did not demonstrate that mrsa isolates with the type iv sccmec element became predominant among all mrsa isolates in an institution , especially before the mid-1990s .
