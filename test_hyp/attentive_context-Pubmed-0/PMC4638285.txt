we verified the combined effects of ctd and stress on the reproductive and behavioral 
 function in mature male mice by a non - invasive administration method .
the finding that one of the metabolites of imidacloprid ( imi ) seriously disturbs mapk / erk 
 signaling compared to imi itself   suggests that 
 the safety coefficient ( 100 ) for calculating the acceptable daily intake is not 
 satisfactory . taking the results of the present study as an example , it is clear that 
 further research is needed to identify the toxicant mechanisms of environmental chemicals in 
 order to protect humans and animals with high sensitivities under stressed conditions .
behavioral effect of combined exposure of ctd and stress in the open field activity 
 in the non - stressed and stressed groups .
the gels could not 
 completely cloak the bad palatability of ctd as reported earlier using similar gels mixed 
 with an aromatase inhibitor , anastrozole ; 
 however , the gel consumption observed in combined exposure groups was enough for maintaining 
 the health of the mice . in our preliminary experiments
ctd also 
 enhanced the anxiety - like behaviors in a dose - dependent manner , and in the non - stressed 
 condition , the difference was significant in the ctd-10 and ctd-250 groups compared to the 
 ctd-0 group .
