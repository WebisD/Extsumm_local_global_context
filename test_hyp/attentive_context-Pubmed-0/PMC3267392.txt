these observations led to the hypothesis that the high gc content of hodgkinia resulted from the retention of a gc mutational bias that was present in its free - living alphaproteobacterial ancestor ( mccutcheon et al .
2010 ) . to help clarify the roles of mutational biases and selection on the gc content of the hodgkinia genome
the mutational results reported here would predict that a lineage of hodgkinia in which the selective restraints on elevated gc content were severely reduced or eliminated would have a genomic gc content as low as , or possibly lower than , 37% .
hodgkinia is found as a symbiont throughout the cicada lineage ( data not shown ) , and it will be of interest to examine the gc contents and mutational biases of hodgkinia across the diversity of cicadas . if gc - poor lineages of hodgkinia are found , then it may be possible to narrow the list of possible selective forces responsible for the elevated gc levels in hodgkinia from d. semicincta , by considering factors such as the environmental conditions and population structures of the insect hosts .
2009 ) . that the gc content at third positions of 4-fold degenerate codons ( gc4 ) in hodgkinia is higher than the overall gc content in the genome ( 62.5% vs. 58.4% ) seemed to support this hypothesis , as these positions are expected to be under little or no selection for protein - coding sequence and were therefore thought to more clearly reflect the mutational biases inherent in hodgkinia 's replication machinery ( mccutcheon et al .
