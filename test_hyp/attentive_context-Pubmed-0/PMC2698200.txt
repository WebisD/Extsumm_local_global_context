, we describe the clinicopathologic features of ten cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with heterotopic ossification in addition to a review of previously published data and a discussion on the histogenesis of bone formation .
our results indicate that heterotopic ossification in primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma occurs via an intramembranous bone formation and osteopontin has more osteoblastic activity in fibroblastic stroma surrounding the area of bony trabecullae
( 1 ) . to our knowledge , however , only 11 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with heterotopic ossification have been reported in the literature , and the isolated cases described in these reports involved ossification in bronchogenic carcinoma ( 1 - 11 ) .
we detected immunoreactivity against tgf-1 , osteopontin , osteocalcin and runx2 in the tumor cells and fibroblastic stroma surrounding the area of ossification .
positive reactivity for p53 was observed in six of eight patients ( 75% ) , and the index of positivity in the tumor cells ranged from 30 to 90% ( mean 55.8% ) .
pulmonary adenocarcinoma is a common malignancy that is prone to calcification , although bone formation in primary lung adenocarcinoma is extremely rare .
ten cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with heterotopic ossification diagnosed in the department of pathology at the samsung medical center in seoul , korea , between 2003 and 2007 were considered ( table 1 ) .
