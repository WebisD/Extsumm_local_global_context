in conclusion , we have shown that , in a small cohort of kidney transplant recipients who developed nodat , sitagliptin was efficacious as a single agent or in combination with other glucose - lowering medications .
sitagliptin was efficacious with a majority of patients meeting a goal hba1c < 7% . specifically , sitagliptin alone was adequate to improve and maintain glycemic control in a majority of patients ( 19/22 ) for 12 months after sitagliptin initiation , consistent with its efficacy in the nontransplant population   .
eight patients continued on sitagliptin for the duration of the study ( 44.9  10.9 months ) but required addition of other diabetes medications to maintain glycemic control ( oral agents , n = 4 ; insulin , n = 4 ) .
sitagliptin was also well tolerated and renal function and immunosuppressant levels and dosing were stable during 12 months of therapy .
hemoglobin a1c was significantly lower at baseline in patients who were able to continue on sitagliptin alone for the duration of the study ( n = 9 ) compared to patients who discontinued sitagliptin and were switched to more aggressive diabetes management ( n = 5 ) ( figure 4(d ) ) .
