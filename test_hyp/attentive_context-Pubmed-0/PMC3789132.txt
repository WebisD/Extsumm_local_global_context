the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two weight - reducing dietary approaches ( l - cho vs h - cho diets ) on attention , information processing , reaction time , short - term memory and executive function in overweight or obese men and women over a 6-month period .
in conclusion , these findings suggest that individuals participating in a 6-month behavioral weight - loss program randomized to either a l - cho ( that is , dr atkins ' new diet revolution ) or a h - cho ( that is , dietary guidelines for americans ) diet experienced similar effects on cognitive performance .
the main findings from this study are : ( 1 ) weight loss has neither a positive or negative effect on cognitive function and ( 2 ) l - cho and h - cho weight - loss diets have similar effects on cognitive performance .
this study investigated the cognitive effects of l - cho and h - cho weight - reducing diets over a 6-month period .
however , there was a significant main effect for time ( p<0.0001 ) and a significant interaction between time and condition ( p=0.0002 ) for urinary ketones . compared with the h - cho group ,
