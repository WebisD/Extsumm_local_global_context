if we compare these data with the results for engineering , which has 24% of all stem graduates each year and 14% of the stem faculty , we see a great disparity in the degree to which faculty in these two disciplines seek funding for instructional changes in their classrooms .
table 2 also shows that 41% of all stem graduates in the united states are biology majors , and 22% of all u.s .
in addition to the tues and rcn - ube programs within nsf , there are a variety of other funding opportunities for faculty and students in the life sciences , including the following : 
 the hhmi science education alliance helps 
bring good ideas in science education to a broader audience by offering educators models of research - based curricula developed to engage college students in true scientific discovery as early as possible in their academic careers 
we chose to compare engineering and biology undergraduate education because both are undergoing major reorganization ; engineering due to the pressures from the accreditation board for engineering and technology , and biology due to the pressures of the association of american medical colleges / howard hughes medical institute report scientific foundations for future physicians ( aamc / hhmi , 2009 ) , as well as the vision and change initiative ( aaas , 2011 ) .
