however , cardiac metastasis is diagnosed in less than 1% of patients with malignant melanoma because less than 10% of these patients present with cardiac symptoms.1 - 3 ) identification of cardiac metastasis from melanoma usually means that the patient is suffering systemic metastasis . unlike typical cardiac metastasized patients , we report a first case of a patient with a metastatic malignant melanoma in the heart without an identifiable primary source or additional metastasis in korea .
chest computed tomography showed a large amount of pericardial effusion and a mass in the right atrium ( ra ) ( fig .
cardiac mri also revealed a large mass surrounding ascending aorta spread into transverse sinus and around pulmonary trunk ( fig .
considering the risk of open heart surgery and poor prognosis of extensive cardiac metastasis , pericardial window operation and epicardial mass biopsy were performed to relieve symptoms and confirm the pathological diagnosis . pathological analysis including immunohistochemistry revealed the final diagnosis to be malignant melanoma ( fig .
as only few reports about cardiac metastasis of malignant melanoma without cutaneous origin have been published , we are uncertain if conservative surgery is associated with prolonged survival and if the role of surgery for survival is worth further investigation .
