in this study , we found that nova1 was frequently and highly expressed in various subtypes of t / nk - cell lymphomas , with about 60% of t / nk - cell lymphoma cases showing high nova1 expression , whereas only a small number of t cells expressed nova1 in the hyperplastic palatine tonsils .
nova1 expression may be a new biomarker for t / nk - cell lymphomas and should be studied as a possible therapeutic target for this type of lymphoma .
the expression level ( score ) of nova1 was higher in tumor cells of t / nk - cell lymphomas when compared to normal t cells of tonsil tissues ( mean score , 209 vs. 7 ; p<.001 ; non - parametric m - w ) ( fig .
however , in contrast to t / nk cells , nova1 might not be involved in b cell lesions , either malignant lymphomas or non - neoplastic b cells , as shown in our studies . among subtypes of t
our previous study   revealed high expression of nova1 in activated t cells and the present study also confirmed that finding .
according to the specific subtypes of t / nk - cell lymphomas , the expression level of nova1 in tumor cells varied ( p=.011 ; k - w ) .
