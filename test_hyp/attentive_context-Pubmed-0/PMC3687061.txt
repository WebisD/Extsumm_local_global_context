we present a case of a carcinosarcoma located in the maxillary sinus that was is aggressive and displayed a high recurrence rate even when a multimodality therapeutic approach was adopted .
carcinosarcoma ( also known as pseudosarcoma , pseudosarcomatous squamous cell carcinoma , pleomorphic carcinoma , and spindle cell carcinoma ) is a highly malignant tumor characterized by dual malignant histologic differentiation of the epithelial component consisting of a focally squamous cell carcinoma and a mesenchymal component having a sarcomatoid stroma .
carcinosarcoma may arise in any squamous epithelium of the body , however its occurrence is extremely rare in the sinonasal cavity [ 3 - 13 ] .
a 62-year - old male was admitted to the emergency room due to uncontrolled epistaxis and complaining of swelling and tenderness in the right cheek .
also , before aggressive multimodal therapy is initiated , patients should be counseled concerning the tendency for aggressive patient behavior , poor prognosis , and likelihood of recurrence .
carcinosarcoma is a biphasic tumor composed of dual components : an epithelial portion with squamous cell carcinoma and sarcomatoid lesion .
a surgical resection with postoperative chemoradiation therapy was planned and the patient underwent a total maxillectomy on the right side .
