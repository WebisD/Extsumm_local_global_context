one of the guidelines in the routine management of pregnant women in our centre is to send blood sample of every pregnant woman with clinical diagnosis of malaria to the laboratory for examination for malaria parasite .
the outcome of this would help to strengthen the use of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria by the pregnant women during routine antenatal care in this centre being a new and emerging teaching hospital .
the prevalence of malaria in pregnancy among women who had single dose of iptp and those who had double dose of iptp among the women who used iptp and had malaria in pregnancy , the prevalence of malaria was higher in those who had a single dose of the drug compared to those who had two doses with p = 0.0001 .
the national iptp coverage is about 16.6% in the urban areas and 8.5% in the rural areas while the coverage is 14% for the south - west region.13 ipt of malaria with sp ( 500 mg sulphadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine ) was given in the second and third trimester by direct observed therapy ( dot ) under the supervision of nurses at the antenatal clinic and usually documented in the case record along with the number of doses the pregnant women had taken .
