we have performed a retrospective analysis of 119 patients with non - metastatic non - nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck admitted between 2008 and 2014 to our clinical oncology center ( jorjani cancer center , emam hossein hospital , tehran , iran ) .
, patients with oral cavity cancer had significantly better prognosis with surgical approaches ( 22 ) . in conclusion , our study seems to be the first that investigated outcome of iranian patients with head and neck cancer and factors influencing it .
mean os of patients with t1/t2 tumors was higher than patients with t2/t3 tumors and this difference was statistically significant ( 59 months vs. 47 months , respectively : p = 0.039 ) . in terms of efs ,
in a recently published randomized trial , iyer et al . has shown that there have appeared to be either no difference in outcome , nor a slight advantage favoring primary surgery plus rt compared with concurrent chemort for patients with advanced , nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( 5-year os rate was 45% and 35% , respectively p = 0.262 ) . only in subset analysis
