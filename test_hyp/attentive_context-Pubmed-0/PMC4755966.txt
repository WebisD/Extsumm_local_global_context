therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the effect 
 of combining passive muscle stretching and whole body vibration on the spasticity , 
 functional strength and balance of children and adolescents with spastic cp .
p < 0.05 summarize the pre - and post - intervention measurement values of cg and eg . in 
 the immediate effect of eg ,
after the 6-week treatment , all the evaluated items 
 significantly improved in eg , and the mas scores of the hamstrings and soleus of the 
 stronger side and ftsst improved in cg . in the comparison of the groups , the mas scores of 
 the quadriceps and hamstrings of both sides , and soleus of the stronger side were more 
 significantly decreased by eg than by cg .
the study was designed as a two - period cross - over trial in which all subjects received 
 both , passive muscle stretching alone as a control group ( cg ) , and a combination of passive 
 muscle stretching and whole body vibration as an experimental group ( eg ) , as shown in fig .
cg : control group ; eg : experimental group ; pms : passive muscle stretching ; wbv : whole 
 body vibration .
