the answers to these questions belong to epidemiologists and raise several methodological issues : what kind of study should be used , which health outcomes should be investigated , how to assess exposure , and how to control for confounding factors ? in this paper , we performed a literature review of the published studies investigating the health of population exposed to industrial air pollution around major industrial sites .
the objectives were ( 1 ) to identify the reasons why studies were performed , ( 2 ) to list the health outcomes that have been investigated , ( 3 ) to describe the study designs that have been used , and ( 4 ) to describe and discuss the exposure assessments .
the initial search equation was ( (  air pollutants  [ mesh ] or  air pollution  [ mesh ] ) and  epidemiology  [ subheading ] ) or ( ( air pollution [ title / abstract ] or air pollutants [ title / abstract ] ) and ( epidemiology or epidemio * or  case control study  or cohort or 
finally , intervention studies documenting the possible improvements of the health status of the population after the closure of a plant , or a change in the industrial processes , would be highly informative to improve the knowledge and to help for management ( a change in the industrial processes that have been shown to have positive effect in the environment and the health status could be reproduced elsewhere ) .
