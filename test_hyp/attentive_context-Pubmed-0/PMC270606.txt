however , before clinicians can administer new therapies that utilize new knowledge on the actions of coagulation cascade components , and hence improve the outcomes of their patients , several gaps in our current understanding must be addressed .
the above - mentioned concerns aside , the clinician should be excited about the expanding knowledge of the role of coagulation cascade components in modifying the inflammatory response
the potential key role of proteins that were originally believed to be exclusively involved in coagulation in the inflammatory response provides an exciting potential mechanism(s ) for modification through the application of new therapies .
the accompanying review by riewald and ruf   outlines the available information on the possible steps involving some of the various proteins that are common to both coagulation and inflammation .
the relationship between the clotting cascade and the promotion or inhibition of the anti - inflammatory response continues to be defined through basic research .
the complexity of the multiple actions of the proteins in both inflammation and coagulation should excite the clinician with regard to potential new therapies that may be beneficial via activation of one or both of the concurrent pathways .
this example illustrates that a broader knowledge of the impact of altering the coagulation/ inflammatory response will be required before clinicians can comfortably utilize new therapies in patient care .
