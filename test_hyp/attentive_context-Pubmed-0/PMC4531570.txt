herein , our experience of two recently encountered cases of ptld following a lung transplantation , which demonstrated an aggressive clinical behavior , is reported , with a review of the literature .
post - transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( ptld ) is a serious , often fatal complication after solid organ transplantation .
the first case was confirmed as polymorphic , and was treated by conservative means by adjusting the immunosuppressant and anti - viral agent used to treat the accompanying cmv infection , whereas the second case was suspected as monomorphic ptld , and treated aggressively using a chemo - therapeutic regimen , but did not respond to treatment . because ptld treatments are most effective in the early stage , prior to the occurrence of progression of monomorphic or monoclonal proliferations , not only the early detection of ptld , but also the identification of the clonality of ptld , are of importance in planning the means of treatment .
the most likely source of ebv infection through solid organ transplantation is transmission through an organ from an ebv - positive to an ebv - seronegative recipient .
other possible contributing factors may be bronchus - associated lymphoid tissue ( balt ) and nodal tissue harboring ebv in the donor transplant .
