a 20-year - old refugee from liberia was referred to our hospital because of a loud murmur .
a , surgical correction of the pda was performed because of its large size and concomitant anomalous aortic anatomy .
the first case represents a more complex form of pda , associated with additional congenital cardiovascular anomalies and with left ventricular volume overload as one of its main characteristics . in the second patient ,
pda patients who are beyond surgical or percutaneous closure should be treated according to the guidelines for eisenmenger syndrome .
closure of a pda is only feasible when irreversible pulmonary hypertension has not yet developed . in adults ,
pulmonary hypertension was the sole reason for closure of the pda , and left ventricular dilation had not developed .
pda is usually diagnosed shortly after birth , and treated surgically or percutaneously to prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension and heart failure .
angiography of the aortic arch and the occluded pda with coil in situ can be seen in fig . 
he was referred for treatment of his pda on the assumption that it had contributed to the development of pulmonary hypertension .
however , a contribution of the pda to the development of pulmonary hypertension could not be excluded and the patient was therefore accepted for percutaneous closure of the pda .
