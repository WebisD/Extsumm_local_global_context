the additional value of eus - fna over eus alone for n and m staging of gc are emphasized in a study where distant ln and liver metastases were detected by eus - fna in 42% of the patients , and ct of the abdomen or thorax had previously failed to show any abnormality .
the accompanying vessels traverse through the ligaments surrounding stomach and the metastatic nodes commonly reside in ligaments rather than the retroperitoneum . soon after the first descriptions of the five - layer structure of the gastric wall , eus became a standard technique for the staging of gc . until a few years ago , the impact of eus in gc was limited by the lack of therapeutic options , surgery being the only recourse either with curative or with palliative intent .
eus guided fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology of ln stations defined by international association of study of lung cancer has made a significant impact in the management of lung cancer .
the use of eus in the preoperative determination of ln status in patients with gc can have a significant impact on patient management .
the nomenclature of nodal stations in abdomen is based primarily on the relationship of the lymphatic drainage ( lns ) that follows the accompanying vessel ( artery and vein ) or a direct relationship with the regional organ .
