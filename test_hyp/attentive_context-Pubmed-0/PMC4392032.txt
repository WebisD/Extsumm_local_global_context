hence , close observation is recommended in cases of tm combined with cryptorchidism and diffuse microlithiasis .
during the follow - up through puberty of the microlithiasis in the 23 boys in our present study , we observed no significant changes in the density of their microliths and no development of testicular cancer ; however , we found that diffuse tm and cryptorchidism tend to increase calcific density .
3 ) . to clarify the tendency of tm calcification toward increase vs. decrease we divided the subjects into three groups based on the calcific density change of tm ( increase : increased > 20% ; decrease : decreased > 20% ; no change : < 20% increase or decrease ) .
the mean age at presentation was 11.3 years and the mean follow - up period of approximately 5 years allowed follow - up of 23 patients over pubertal development . despite a follow - up interval that allowed potential pubertal changes to the testis , none of our patients developed testicular cancer or new abnormal symptoms . by contrast , there are some reported cases of patients with a known tm on us exam that eventually developed a primary testicular cancer .
