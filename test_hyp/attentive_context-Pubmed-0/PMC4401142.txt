we investigated the angiogenic response induced by gelatin sponges soaked with the cell suspensions and implantedonthecamsurfacefrom8today12ofincu - bation and we studied the effects of mmec and mgusec on the expression of endogenous levels in the cam of vegf , fgf-2 , angiopoietin-1(ang-1 ) , hypoxia - inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) and endostatin by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) .
the phenotypic switch to angiogenesis in tumour growth involves more than simple up - regulation of angiogenic activity and is thought to be the result of a net balance of positive and negative regulators , and our study suggests that angiogenic switch in mm , investigated by using an in vivo experimental model such as the chick cam , may involve loss of an endoge - nous angiogenesis inhibitor , namely endostatin .
our data are in accord with this statement , because the expression of endostatin mrna detected in both mgus and mm treated cam was significantly lower respect to control cam .
2 , treatment of cam with mmec and mgusec did not produce significant difference in the expression of pro - angiogenic factors mrna in comparison with control cam treated with medium alone .
