risk factors for mesh exposure in our analysis included operative duration and the concomitant procedures ( p = 0.043 , p = 0.001 ) .
a retrospective study of patients undergoing tvm surgery between january 2004 and december 2012 was conducted in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the first affiliated hospital of chinese pla general hospital .
clinical data were collected including age , menopause status , body mass index ( bmi ) , gravidity and parity , stage of the pop , tvm types , concomitant procedures , operation time , blood loss , postoperative morbidity , and postoperative mesh exposure . only patients with at least 3 months of follow - up time
we analyzed clinical data to identify possible risk factors for mesh exposure to reduce the tvm complication rate and to improve patients quality of life .
risk factors for mesh exposure in our analysis included operative duration and the concomitant procedures ( p = 0.043 , p = 0.001 ) .
access system should be implemented to select eligible surgeons , and a standardized management system should be established for pelvic surgery . in general , our results showed that tvm surgery is beneficial for patients with advanced pop . although exposure may occur after surgery , exposure rate was low and easy to manage .
