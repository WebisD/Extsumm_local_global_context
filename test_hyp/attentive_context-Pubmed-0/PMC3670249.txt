stat3 is a transcription factor that is activated by extracellular ligands , e.g. , the cytokines il-6 , il-10 , il-21 , il-27 , g - csf and leptin , but also by the growth factors egf and hgf , through specific binding to transmembrane receptors and the induction of receptor associated and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases .
the presence of an inappropriately strong stat3 signal is sufficient to trigger the clonal expansion of cd8 t cells , the emergence of large granular lymphocytic leukemia and the occurrence of autoimmune disorders .
the variants that have been detected in the stat3 gene in t - cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas gene have been designated as  constitutively active  and the ones found in the autosomal dominant hyper ige syndrome ( ad - hies ) as  dominant negative .
persisting and high levels of stat3 signaling seem to be associated with cellular proliferation and transformation . since the strength of stat3 signaling and the duration of its activation appear as central determinants of the phenotypic cellular functions of this transcription factor , these parameters are tightly controlled .
. how can a single transcription factor influence so many different functions ? the cellular contexts , defined by the activity of interacting signaling pathways and the epigenetic state most likely play determining roles , but the discrete levels and the duration of stat3 signaling also cooperate and contribute to the manifestation of distinct cellular outcomes . in skeletal muscle cells for example ,
