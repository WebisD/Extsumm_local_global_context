our study is the first retrospective report to describe the histopathology of the thyroid and parathyroid glands in hiv - infected aa patients in an inner city hospital in the united states .
human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) are associated with multiple endocrine abnormalities .
we conclude that thyroid and parathyroid abnormalities are uncommon findings in the hiv - infected african american population .
the most common characteristics of histopathology seen in the thyroid and parathyroid glands in these patients include interstitial fibrosis and parathyroid hyperplasia , respectively .
a retrospective review of histopathology findings of the thyroid and parathyroid glands at autopsy was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital during the year 1980 through 2007 .
there is however scant literature regarding histopathology of the thyroid and parathyroid glands in patients with hiv and aids , particularly in african americans ( aa ) . nevertheless , extensive literature is available on serum biochemical thyroid functions and calcium fluctuations in these patients .
euthyroid sick syndrome , hypothyroidism , hypocalcemia , impaired parathyroid hormone secretion , and vitamin d deficiency appear to be common among the adult hiv - infected patients   .
