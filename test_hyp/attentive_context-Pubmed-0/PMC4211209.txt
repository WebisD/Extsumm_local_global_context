further applicability of the method for the analysis of biological samples was demonstrated using cell lysates and tissue homogenates .
well characterized solutions of several purified proteins , protein mixtures , and examples of lipids and detergents were used to assess quantification limits , dynamic range , linearity , accuracy , precision , and robustness of the reported method .
the presented paper provides a detailed description of method development along with a comparison to other protein quantification techniques routinely used in biological laboratories , with respect to the required sample volume , time - consumption , labor - intensity , accuracy , and robustness .
the reported method is also compatible with organic solvents commonly used in peptide and lipid research . to achieve accurate quantitative results , strict adherence to a consistent loading volume between samples and controls
this technique was also successfully applied to complex sample analysis during a small - scale investigation of surgical breast tissue processing and fractionation .
however , from the narrow set of experimental results , such limits can exceed 100  mg / ml . although some buffer salts might not be compatible with the reported technique , in pbs , the method allows development of a general linear calibration between 0.25  mg / ml and 5  mg / ml . accuracy and precision of the reported method , within the linear range , are comparable with results obtained by amino acid analysis , providing researchers with a fast and cost - effective alternative to other protein quantitation tools available today . due
