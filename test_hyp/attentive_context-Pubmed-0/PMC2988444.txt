, he began working in gac 's laboratory studying the roles of non - coding rnas , including micrornas in the initiation and development of gastrointestinal cancers , as well as the identification of new non - coding rna biomarkers .
the focus of his scientific research is understanding the roles of non - coding rnas in gastrointestinal cancers . in march 2009
the authors   developed a modular device composed of a sensor ( an aptamer ) and a gene - regulatory component ( a hammerhead ribozyme ) and tested its ability to affect the expression of cytokines important for the function of t - lymphocytes in mouse and human systems .
a recent study by chen et al .   has produced a significant advance in solving such issues and therefore potentially bridging the gap between the bench and the bedside for synthetic rna - based regulatory systems .
more work remains to be done to elucidate the principles of biological design , and to overcome the scientific and technical challenges in designing and building more effective systems that are harmless to humans and therefore useful for clinical applications .
since july 2007 he has been an associate professor in experimental therapeutics at the md anderson cancer center and studies the roles of micrornas and other non - coding rnas in cancer initiation and progression , as well as the mechanisms of cancer predisposition , and explores new rna therapeutic options for cancer patients .
