one study evaluating the electrophysiological components of the h reflex and f wave 
 compared the pre- and post - tens h reflexes , and f wave latencies and amplitudes , and 
 reported the reduction in spasticity was associated with electrophysiologically proven 
 decreases in the h reflex amplitude , the f wave amplitude , and the h / m and f / m ratios23 . in another study , tens was applied 
 segmentally and heterosegmentally to the median nerve of the wrist , and to the common 
 peroneal nerve ( placebo ) .
measured the excitability of the motor neuron pool and compared the h / m ratios , the h 
 maximum amplitude , and the h slope / m slope ratio , in spastic and normal individuals , and 
 found there were marked differences between the two groups .
significant improvements in all parameters , 
 except pain , were evident in the tens group , and they were associated with decreases in the 
 h amplitude and h / m ratio , and the m response .
the results of this study suggest that tens is effective when used to manage 
 spasticity .
, significant 
 differences were found in the m response and h reflex amplitude between the healthy and 
 affected sides of spastic the hemiplegic stroke patients .
