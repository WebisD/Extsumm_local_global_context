this study involved exhaustive molecular typing of bse cases during a given test period and in a country in which bse testing has been mandatory for all adult slaughtered or fallen cattle .
however , the distribution of cattle affected by h- and l - type bse , by year of birth , differs strikingly from that of cattle affected by c - type bse and is consistent with the hypothesis that h - type and l - type bse might represent sporadic prion disorders . in comparison with another sporadic prion disease ,
we can not exclude possible differences in the pathogenesis of atypical bses that might result in underestimation of their frequency , e.g. , involvement of the brainstem at a later stage than with c - type bse .
the estimated frequency of h - type and l - type bse was 0.41 and 0.35 per million adult cattle tested , respectively ( 1.9 and 1.7 in cattle > 8 years of age ) . given the implementation dates of measures to control bse and the birth dates of these bse - infected cattle , foodborne exposure to an infectious agent can not be fully excluded for any of these cattle .
