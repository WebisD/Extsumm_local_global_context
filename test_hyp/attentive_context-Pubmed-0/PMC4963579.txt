facchinetti et al .   discovered that the physiological mi / dci ratio was 40  :  1 and , based on this finding , as well as on the specific behavior of both stereoisomers , we investigated the effects of a therapy that combines mi plus dci in the ratio of 40  :  1 , versus placebo , in order to improve some clinical outcomes in pcos young overweight women .
, we observed that , with respect to the baseline values , only the combined therapy of mi plus dci significantly rebalanced the endocrine and metabolic profiles of these patients , ameliorating their insulin resistance and the ovulatory function , as successfully recorded by ultrasound . as a matter of fact , lh and free testosterone levels decreased after the combined treatment , downregulating the hyperandrogenism , and even homa index and fasting insulin , markers of insulin resistance , resulted to be significantly reduced . on the other hand , e and shbg significantly increased , showing restoring in ovulation capability .
no relevant changes in these sex hormones were reported in group b , treated with placebo , and no significant modifications were observed after the treatment in both groups a and b for what concerns bmi , fsh , androstenedione , dheas , and fasting glucose .
