micronucleus assay was employed to determine the extent of baseline chromosome damage in bc patients and controls , and pcr - rflp was used for genotype analysis .
it is unknown whether the healthy controls and patients with bc had equal levels of dna damage before the appearance of clinical symptoms in the patients .
cyp1b1 v432l polymorphism had no association with bc occurrence in pre- and postmenopause women , however , in the premenopause women we observed increased risk to bc when the c allele of cyp1a1 gene ( t3205c polymorphism ) was present ( or 10.5 ; 95% ci 2.641.7 ) .
the hypothesis of the present study is that polymorphic variants of the estrogen metabolizing genes cyp17 , cyp1b1 , cyp1a1 , and comt may affect the spontaneous levels of chromosome damage in lymphocytes of bc patients and subsequently modulate bc risk . therefore , the objective of the present work was to correlate the genotypes of polymorphic variants of the above - mentioned genes with the basal levels of chromosome damage in lymphocytes of untreated bc patients and healthy individuals .
however , the followup of those controls who are carriers of met allele of cyp1b1 gene that exhibited higher frequencies of bnmn than wild - type counterparts could help to further answer this question .   in conclusion , according to the data presented here both the genetic background of genes involved estrogen metabolism and dna damage in healthy controls and patients can modulate bc risk reflected by higher chromosomal damage in lymphocytes .
