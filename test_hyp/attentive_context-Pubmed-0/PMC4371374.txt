the aims of this article are to provide a short overview of important mechanisms and genetic factors influencing nafld disease progression and to present strategies in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of nash .
non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) is the most common chronic liver disease in north america and has emerged as a serious public health burden .
although extensive research in understanding the disease pathogenesis and numerous clinical trials aimed at halting disease progression have been performed in the last two decades , optimal therapy is still lacking .
a better understanding of nash pathogenesis may help clarify the best approach in managing patients with nash .
the clinical - histological phenotype of nafld extends from non - alcoholic fatty liver ( nafl ) to nash .
whereas nafl can progress to cirrhosis in 2% to 3% , nash has an increased risk for the progression to cirrhosis at 15% to 20% and predisposes patients to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and increased mortality .
the multiplicity of pathways contributing to nash and fibrosis progression provides a rationale for individualized treatment strategies .
more studies are warranted in understanding the influence of genetics associated with disease progression and patient response to treatment .
