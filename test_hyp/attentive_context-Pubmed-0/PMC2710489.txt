the remnant liver regenerates up to approximately 80% of its initial total liver volume and over 83% of its original total liver function 3  months after major liver resection with or without prior pve .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative pve on postoperative liver volume and function 3  months after major liver resection .
liver scintigraphy showed a mean tc - mebrofenin uptake rate in the total liver of 7.90    1.5%/min / m in the control group and 7.11    1.6%/min / m in the pve group before any intervention ( p  =  0.24 ) .
liver function increased to 83% in the control group and to 88% in the pve group .
the remnant liver function reached 88.1% and 83,3% , respectively , of the original total liver function in both groups ( p  =  0.50 ) .
there was no correlation between volumetric and functional recovery , confirming the postulation that liver volume does not necessarily reflect liver function during liver regeneration.7 to our knowledge , there are no studies that compared postoperative liver volume increase and functional increase after partial liver resection in patients with and without prior pve .
only those patients in whom a complete set of ct scans was obtained were included in the study , i.e. , a four - phase ct scan prior to pve , 34  weeks after pve ( before liver resection ) , and 3  months after liver resection ( n  =  10 ) . in all the patients , hbs was performed before pve and in nine patients 3  months after liver resection .
