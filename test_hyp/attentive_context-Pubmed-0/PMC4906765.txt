as the transmission of b. bigemina is transovarian , the presence of rather few infected ticks on even a subclinically infected animal may acts as nidus of infection for the whole herd , posing severe economic losses and pathognomic effects on the animal as indicated by altered vital parameters contemplated though significant decrease in the level of rbc , hb , pcv , and mcv with significant increase in tbil , mch and mchc levels .
the present study was therefore undertaken to diagnose subclinical cases of babesiosis by pcr based molecular diagnosis in relation to the haemato - biochemical parameters to study the pathogenicity induced by latent infection of b. bigemina .
2 ) showed significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in the tec , hb , pcv and mcv , while significant increase ( p < 0.05 ) in mch and mchc in clinically and subclinically infected animals as compared to non - infected healthy control group ( fig .
the comparison of prevalence of bovine babesiosis by pcr and giemsa stained thin blood smear in dairy cattle of punjab , revealed highest prevalence in north - eastern region of punjab by both the techniques .
bars with different alphabets a , b and c differ significantly for the parameter a significant increase ( p < 0.05 ) was seen in alkp and ast of clinically infected group while the increase as non - significant in subclinically infected animals as compared to non - infected control group .
