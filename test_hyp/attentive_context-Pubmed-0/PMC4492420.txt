tc has demonstrated , in multiple studies , its usefulness on musculoskeletal system pathologies , due to its slow movements that involve the four limbs together with the regulation of breathing , postural control , and balance , and tc is now even recommended in some evidence - based clinical guidelines .
ht has been utilized with proven benefits derived from the mechanical properties of water that combine with the effects of the exercise , improving the muscle - skeletal conditions of the subjects . both treatment types involve the physical work of equilibrium , mobility , strength , coordination , and sensory input such as proprioception , with complementary advantages , which theoretically render them as possessing potential synergy in their benefits .
in addition to this relaxation and breathing can provide a complete exercise , with low joint impact and strength work at the same time .
combined tc and ht have been tested principally in older adults with risk of falls or fragility , and in some neurological or rheumatological pathologies .
it is important to know whether tc practiced in water is useful in other chronic pathologies that cause pain and alterations in walking , such as knee or hip oa . for this , it is necessary to develop good - quality rct in those included in conventional tc control groups , conventional ht groups , and in groups with both tc and ht combined , or conventional floor exercises ( stretching , strengthening , equilibrium ) , in order to acquire general evidence that establishes whether there is an advantage on combining both techniques .
