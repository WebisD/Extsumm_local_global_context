methylammonium 
 iodide ( ch3nh3i ) was prepared by dissolving 
 methylamine ( sigma - aldrich 534102 ) in absolute ethanol and reacting 
 with hydroiodic acid ( sigma - aldrich 210021 ) in an ice bath .
the spectral dependence of the absorptance ( a ) of the ch3nh3pbi3 films was determined 
 by making use of the formula a = 1  r  t. ple measurements were 
 performed in a commercial fluorometer ( fluorolog 3 from horiba ) .
total transmittance ( t ) and total reflectance ( r ) spectra of the ch3nh3pbi3 films were measured using an 
 integrating sphere attached to a uv  vis spectrophotometer ( shimadzu 
 uv-2101 pc ) .
ch3nh3i and pbcl2 ( sigma - aldrich 
 268690 ) were dissolved at a final concentration of 40 wt % in anhydrous n , n - dimethylformamide ( dmf ) ( the molar 
 ratio between ch3nh3i and pbcl2 was 
 3:1 ) .
after 6 s , while the spinning process 
 took place , 200 l of anhydrous chlorobenzene was dropped onto 
 the center of the substrate , as previously reported .
the resulting 
 films were then annealed at 100 c for 3 h , until a pure ch3nh3pbi3 layer was obtained . optical characterization .
