we , therefore , carried out this study to determine the total radiation exposure to icu resident doctors involved in the course of their duties .
we conducted a prospective , observational study in the icu and postanesthesia care unit ( pacu ) of a 500-bedded tertiary care cancer referral center in mumbai , india from september 2012 to february 2013 .
since this was recorded in a 3 month period , the projected reading for similar exposure throughout the year , even assuming a 24 h duty period , would be 0.4 msv , which is well below the safety limit of 20 msv / year .
the resident doctors provide 24 h cover , working in 12 h shifts , with four doctors in each shift . in each shift
however , we found that if standard safety precautions were followed , cumulative radiation exposure to icu resident doctor was well within permissible limits and was not the cause of concern and hence routine personal dosimetric monitoring is not needed for residents in icu .
the mean values in the first and last 3 months were 0.052 and 0.069 msv respectively , though the highest individual value approached 0.1 msv .
