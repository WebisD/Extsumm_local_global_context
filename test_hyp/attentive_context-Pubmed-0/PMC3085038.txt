these are the first pet / ct images of a g - csf - producing tumor in a urological disease .
in such cases , one needs to be careful to avoid a misdiagnosis of bone metastasis , but imaging may be useful for differential diagnosis of a g - csf - producing tumor in patients with abnormally high wbc counts in the absence of infection .
we performed f - fdg - pet with computed tomography ( pet / ct ) for imaging of the g - csf - producing tumor and found high f - fdg uptake by the tumor itself and diffuse uptake throughout the bone marrow .
carcinomas producing granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ) are extremely malignant and have a poor prognosis   .
the patient was a 63-year - old man with a history of hypertension and no specific family history .
this case is also the first report of pet / ct imaging of a g - csf - producing tumor in a urological disease .
thus , a liposarcoma producing g - csf is particularly rare and has only been described in a few case reports   . here ,
