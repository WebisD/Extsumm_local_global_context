we concluded that the optimum number of obtained prostate biopsies to reach acceptable diagnostic power with least infection rate is 12-core biopsy .
besides , there was a significant difference in detection of prostate cancer between 6-core biopsy and 18-core biopsy ( p = 0.001 ) , but there was no significant difference in the detection of prostate cancer between 12-core biopsy and 18-core biopsy ( p = 0.572 ) . in this study ,
pair wise comparison of infection rate between each two groups indicated no significant difference in infection rate between 6-core biopsy group and 12-core biopsy group ( p = 0.254 ) , but there was a significant difference in infection rate between 12-core biopsy group and 18-core biopsy group ( p = 0.028 ) as well as 6-core biopsy group and 18-core biopsy group ( p = 0.001 ) .
of 60 patients had positive biopsy results for prostate cancer ( p = 0.003 ) ( figure 1 ) .
binary comparison of prostate biopsy results between each two groups indicated a significant difference in the detection of prostate cancer between 6-core biopsy and 12-core biopsy ( p = 0.006 ) .
our study results showed that increasing the number of obtained biopsies from 6 to 12 is logical and increased the detection rate of prostate cancer significantly , but further increase in the number of biopsy specimens from 12 to 18 only increased post biopsy infectious complications without significant increase in cancer detection rate .
