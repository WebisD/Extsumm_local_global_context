in addition , we characterized the phenotypes of sea lion - derived coccidian protozoa in both a mouse model of pathogenesis and in mammalian cell culture .
evidence to date suggests that california sea lions act as both definitive and intermediate hosts of novel protozoa in the absence of clinical signs or pathologic evidence of disseminated infection . yet , the identification of severe protozoal hepatitis , myocarditis and encephalitis in a neonatal harbor seal infected with coccidia c is of particular concern because it indicates that sea lions may be capable of shedding coccidian protozoa that are pathogenic to harbor seals and perhaps other aquatic wildlife ( colegrove et  al . , 2011 ) . a better understanding of the biology , epidemiology , and pathogenesis of tissue - encysting coccidian organisms that parasitize marine mammals is needed to properly assess the risks and burden of protozoal disease in aquatic ecosystems such as the pacific coast of north america . as part of ongoing health surveillance in aquatic species of the pacific ocean , and accompanying studies of pathogen pollution in near - coastal california waters
the investigation of infectious diseases in coastal aquatic wildlife allows us to probe the relationships between terrestrial - origin pathogen distribution , patterns of overland water runoff , and the risk of pathogen pollution in the coastal and ocean environment .
