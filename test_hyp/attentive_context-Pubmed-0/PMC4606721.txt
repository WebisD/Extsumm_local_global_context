in order to obtain esthetic papillary height and tissue integrity around implants proper and meticulous implant positioning is needed .
being a long term follow - up report this technique can be considered as a simple , minimal invasive procedure , which can be followed during 2 stage surgery .
15 bard parker blade [ figure 1 ] 
  a vertical releasing incision placed mesially and distally to the crestal incision without disturbing the adjacent teeth papilla and extending about 3 mm labially [ figure 2 ] 
  soft tissue reflected to expose the cover screw [ figure 3 ] 
  palatal extension of the incision followed closer to the adjacent teeth on both sides , and a release incision made around the palatal portion of the exposed cover screw [ figure 4 ] 
  then healing abutment is placed after thoroughly cleaning the soft tissue around internal hex of the implant [ figure 5 ] 
  soft tissue approximated with 40 suture material ( vicryl ) sutures removal has to be done after 10 days after 2 weeks , second stage prosthetic procedure should be carried out . incision and flap outlined ( after reflection )
