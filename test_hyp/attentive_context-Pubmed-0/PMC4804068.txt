the most prevalent protozoan parasites were cryptosporidium ( 10% ) , giardia , and isospora showing the same prevalence ( 5.3% ) .
the present study therefore aimed to identify the actual gastrointestinal fauna in these free - ranging sea lions within their natural habitat in the river of the city of valdivia , chile , and to gain some insights in their potential zoonotic impact on public health issues .
balantidium infections were detected at lower prevalence ( 2.5% , table 1 ) . within the metazoan endoparasites ,
the nematodes were the most rich in species ( two species ) followed by cestodes and trematodes with one species each . referring to parasite genus level
in particular , regular monitoring programs should be established by local authorities for public health issues and for sea lion populations living in close proximity to human beings .
parasitological analyses of faecal samples of south american sea lions revealed 8 different protozoan ( 4 ) and metazoan ( 4 ) taxa .
an essential component of the control of these diseases , from a public health perspective , is a better understanding of the sources and routes of transmission in different geographical regions .
