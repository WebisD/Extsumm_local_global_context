we discuss the possible adaptive significance of deviations from the typical nest exit that have been documented in several paper wasp species , including p. emaciata .
we hypothesize that the unusual defensive response of p. emaciata is a behavioral adaptation to its use of mud in nest construction , which may make the nest more resistant than paper to entry by vertebrate predators .
we suggest that this represents a special type of architectural defense ( hermann and blum , 1981 ) , where the defensive behavior of a species has been modified to exploit the properties of its nest material
box plots showing the range of probabilities of response to nest disturbance with attack within 30 sec by polybia emaciata and p. occidentalis colonies .
photograph of a mud nest of polybia emaciata collected july 1998 in gamboa , panama .
residents of costa rica from several rural communities reported collecting and moving active p. emaciata colonies without being stung , by placing a finger over the nest entrance and plucking the nest from its attachment point .
chadab ( 1979 ) noted that one colony of p. emaciata in ecuador had  durable  nest paper and exhibited defensive retreat responses like those that we recorded ; two other p. emaciata colonies had  fragile  nests and performed exit - nest and attack behavior when jarred .
