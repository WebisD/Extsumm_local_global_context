this report concerns a simple , easy and feasible laboratory test using a routine automated hematological analyzer that detects leukocyte abnormalities in patients with myopathy or cardiomyovasculopathy and possibly leads to a diagnosis of homozygous atgl deficiency .
a notification system using an automated hematology analyzer may prompt the earlier and easier diagnosis of homozygous atgl deficiency .
the diagnosis of atgl deficiency was based on gene analyses together with clinical manifestations of myopathy , including easy fatigability , reduced exercise capability and limb weakness , and cardiomyopathy .
we , therefore , anticipate that detection of the leucocyte abnormality in a routine automated hematological analysis may be a first step toward the diagnosis of homozygous atgl deficiency .
the baso - wx and baso - wy values obtained from automated hematology analyzer xe-5000 could help to detect jordans ' anomaly .
the diagnosis of atgl deficiency was based on gene analyses together with clinical manifestations of myopathy , including easy fatigability , reduced exercise capability and limb weakness , and cardiomyopathy .
affected patients with atgl deficiency exclusively exhibit persistent lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of circulatory neutrophils known as jordans ' anomaly ( fig . 
four homozygous atgl - deficient patients ( 3 males and 1 female , 4560  years of age ) ( table  1 ) and nine heterozygous family members ( 4 males and 5 females , 1783  years ) , lacking atgl deficiency - associated symptoms , were enrolled .
