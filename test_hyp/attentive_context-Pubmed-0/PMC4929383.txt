we present a case where a diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischaemia was delayed due to atypical symptomatology , leading to consecutive cognitive errors by the treating clinicians .
awareness of the possibility of such errors allows clinicians to reflect critically on their diagnostic reasoning in difficult cases and reduce diagnostic delay .
this case highlights the importance of recognising atypical presentations of gastrointestinal conditions as well as considering causes for diarrhoea outside the gut lumen .
this is unusual : in one retrospective review of 54 cases of mesenteric ischaemia , pain was present in 98% of patients , with diarrhoea only in 24.5% and nausea in 2% .
importantly , it serves as an illustration of multiple cognitive errors to which clinicians may be susceptible in practice .
firstly , his symptoms consisted primarily of diarrhoea and nausea for the majority of his illness , with pain being a very late feature .
atherosclerotic stenoses of the coeliac , superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries are common . in a retrospective review of 980 angiographic studies by thomas et al .
a 67-year - old man presented to clinic with 4 months of increasing diarrhoea and weight loss from 74 to 60 kg .
