the aim of this study was to evaluate , using a conventional pcr assay , the prevalence of mhf and cmhm infections in stray cats from colonies in milan and to identify possible risk factors for these infections .
none of the risk factors were associated with the pcr results for haemoplasmas ( tables 1 and 2 ) , with the exception of negative associations at univariate and multivariate analysis between winter season of sampling and haemoplasma positive status ( p = 0.01 , or = 0.29 , 95% ci = 0.140.61 , p = 0.001 ) and cmhm positive status ( p = 0.01 , or = 0.29 , 95% ci = 0.120.70 , p = 0.01 ) .
haemoplasmic dna was detected in 33.1% ( 86/260 , 95% ci 26.540.9% ) of blood samples . of the positive samples , 28 cats ( 10.8% , 95% ci 7.215.6% )
from this study it can be concluded that feline haemotropic mycoplasma mhf and cmhm are common in the stray cat population of milan .
were infected with mhf and 58 cats ( 22.3% , 95% ci 16.928.8% ) were infected with cmhm .
no significant associations were found with cbc abnormalities and haemoplasma pcr - positive results ( figure 1 ) or in the number of anaemic and nonanaemic cats using a t - test .
