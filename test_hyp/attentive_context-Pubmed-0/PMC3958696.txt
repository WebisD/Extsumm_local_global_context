further understanding of the interaction between cmv and hiv-1 may establish methods to reduce the morbidity and growth impairment of hiv - exposed infants and maximize the benefits of breastfeeding in low - resource countries .
further , we evaluated the impact of milk cmv load on the growth of breastfed , hiv - exposed infants .
however , this study was initiated prior to establishment of the impact of maternal haart on postnatal hiv-1 transmission , allowing us to compare breast milk cmv shedding and cmv transmission in haart - treated and untreated mothers . in our cohort ,
moreover , the negative association between milk cmv load and postnatal growth in hiv - exposed infants in this small study is intriguing and should be further assessed in larger clinical studies , determining whether reduction of postnatal cmv exposure is important to improving the developmental outcome of hiv - exposed infants . additional larger studies of the kinetics of maternal cmv shedding , postnatal transmission , and infant growth in the setting of maternal haart would now be important given the current standard of care .
the limitations of this hypothesis - generating pilot study include a relatively small maternal sample size and lack of infant urine or saliva for confirmatory diagnosis of cmv congenital and postnatal cmv acquisition . despite its small sample size , this study is unique in its enrollment of both haart - treated and untreated mothers , as it enrolled prior to the establishment of maternal arv treatment during breastfeeding as highly preventative against postnatal hiv transmission , elevating the importance of our analysis of cmv and hiv-1 load in milk and infant growth in this cohort . with these limitations in mind , we have demonstrated that maternal haart does not have a large impact on breast milk cmv shedding , indicating that postnatal cmv exposure for hiv - exposed infants will continue at a similar level despite increasing maternal hiv-1 therapy / prophylaxis during breastfeeding .
