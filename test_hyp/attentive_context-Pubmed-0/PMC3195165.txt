incidence of pica has also been linked to iron and zinc deficiency . whether the pica is an eating disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder is still controversial .
the present case presented a unique conglomeration of cultural , psychodynamic , and physiological determinants which together contributed to the expression of pica in comparison with previous reports and reviews . however , an interesting fact in this case is the age of the patient which is quite unusual for pica to occur .
this perhaps necessitates further research in dealing with the epidemiology and other aspects of this quite rare but interesting disease entity .

the patient was a 27 year old young indian lady living in the baruipur with no previous psychiatric or medical history .
patient complained of an unusual sensation in her abdomen for the last 3 months while her parents gave a history of habitual consumption of nails for the same duration .
