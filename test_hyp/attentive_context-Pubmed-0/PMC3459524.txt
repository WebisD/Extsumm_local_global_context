, we aimed to compare the plasma creatinine levels with spot urine il-18 levels following radiocontrast administration .
another limitation is that urine il-18 measurement was indexed to serum creatinine instead of urine creatinine since serum creatinine is considered to be a better and commonly used marker in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury . in conclusion ,
plasma creatinine levels in patients before and after radiocontrast agent administration compared with precontrast urine spot il-18 levels , postcontrast 6 and 24 h urinary levels of il-18 increased significantly ( p=0.048 and p=0.028 , respectively ; table 3 ) . a tendency for postcontrast 24-h urinary il-18 levels to increase
some reports have shown that il-18 levels start to increase within 46 h and peak at 12 h in patients with acute renal injury . in this study
twenty patients ( 11 males and 9 females ) underwent diagnostic and therapeutic contrast - enhanced examinations at the department of internal medicine from january 2009 to march 2009 .
spot urine il-18 levels at sixth hour following radiocontrast administration suggesting that it may be an earlier parameter for identifying kidney injury .
a slight increase in creatinine levels occurred at 48 h after radiocontrast administration but they fell to precontrast values at 72 h. a slight increase in plasma creatinine levels at 24 and 48 h following radiocontrast administration was observed compared with precontrast values , but it was not statistically significant ( p=0.052 and p=0.285 , respectively ) [ table 2 ] .
