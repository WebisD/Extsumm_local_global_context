combined use of ncha bone graft with collagen membrane resulted in clinically and statistically significant ppd reduction , cal gain and bone fill percentage , compared to ofd alone , in periodontal intrabony defects .
this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of ncha bone replacement graft ( sybograf ) in combination with bioresororbable collagen membrane ( periocol ) compared with open flap debridement alone .
comparison of change in clinical and radiographic parameter between test and control group at 6 months statistically significant mean cal gains of 3.780.66 mm and 2.781.09 mm were observed in the test and control groups , respectively , from baseline to 6 month [ tables 2 and 3 ] .
test and control group at baseline and 6 months at six months , the mean ppd reduction was 4.330.50 mm for the test and 3.221.09 mm for the control group [ tables 2 and 3 ] .
analysis by mann whitney u test demonstrated a statistically significantly ( p=0.01 ) greater reduction in mean ppd favoring the test group , and an additional 1.11 mm ppd reduction was observed in test group [ table 3 ] .
the present study was designed to compare the combined effect of bg+gtr ( test group ) with ofd ( control group ) in the treatment of intrabony periodontal defects .
