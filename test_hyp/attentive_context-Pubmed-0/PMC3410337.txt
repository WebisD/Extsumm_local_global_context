hence , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of three most commonly used methods of sealer placement on the sealing ability of the sealer .
the icc was 0.99 ( 95% ci : 0.991.00 ) suggestive of a high examiner reliability . due to technical problems during the experiment , one specimen was lost in group g1 , resulting in 32 samples for this group .
however , the master gutta - percha coating technique could be preferable as it produced the least leakage value , and no extra instrumentation and procedures are needed in its application .
within its limitations , this study showed that the three tested techniques of sealer placement provided a comparable seal .
there was no significant difference ( p = 0.305 ) of dye penetration among all groups .
the instrumented teeth were divided randomly into 3 experimental groups of 33 teeth each in addition to 2 groups which served as positive and negative control groups of 10 teeth each [ table 1 ] .
in contrast , the negative controls showed no evidence of leakage in any of the samples .
the positive controls demonstrated complete dye penetration throughout the length of the canal in all teeth .
