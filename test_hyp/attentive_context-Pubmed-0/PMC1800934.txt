the paper unfolds as follows : first , we show how health and social care evolved through time , from an integrated approach to separated systems , describing the historical development of the portuguese health care system and its financing and discussing the offering of social care in portugal , namely sad .
socio - demographic trends demand new approaches in the provision of care such as the integrated care concept to promote the continuity of care and the reduction of inefficiencies and redundancies , which implies a change in the professionals ' culture and a redesign of the care system itself .
the specific objectives of sad include : satisfying patients basic needs , providing physical and social support to the individuals and their families , and collaborating in health care provision .
the integrated care concept requires major efforts concerning communication between parties and the building of a shared vision between scientists , politicians and practitioners .
the health and social care sectors in portugal need a major reorganization effort and the concept of integrated care   emerges as a response to these challenges based on a coordinated work between independent institutions and professionals as a way to guarantee the continuity of care , improving health , quality of care and patient satisfaction , raising the efficiency and the effectiveness of social and health systems , and fostering patient 's empowerment .
