we examine how elevated weight and obesity ( using an indicator that considers both bmi and waist circumference ) relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovascular , metabolic , and inflammatory markers in three aging societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and obesity epidemic , history of economic development , socioeconomic levels , general lifestyle habits , health behaviors , and health care systems : the us , england , and taiwan .
first , obesity is associated with physiological dysregulation in all countries with differences in the links between specific indicators of biological risk and obesity .
the country differences in the links between obesity and physiological dysregulation are particularly marked when comparing obesity among taiwanese older adults relative to westernized populations , such as the us and england .
finding differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally problematic across all countries .
yields different relationships between weight and physiological dysregulation in the us and taiwan . in the us ,
the availability of biomarker data from taiwan  a middle - income country undergoing rapid economic growth , increasing obesity , and with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to that of the us and england  allows for investigation of the biological risk associated with obesity in a population characterized by very different cultural , behavioral , socioeconomic , and dietary parameters .
