accordingly , we introduce the term  hgt turbulence  as a general moniker for this category of phylogenetic artifacts . mutually reinforcing evidence for these types of hgt turbulence was apparent in the phylogenetic analyses of both simulated sequences and a naturally occurring set of native and chimeric mitochondrial sequences , with the simulations providing greater
, we explore the effects of chimeric sequences on phylogeny reconstruction by conducting phylogenetic analyses on simulated sequences and on an augmented set of the atp1 sequences analyzed in reference 12 .
the analyses reported in this study show that the inclusion in phylogenetic analyses of chimeric sequences arising from hgt and gene conversion can produce a variety of spurious phylogenetic results . these include the misplacement of both chimeric and native sequences , as well as branch length distortions .
it is also important to realize that while these simulations were framed and presented in the context of hgt , their results apply equally well to conversion between paralogs arising from internal gene duplication as to xenologs arising from hgt .
we recently reported such mosaicism in mitochondrial atp1 and matr genes belonging to different groups of flowering plants ( angiosperms ) .
we show that these mosaic genes largely escaped detection by recombination - detection programs and were recognizable only by direct visual inspection of dna sequence alignments . in this report
