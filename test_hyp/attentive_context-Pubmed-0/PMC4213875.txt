thorough knowledge of the root canal anatomy is an essential pre - requisite for endodontic success .
incidence of multiple canals in maxillary first molars this case report discusses the endodontic management of an unusual root canal configuration in a maxillary first molar showing three roots and seven canals .
this unusual morphology was confirmed with the help of cone beam computerized tomography ( cbct ) scans .
the clinician should use increased magnification and advanced diagnostic aids similar to cbct , to ensure identification and location of additional canals .
the knowledge that aberrant canals are more common than earlier assumed is increasingly being proven .
the tooth clearing methods have generally been considered the gold standard for analyzing the root canal anatomy , which involves making the tooth transparent and staining the canals for study , but these ex - vivo methods require the extraction of a tooth .
this is because , with cbct scanning , the raw data are acquired in the course of a single sweep of a cone - shaped x - ray source and reciprocal detector around the patient 's head . of the various comprehensive maxillary first molar ex - vivo studies in dental literature ,
