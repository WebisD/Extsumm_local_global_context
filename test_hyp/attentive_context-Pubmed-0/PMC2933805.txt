current developments in the world of nanotechnology demonstrate the role of position and context and strategic games in promising technology .
dupont and environmental defense ( who could be viewed as adversarial stakeholders ) formed a partnership to work together to produce a nano risk framework,7 aimed at evaluating and addressing potential environmental , health and safety risks of nanomaterials across the entire life cycle of the materials .
the corporate partnership between dupont and environmental defense may set a precedent for a new kind of interaction between industry and ngos .
the ambivalences of nanotechnology , and of promising technologies more generally , are not just an intellectual challenge ; the evolving strategic games that are played are for real , even if the discourse of responsible development may start as a new  language game.
there is a back - and - forth pattern of ethical argumentation between proponents and opponents of the technology .
both organisations have issued a call for feedback on the framework and have encouraged companies to adopt the framework .
this division of labour , new configurations in the world of nanotechnology , such as the collaboration between the chemical manufacturing company dupont and the non - profit group environmental defense , suggest that there is already a move towards redefining responsibilities in the world of nanotechnology . in 2005 ,
