this work demonstrates for the first time that high glucose concentration can induce oxidative stress and axonal degeneration in adult sensory neurons , but only if these neurons exhibit an stz - induced diabetic phenotype .
mmol / l and higher and showed , using an array of markers of oxidative stress and apoptosis , that these indexes were enhanced in cultured embryonic neurons .
also , ros scavenging systems , primarily mnsod , may not be as efficient in the axon because of reduced expression.figure 9 shows that sensory neurons with a stz - diabetic phenotype can mount an mnsod - based antioxidant defense in axons in response to high glucose ; however , by 3 days in vitro , the upregulation of mnsod expression shows signs of failing and may contribute to enhanced oxidative stress and associated aberrant axon structure ( fig .
initial experiments were designed to test the influence of high concentrations of glucose ( 50 mmol / l ) on survival of sensory neurons in culture , the induction of apoptosis , and markers of oxidative stress .
9h ) . these events may combine to place an additional load on mitochondrial bioenergetics not seen in the perikarya and sensitize the physiology of the organelle to elevations in ca and high glucose concentration .
