healthy cartilage metabolism was assessed by studying changes in gag , collagen , and dna content over 17 days of culture . in general ,
previous research has shed some light on the dynamics of cartilage explant culture ; however , our understanding of culture dynamics is incomplete and has been obstructed by differences in the anatomical location of the tissue harvests , the extraction method , the culture conditions , and the age of the tissue used in various studies.15 the aim of this study was to investigate the response of cartilage to the trauma sustained during explant extraction by observing biochemical changes ( i.e. , cell number , proteoglycan content , and collagen content following excision and culture of full - thickness explants with an intact subchondral bone layer ) .
, we sought to report the dynamics of cartilage metabolism in the context of a generalized culture process ; future studies should aim to elucidate the factors that affect the long - term culture characteristics of bovine articular cartilage .
cartilage metabolism was found to be relatively stable for a culture period of up to 10 days if the explant was given two days to equilibrate .
