our previous dynamic analyses of the fertilization process in human oocytes and of human embryonic development using the in vitro tlc system   confirmed for the first time the detailed time course of sequential events during embryonic development and revealed novel phenomena [ fertilization cone , cytoplasmic strand , and splitting of the inner cell mass ( icm ) ] under culture conditions in vitro [ supplementary movie 1 ( online resource 1 ) ] .
we therefore consider that the phenomenon described herein differs from previously proposed mechanisms for polyspermy block , prompting us to re - analyze all of our tlc data covering the fertilization process .
herein , we provide the results of this second detailed tlc analysis , which we believe confirms the existence of a novel mechanism for the prevention of polyspermy .
this system enables non - invasive and continuous imaging of human oocyte fertilization and embryonic development .
our further observation of the movie revealed another novel phenomenon that is likely to be involved in the mechanism of polyspermy block , wherein once the leading sperm has penetrated the zona pellucida ( zp ) and attached to the oocyte membrane , any following sperm within the zp stop penetrating immediately . to date , two types of polyspermy block were thought to exist in marine animals and mammals , including human (  oocyte membrane block  and  zona reaction  ) .
