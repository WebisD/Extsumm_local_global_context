 sacubitril / valsartan is a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin ii receptor blocker , indicated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure.a patient previously stable on atorvastatin developed severe rhabdomyolysis and an elevation of transaminases within 26  days of initiation of sacubitril / valsartan . 

this case of severe rhabdomyolysis should stimulate further investigation of the potential negative effects of the initiation of sacubitril / valsartan in patients receiving statin therapy .
this patient had been on a variety of statins for more than 7  years , including atorvastatin , simvastatin , and rosuvastatin .
future reports of this reaction may help to define high - risk patients , but it should be noted that our patient had no known high - risk characteristics for the development of rhabdomyolysis , except for prior mild elevations of ck during hospitalizations for chf exacerbations .
, rhabdomyolysis developed within 3  weeks of initiation of sacubitril / valsartan and evaluation within a shorter time frame may be appropriate .
we recommend consideration of obtaining baseline ck levels and lfts and close observation of patients . in this case
the drug interaction probability scale score was 3 , consistent with a possible interaction as a cause for the reaction , with sacubitril / valsartan as the precipitant drug and atorvastatin as the object drug .
