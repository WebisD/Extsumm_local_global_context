the direct removal of glucose by dapagliflozin complements the insulin - sensitizing action of pioglitazone , providing a potential combination that balances well the benefits and risks of therapy for some patients with type 2 diabetes .
in this study , the addition of dapagliflozin to pioglitazone lowered hba1c levels and attenuated the pioglitazone - related weight gain in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on pioglitazone alone .
as a possible mild diuretic and consistent glucouretic , dapagliflozin mitigated the weight gain and fluid retention due to pioglitazone . even though more genital infections occurred with dapagliflozin than placebo , dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone was effective and well - tolerated .
the proportion of patients with an event suggestive of uti was 7.9 , 8.5 , and 5.0% with placebo , dapagliflozin 5 mg , and 10 mg , respectively , through week 48 .
this randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group , 24-week study with a subsequent 24-week extension enrolled male and female patients with type 2 diabetes between 29 july 2008 and 4 july 2009 .
they included serum creatinine increase ( four events ) , creatinine renal clearance decrease ( one event ) , glomerular filtration rate decrease ( one event ) , and abnormal renal function test ( one event ) .
