pleural tb usually presents with symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain , cough , and fever and it is recommended that when pleural tb is suspected , patients should undergo thoracocentesis and a blind closed pleural biopsy ( bcpb ) . in our institution , bcpb is not performed , which posed a dilemma since the patient was deemed too unwell for a thoracoscopy .
our case highlights the potential for serious harm when pleural procedures are performed without bedside pleural ultrasound . pulmonary tuberculosis ( tb ) is a leading cause of death worldwide , especially in developing countries .
the british thoracic society have provided guidelines that detail a systematic approach to the investigation of unilateral pleural effusion .
we believe that this case report has highlighted three pertinent issues in the management of patients ' with pleural effusion : wrong side thoracocentesis , lack of equipment to perform bcpb and induced sputum .
diagnosis can be made from sputum for microscopy for acid - fast bacilli ( afb ) and tb culture .
this case highlights certain health care system deficiencies that resulted in delays and potential harm to our patient with pleural tb .
our patient was an 86-year - old man , never smoker , who presented to a regional hospital with a 4 weeks history of nonproductive cough , dyspnea , and left pleuritic chest pain .
