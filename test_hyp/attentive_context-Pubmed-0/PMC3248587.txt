we report this case , along with our review of the literature , to emphasize the importance of performing a more thorough and accurate diagnosis when treating ppp .
our patient experienced what was considered a persistent neuropathic pain after undergoing an excision of a benign tumor in her thigh .
isolated femoral neuropathy is rarely reported as the cause of ppp . in most cases ,
however , an imaging test revealed a metastatic tumor in her iliopsoas muscle , and our diagnosis eventually changed to tumor induced lumbar plexopathy .
a 30-years old woman visited at our hospital , complaining of pain in her lower back , left inguinal area , and left leg .
the recent surge in interest in ppp in the medical community may play a part in clinicians delivering a misdiagnosis due to the lack of a thorough evaluation of the patient 's symptoms , while there can be many causes of the pain after the surgery .
using a minimally invasive surgical approach is important in the prevention of ppp . anatomically speaking ,
in fact , postoperative femoral neuropathy has been reported in a number of cases in gynecology , in vascular surgery , and in renal transplantation [ 3 - 5 ] . since the first study in chronic post - surgical pain was published by crombie et al .   in 1998 , a growing interest in ppp has developed among clinicians .
