pretreatment with epo and application of ipc significantly ameliorated the renal injury induced by bilateral renal ir .
the aim of this study was to compare the effects of recombinant human epo and ipc on renal ischemia / reperfusion injury and their effects on the production of ros .
the present study demonstrated that 50 minutes bilateral renal ir injury caused significant increases in plasma levels of bun and creatinine .
our results showed that application of ipc caused a significant reduction in mda production , indicating a reduction in lipid peroxidation and cellular damage .
previous studies have demonstrated that , mda tissue content is also commonly used as a marker of oxidative stress in renal ir injury ( 21 ) . in the present study , we demonstrated that ir resulted in increased mda content in renal tissues and was associated with impaired kidney function .
rats were allocated randomly into four experimental groups ( n = 6 ) : sham group , after laparotomy , rats were subjected to surgical manipulation without intervention ; ir group , rats were subjected to bilaterally renal ischemia for 50 minutes followed by 24 hours reperfusion ; ir + epo , rats were subjected to ir ( as in ir group ) , a single dose of epo ( 5000 u / kg ) was injected intraperitoneally thirty minutes before the onset of ischemia ; ir + ipc , rats were subjected to ischemic preconditioning ( ipc ) regimen before the onset of ischemia ( figure 1 ) . at the end of the surgery ,
