in an attempt to address some of the problems associated with the lack of tumor selectivity and stability of conventional cytostatic drugs , a variety of novel drug delivery systems has been developed . of these , liposomal drug carrier systems represent a mature and versatile technology , and several liposomal formulations of anti - cancer drugs have been approved for cancer chemotherapy or are in advanced stages of clinical development .
theoretically , these goals may be reached in two ways : ( i ) the encapsulated drug is prevented from reaching healthy tissue (  site avoidance  ) and/or ( ii ) drug concentrations are delivered mainly to neoplastic tissue (  drug targeting  ) . meanwhile , several liposomal formulations have been approved for the treatment of different tumors and have become an established addition to the anti - cancer drug armamentarium ( hofheinz et al 2005 ) . in this review
finally , the potential benefit of depocyte treatment in malignant meningitis of solid tumors remains a challenge to be explored in further clinical trials .
we briefly summarize the results of liposomal encapsulated cytarabine for the treatment of lymphomatous and leukemic meningitis .
they were first described by bangham et al ( 1965 ) in the mid 1960s and were initially used as a model system to study biological membranes . the term
