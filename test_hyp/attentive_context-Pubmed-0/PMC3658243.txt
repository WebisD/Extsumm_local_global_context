our patient is considered to have a distinct subtype of he s in which we documented ( a ) the pattern of seasonal oscillation of eosinophilia over 6 years and ( b ) effective control of eosinophilia with a combination of cyclosporin a , suplatast tosilate , and a small dose of prednisolone .
idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome ( he s ) is characterized by persistent or recurrent hypereosinophilia of unknown origin .
the patient reported here has shown significant periodic oscillating hypereosinophilia , which was shown to be fip1l1-pdgfra fusion gene - negative , and was suspected to have gleich syndrome , but not a version compatible with cases previously described .
currently , we recognize that he s consists of the myeloproliferative form and the lymphocytic form ( t - cell - mediated disorders).1 recent identification of fip1l1-pdgfra fusion gene - positive he s , as a subgroup , has opened a door to innovative treatment using imatinib mesylate in patients with a subset of hes.2,3 however , treatment of other patients with a heterogeneous subgroup of gleich syndrome ( periodic angioedema and eosinophilia ) and other types of he s without known pathogenesis remains to be explored in future .
