we recently showed that the effect on outcome of several prognostic factors was strongly influenced by age and was more pronounced in ahf patients younger than 75  years , compared with the older ones.6 the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of precipitating factors of ahf on readmission and longterm mortality in the overall population of patients admitted for ahf and in the subgroup of patients aged 75  years or younger .
in particular , patients with ahf precipitated by acute pulmonary disease showed fewer readmissions and higher 1  year mortality , especially in patients aged 75  years or younger .
after adjustment for potential confounding factors , acute pulmonary disease showed only a nonsignificant trend towards higher risk of death in the overall population ( hr 1.46 , 95% ci 0.942.25 , p  =  0.09 ) .
in the overall population , acute pulmonary disease was associated with lower readmission rates ( hazard ratio ( hr ) 0.61 , 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 0.370.99 , p  =  0.049 ) , whereas atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , acute coronary syndrome and other precipitating factors showed a nonsignificant trend towards higher readmission rates .
