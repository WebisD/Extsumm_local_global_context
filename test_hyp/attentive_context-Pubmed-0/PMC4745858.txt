we conducted a 1-year prospective observational trial in a daily - life setting involving 90 japanese patients with copd to investigate whether previous moderate - to - severe exacerbations are associated with future exacerbations in this patient population .
exacerbation is an important life - threatening event for patients with copd , and can lead to hospitalization and death.14 patients who suffer frequent and repeated exacerbations within 1 year have a poor prognosis,5 characterized by worsening of health - related quality of life ( hrqol),6,7 a rapid decline in lung function,810 and high mortality.11 frequent exacerbators also carry a high risk of further exacerbation and hospitalization.11,12 however , it has been suggested that japanese patients with copd may have fewer exacerbations , and they also may have a higher proportion of elderly patients , those with emphysema , and those with a lower body mass index in comparison to westerners.1215 the prognosis of japanese patients with copd who suffer frequent and repeated exacerbations is unclear .
the presence of gerd , regular use of ics , and low fev1 may be associated with frequent exacerbations .
the numbers of patients with non- , infrequent , and frequent exacerbations were 58 ( 64.4% ) , 12 ( 13.3% ) , and 20 ( 22.2% ) , respectively ( figure 1 ) . at baseline , frequent exacerbators had a significantly lower body mass index , were less likely to be male or current smokers , had higher mmrc - scale grades and higher total cat score , had a higher proportion of spirometric stages iii and iv , gerd , and use of inhaled corticosteroid ( ics)/long - acting muscarinic antagonist or ics / long - acting 2-agonist combination therapy , and lower lung - function parameters , including fev1 , fvc , and fev1/fvc ratio before and after bronchodilator use compared with nonexacerbators , but not in comparison with infrequent exacerbators ( table 1 ) .
