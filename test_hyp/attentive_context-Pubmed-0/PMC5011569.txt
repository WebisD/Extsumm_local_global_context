measuring the strength of peak first tfm , 
 ankle plantar flexors , knee extensors , and hip extensors in the lower limb and df rom may be 
 useful in clinical practice for improving jump performance in athletes such as volleyball 
 and basketball players .
cmj : countermovement jump , df rom : ankle dorsiflexion range of motion , tfm : toe 
 flexor muscle shows the pearson s correlation coefficients between peak tfm strength , df 
 rom , and cmj height in the participants . cmj height showed a moderate correlation with df 
 rom ( r=0.642 , r=41.3% , p<0.001 ) and a high correlation with peak first tfm 
 strength ( r=0.765 , r=58.5% , p<0.001 ) .
the relationships between cmj height 
 and peak tfm strength of the other toes were negligible ( r=0.021 to 0.233 , p>0.05 ) . * p<0.05 ; * * p<0.001 .
