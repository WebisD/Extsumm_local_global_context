the complex molecular architecture and novel cytotoxic profile of apoptolidin a has stimulated considerable interest from the synthetic community.(7 ) total syntheses of the fully glycosylated ensemble , apoptolidin a , have been reported by the groups of nicolaou and koert.(8 ) several groups including our own have described the synthesis of apoptolidinone ( a).(9 ) we describe herein the total synthesis of apoptolidinones a and d and evaluation of their antiproliferative properties .
seto and hayakawa initiated a cell - based screening program aimed at the identification of new genotype - selective cytotoxic agents from microbial extracts.(1 ) in 1993 the seto group reported the isolation of apoptolidin , a 20-membered macrolide found to induce apoptosis in rat glia cells transformed with the adenovirus oncogene and produced by nocardiopsis sp .
not surprisingly , the reported cell - selective induction of apoptosis by apoptolidin a stimulated investigations on several research fronts in order to better understand the reported cell - selective cytotoxicity . khosla and co - workers determined that apoptolidin a and structurally related cytotoxic macrolides ossamycin and cytovaricin inhibit mitochondrial f0f1-atpase , identifying this enzyme as a promising target for the development of cell - selective anticancer agents.(4 ) the apoptolidins have proven to be rather labile compounds easily subjected to a base - induced acyl migration from the c19 to c20 hydroxyl group to produce isoapoptolidins ( figure 1),(5 ) compounds possessing diminished activity against mitochondrial f0f1-atpase . the molecular complexity and instability of apoptolidin a has led wender and co - workers to search for semisynthetic analogs possessing superior stability and/or pharmacokinetic properties.(6 ) comparison of the enzyme inhibition of mitochondrial f0f1-atpase to antiproliferative activity in e1a - transformed rat fibroblasts of apoptolidin a derived analogs suggested either the existence of a secondary biological target or a more complex mode of action .
