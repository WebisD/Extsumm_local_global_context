this preliminary study of analysis of pcbs and chlorinated pesticides in various adipose tissues obtained from seven human subjects is a first attempt to determine whether the distributions of several pcb congeners and several chlorinated pesticides are the same in different adipose tissues .
contrary to expectations that patterns of various pesticides and pcb congeners were not as similar as expected when comparing levels in serum , subcutaneous , visceral , retroperitoneal , and pelvic fat .
of the 23 pesticides monitored , none of the samples showed levels of aldrin ,  and  chlordane ,  and  hch , endosulfan ii , endosulfan sulfate , ddd , ddt , endrin aldehyde , or methoxychlor above the level of quantitation , while for pcb congeners levels of pcbs 47 and 171 were not found in any tissue at concentrations above the levels of quantitation .  
these results indicate that care should be taken when assuming that serum levels of pops reflect patterns found in lipid stores throughout the body .
seven human subjects scheduled for elective surgery for either benign lesions or cancer provided informed consent for the surgical team to obtain blood and fat biopsies from several different fat compartments at the time of surgery for analysis of ten pcb congeners and 22 chlorinated pesticides .
