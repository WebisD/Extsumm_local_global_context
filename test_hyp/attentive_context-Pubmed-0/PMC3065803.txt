although only a small , but significant , elevated risk for childhood asthma and antenatal steroid exposure was demonstrated in the current study , further research into the smallest possible dose required for the steroid to achieve the desired post - natal effect could be undertaken potentially limiting the long term consequences such as childhood asthma .
research on the etiology and natural history of asthma has identified a web of predisposing factors ( e.g. , genetics , atopy ) , causal factors that may sensitize the airways ( e.g. , animal dander , dust mites , workplace allergens ) and contributing factors ( perinatal events such as mode of delivery , exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy , gestational age and childhood respiratory infections , air quality , socioeconomic status , and pollution )   . conclusions that can be drawn from this research outline a myriad of exposures and complex interactions in the etiology of pediatric asthma   . given the complex nature of pediatric asthma etiology , factors in the perinatal period that would predispose individuals to asthma are of particular interest   .
when considering the more conservative definition of asthma the pattern of early childhood risk for the development of asthma after antenatal exposure to corticosteroids remains the same as with the main asthma definition . as expected with this definition the risk estimate , particularly in the early childhood period
