upon obtaining an institutional review board approval , we performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent rc and urinary diversion ( ud ) by a single surgical team between 1992 and 2011 .
the advantages and disadvantages of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( nac ) and adjuvant chemotherapy ( ac ) are discussed in table 1 .
patients with mibc are more likely to initiate and complete the planned number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as compared to adjuvant chemotherapy . therefore , we advocate administration of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in patients who are likely to benefit from chemotherapy .
neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer : advantages and disadvantages after a decision is made to administer chemotherapy , to achieve maximum benefit the planned regimen should be initiated and the planned number of cycles must be completed at an optimal dosage . however , due to various reasons chemotherapy is often not initiated or it is initiated but not completed . the aim of our study is to evaluate and compare the likelihood of initiating and completing neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with mibc .
patients who were offered nac were more likely to initiate ( p < 0.001 ) and complete ( p < 0.001 ) chemotherapy [ figure 1 ] .
