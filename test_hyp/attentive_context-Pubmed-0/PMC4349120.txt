the aim of this study was to verify the influence of voxel size on the accuracy and reproducibility of linear measurements of the mandible performed without metallic markers on 3d cbct images , comparing multiplanar sections and 3d rendering images .
linear measurements obtained on multiplanar 2d cbct images with 0.2 and 0.4 voxel sizes using i - cat scanner and dolphin software are reliable and accurate for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning .
reducing the voxel size from 0.4 to 0.2 mm does not influence the accuracy and reliability of measurements of large craniofacial structures on cbct-3d images .
