the results of this study suggest that right - sided haldn may be preferable for living donor nephrectomy in patients with significantly lower function in the right kidney than in the left one .
the aim of this study , therefore , was to report the safety and feasibility of right - sided haldn .
between may 2006 and may 2009 , 16 patients underwent right - sided haldn in our institution , by the same operator , who had experienced more than 500 cases of open donor nephrectomies and more than 300 cases of left - sided haldns .
right - sided haldn is safe and technically feasible in donors and shows a favorable graft outcome .
the numbers of right renal arteries of the 16 patients were as follows : single renal artery ( n=13 ) , single renal artery with an early branching artery that supplied the upper pole of kidney ( n=2 ) , and duplicated renal artery ( n=1 ) .
the mean serum creatinine level on day 28 was satisfactory in the recipients ( 1.160.18 mg / dl ) .
the numbers of right renal veins of the patients were as follows : single renal vein ( n=15 ) , duplicated renal vein ( n=1 ) .
