we have described a new , high - value aspect of on - chip methylation analysis through osmium - dna complexation . an icon probe fixed onto a microwell formed a crosslink with the target 5-methylcytosine and assisted the detection using pcr amplification .
this function will be effective for the capture of methylated dna on a chip for sequence - selective methylation analysis . in this paper , development of an on - chip analyzing method for typing of dna methylation at a specific cytosine
icon probes form a crosslink with a specific 5-methylcytosine in the probe - hybridizing dna mediated by osmium - centered complex formation .
icon probes fixed to the bottom of microwells assisted the on - chip detection of the methylation status of a specific cytosine in the target dna .
although there remain further aspects to be examined toward realizing an easier - to - use methylation analysis , such as optimization of pcr conditions suitable for icon , this on - chip assay supported by the chemical basis could be an important component of the next generation of high - throughput methylation analyses .
the sequence - selective dna methylation - detection probe , icon ( interstrand complexes formed by osmium and nucleic acids ) , may be effective for the development of an on - chip analysis of dna methylation   . in the presence of osmium oxidants and a bipyridine ligand ,
