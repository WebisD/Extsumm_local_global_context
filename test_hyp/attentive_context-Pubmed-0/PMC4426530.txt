there is one reported case where vertebral artery compression of the medulla led to intractable nausea and vomiting .
a 69-year - old woman presented with a 10-month history of intractable nausea and vomiting resulting in a 50 pound weight loss .
this case demonstrated the importance of neurological investigations in the isolated intractable vomiting patient without a clear evidence of peripheral cause and including a central nervous system etiology on the differential , and the role of mvd in achieving cure .
intractable nausea and vomiting are very rare symptoms of medullary compression and there are approximately less than 10 cases reported in the literature of the aforementioned symptomatology mostly due to tumors .
the first mvd was performed in 1966 by dr peter jannetta to relieve the facial pain in a patient with a compressed trigeminal nerve .
she had an extensive medical workup at multiple outside hospitals including a comprehensive gastrointestinal workup which was significant for celiac disease .
her pertinent past medical history includes a history of breast cancer , mastectomy , and cholecystectomy . during her evaluation by the gastroenterologists at our hospital ,
patients with central lesions often wait months or years and undergo countless tests before a central etiology is added to the differential diagnosis because most cases do not present with localizing neurological deficits
