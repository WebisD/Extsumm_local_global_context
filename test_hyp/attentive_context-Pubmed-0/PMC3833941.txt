the purpose of this paper is to present current perspectives on the prevention of pph , particularly in resource poor - settings , where pph is the leading cause of maternal mortality.3 we reviewed historical events and the current evidence related to pph prevention and highlight the progress in policy and program implementation to reduce this disease .
we reviewed the current strategies being implemented to prevent pph , ranging from active management of the third stage of labor ( amtsl ) in health facilities to the use of misoprostol in home births , which was given particular attention .
in addition , we looked at challenges to the implementation and scale - up of these interventions , as well as examples of ongoing efforts that could be positions as opportunities to increase access to pph prevention interventions .
do not present with any of the risk factors typically associated with the complication.6 consequently , pph is an obstetric complication that requires effective preventive interventions , tailored to the diverse needs of women and providers in resource - poor settings .
using pubmed , we conducted a review of the literature on randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) of interventions to prevent pph .
