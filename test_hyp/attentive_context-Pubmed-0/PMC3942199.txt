, we used the red leds and ultraviolet - b ( uv - b ) radiation as additional light sources for the process of plant cultivation in the laboratory to determine the role of the different qualities of light source on growth and photosynthetic characteristics of mung bean .
however , the red leds treatment caused a significant increase ( p < 0.05 ) of the values of plant height , fresh weight , dry weight , and root length compared with that of the ordinary fluorescent light for 40th day . with the uv - b radiation for 40th day , an obvious decrease ( p < 0.05 ) of plant height was observed , while it induced a marked increase ( p < 0.05 ) in fresh weight , dry weight , and stem diameter .
however , a significant decrease ( p < 0.05 ) was observed in the values of the photosynthetic characteristics of the uv - b radiation for 40th day .
uv - b radiation - treated seedlings resulted in a notably increase in the concentrations of uv - absorbing compounds for the two durations ( p < 0.05 ) .
the concentrations of chl a and chl b may affect the values of the photosynthetic characteristics to a certain extent . it was obvious that the red leds treatment induced statistically significant increases ( p < 0.05 ) not only in the values of the photosynthetic characteristics ( table 3 ) but also in the concentrations of chl a and chl b ( figure 1 ) for the two durations . compared with the ordinary fluorescent light , the uv - b radiation did not cause significant differences . with the treatment of uv - b radiation , the concentrations of uv - absorbing compounds
