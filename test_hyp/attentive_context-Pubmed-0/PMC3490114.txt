here we have described an extremely rare case of unicentric castleman 's disease of the plasma cell type arising in the renal sinus .
although preoperative diagnosis of castleman 's disease is difficult and accurate diagnosis is only possible by histopathologic evaluation , it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal sinus tumors .
a 64-year - old man visited our hospital with the chief complaint of microscopic hematuria for the past 2 months .
the occurrence of castleman 's disease in the renal sinus is exceedingly rare.1 to the best of our knowledge , only a few cases have been reported.1,3 - 6 the clinicopathological characteristics of the reported cases , involving six males and one female , are summarized in table 1 .
three months after the operation , there was no evidence of disease recurrence on follow - up abdominal ct .
these histological and immunohistochemical findings were compatible with a diagnosis of castleman 's disease of the plasma cell type .
five cases were of the plasma cell type , one of the hyaline vascular type and one of mixed type . the patient in the present case , a 64-year - old male , presented with symptoms of microscopic hematuria , and his disease was histologically classified as plasma cell type and clinically as unicentric type .
