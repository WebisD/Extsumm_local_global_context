although severe complications occur in some patients , the iatrogenic pneumopericardium is self - limiting and requires no specific therapy.2 ) we discuss a case of iatrogenic pneumopericardium in a young man who underwent pericardiocentesis due to tuberculous pericardial effusion .
a 20-year - old man was referred to the hospital with extensive pericardial effusion on a computed tomography .
pneumopericardium is defined as the presence of air - fluid level in the pericardial sac and has been reported to result from a spontaneous or iatrogenic cause of underlying disease.1 ) it is a rare condition but is important in the differential diagnosis of chest pain .
posteroanterior chest radiographs typically reveal air - fluid level and a radiolucency of air surrounding the cardiac boarder is outlined by a fine line representing the pericardial sac .
the current case showed that pneumopericardium is a rare complication of pericardiocentesis , which occurs as a result of a leaky drainage system or direct pleura - pericardial communication .
the patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis for 2 years and had taken anti - tuberculosis medication for the past 8 months .
follow up chest radiographs showed a new lucent outline around the heart with a clear lung , representing the existence of air - fluid level in the pericardial space ( fig .
