regardless of the framework for research , the personal characteristics of a researcher play a very important role in the quality of the research .
currently , we face a shortage of talented researchers in clinical medicine to take up future challenges.48 large amounts of money are invested in research , and there are strict requirements for the research process with regard to preparing funding applications and operational protocols
prevention and treatment of disease are the overarching goals of health research and thus the ultimate goal of our academic activity.13 it is important to keep this in mind , as academic success at an individual level is often measured solely in terms of publishing original peer - reviewed papers , defined by many as the  coin of the realm.4 the selection and training of future researchers are decisive factors in the quality of research .
our knowledge is limited about ways of selecting phd students and postdoctorals at the beginning of their research careers , who will produce the greatest value for society .
in recent years , this interest has grown to include identifying which doctoral candidates on the threshold of a postdoctoral program would develop into independent researchers with innovative research agendas , with the aptitude for establishing their own team of researchers , and with the ability to finance their own research.8 an essential criterion for success as a senior researcher is the ability to obtain support for their own research from peer - reviewed funding agencies . at the beginning of postdoctoral training , a clear picture starts to emerge of which postdoctorals formulate innovative research questions and which primarily conduct confirmative research .
