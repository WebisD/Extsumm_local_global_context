the aim of this study was to explore patient participants ' self - management practices and , in particular , how they impact their day - to - day lives and their motivation for engaging in self - management practices .
what all of the above studies lack is an indication of the motivators which influence the self - management strategies that people adopt ( i.e. , why they choose to self - manage in a given way ) and the impact of these strategies on the criteria that people living with t2d employ to measure the success of self - management practices .
this , in turn , affects the criteria that are used to judge the success of the self - management practices adopted and influences the style of self - management that people living with t2d engage in . if healthcare professionals wish to understand how and why people living with t2d self - manage in the ways that they do , we need to understand the interrelation of other factors , such as the health system , healthcare professionals , and the social and economic resources available to people .
the study 's research question(s ) are as follows.what motivates t2d patients to engage in self - management activities?how do t2d patients assess whether their self - management practices are successful or unsuccessful ? what motivates t2d patients to engage in self - management activities ?
