, ecls has well demonstrated its efficacy in treating in - hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and is being used for broader indications then before.2 ) the use of ecls after prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) , a traditional contraindication , is particularly challenging . here , we present two cases of emergency ecls after prolonged cpr for in - hospital cardiac arrest caused by refractory vf in patients with ami waiting for primary pci .
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation ( vt / vf ) in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) is associated with a poor prognosis.1 ) despite a better prognosis for early vt / vf compared to late vt / vf , early refractory vt / vf is a serious obstacle for the definitive treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) .
patients with ami complicated by refractory vf / vt before commencing primary pci would rarely survive or recover without ischemic brain damage .
one of the recent advances in the field of critical care is the extracorporeal life support ( ecls ) system , which is portable , readily applicable and easy to maintain . before its advent ,
prolonged cpr ( > 30 minutes ) or unwitnessed cardiac arrest are poor prognostic markers for the implementation of ecls.3 ) according to rhee et al.4 ) the time to ecls for in - hospital arrest or shock patients was 4323 minutes in failed weaning cases versus 258 minutes in successful weaning cases in korea . with this in mind ,
