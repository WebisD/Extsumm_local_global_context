in this study , we demonstrate that genetic background strongly influences the expression of lncrnas and their response to low - dose radiation by transcriptomic analysis of mouse mammary glands using microarrays that contain both lncrnas and coding rnas .
our results indicate lncrnas may exert a partial or key role in the regulation of coding rna expression induced by radiation .
moreover , the changes in the expression of lncrnas are significantly correlated with the expression of coding rnas , suggesting that lncrnas may coordinate the tissue response to radiation via regulation of coding mrnas .
however , the specific regulatory mechanism of this control requires further investigation , and knock - out and overexpression of the lncrna genes in mice and other model systems should be performed to increase our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in response to ldir .
however , the relevance of lncrnas in the cell and tissue response to ionizing radiation has not yet been characterized . in this study , we used agilent sureprint g3 microarrays to profile lncrna and mrna from mammary glands of balb / c mice 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after irradiation and of spret / eij mice 4 weeks after irradiation with 10  cgy of x - radiation .
