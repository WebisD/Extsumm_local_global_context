it is notable to mention that the hong kong avian a / teal / hong kong / w312/97 ( h6n1 ) and the human influenza virus a / hong kong/156/97 ( h5n1 ) showed a very high nucleotide homology in the 6 aiv internal genes , and especially in the n1 gene sequence   .
that phenomenon was supported by two observations ; ( a ) the absence of clinically - affected cases in adjacent poultry houses and ( b ) the detection of only three cases of aiv h6 in israel .
it seems that the h gene of the present isolate , a / turkey / israel/09 ( h6n1 ) , differed from the h genes of the two previous israeli isolates , as they belonged to different clades , although the differences in the nucleotide content were about 3.7 - 3.8% .
therefore , circulation of these viruses was concurrent with that of the highly prevalent h9n2 aiv in israel   .
the analysis includes representative aiv n1 genes compared on the respective gene fragment . while the compared sequences differed up to 31% , the present isolate , a / turkey / israel/09 ( h6n1 ) , was closest to the n1 from a / mute swan / aktau/06 ( h5n1 ) and a / swan / mangystau/06 ( h5n1 ) .
