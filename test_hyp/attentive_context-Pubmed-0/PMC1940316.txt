, we introduce a 
 novel image analysis method able to assess quantitatively the 
 relationship between imaging and electrophysiological data . in 
 section 4
a better 
 understanding of the relationship between functional and 
 electrophysiological data might lead to new approaches in epilepsy 
 surgery and will likely improve clinical management of a large 
 number of patients suffering from intractable epilepsy .
with ever - improving imaging technologies and high - performance 
 computational power , the complexity and scale of brain imaging 
 data have continued to grow at an explosive pace .
although this 
 is an area of active research , current state - of - the - art 
 technologies are still suboptimal with respect to multimodality 
 integration and quantitative assessment of qualitatively distinct 
 neuroimaging datasets in patients with structurally abnormal 
 brains .
this paper presents a multimodality database for 
 neuroimaging , electrophysiological , as well as clinical data 
 specifically designed for the assessment of epileptic foci in 
 patients with epilepsy , and can serve as a standard template for 
 other diagnostic procedures which employ multiple imaging 
 technologies .
recent advances 
 in imaging technologies , such as molecular imaging using positron 
 emission tomography ( pet ) , structural imaging using 
 high - resolution magnetic resonance ( mr ) , as well as quantitative 
 electrophysiological cortical mapping using electroencephalography 
 ( eeg ) , have allowed an increased understanding of normal and 
 abnormal brain structures and functions   it is well 
 understood that normal brain function is dependent on the 
 interactions between specialized regions of the brain which 
 process information within local and global networks .
