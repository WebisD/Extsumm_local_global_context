therefore , this study was undertaken to identify the determinants of prevailing misconceptions on diabetes and the management of diabetic patients registered at a diabetes clinic of a tertiary care hospital in the eastern region of saudi arabia .
the strongest determinants of the misconceptions in our study population are female gender , rural area of residence , illiteracy or little education , < 5 or > 15 years since diagnosis , no self - monitoring of blood glucose , poor diet control and no education about diabetes .
it shows that female gender , living in a rural area , little or no education , < 5 or > 15 years since diagnosis , lack of self - monitoring , poor compliance with dietary control and no diabetes education were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) associated with moderate or high misconception score .
we conclude that myths and misconceptions about diabetes and its management are common in our patients .
frequency of respondents with misconceptions about etiology , types , pathogenesis and day - to - day life of diabetes ( n=200 ) table 2 illustrates the distribution of respondents according to misconceptions about diet .
