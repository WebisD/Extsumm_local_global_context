dfsp is a rare , slow growing , locally invasive cutaneous neoplasm of fibrohistiocytic origin with intermediate grade malignancy with an incidence between 0.85.0 cases per 1 million persons per year .
a 23-year - old female presented with an asymptomatic , erythematous , atrophic macule on the upper right side of her back that increased gradually in size within the last four years without any symptoms ( figure 1a ) . on physical examination the surface of the lesion was smooth and no induration was examined on palpation .
the atrophic presentation of dfsp is the rarest variant of this infrequent neoplasm , which was first described in 1985 .
the non - protuberant dfsp can be considered the early clinical stage of dfsp before developing the typical protuberant feature unless it remains as a non - protuberant tumor that is called atrophic dfsp .
atrophic dfsp should be kept in the differential diagnosis for atrophic and depressed skin lesions , particularly those seen on the trunks of women .
dermatoscopic evaluation of the lesion using 3gen dermlite - ii pro hr and documented with dermlite - foto 3gen ( llc , dana point , ca , usa ) showed a homogenous pigment network on a purplish erythematous background ( figure 1b ) .
