dopa - responsive dystonia ( drd ) is characterized by childhood - onset dystonia and a dramatic and sustained response to administration of low - doses of oral levodopa .
this disorder typically presents with gait disturbance , caused by lower limb dystonia with diurnal variation , a positive family history , and gradual progression to generalized dystonia .
a ten - year - old girl was brought with complaints of difficulty in walking and stiffness of both lower limbs , for the past six months .
children with recent onset dystonia and gait abnormalities may pose a diagnostic challenge . a careful history and focused neurological examination , looking for diurnal variation in symptoms , holds the key in arriving at the diagnosis .
in such children a therapeutic response to levodopa might be a safe and appropriate way of confirming drd .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri brain and spine were normal . in view of the typical diurnal variation of dystonia , a therapeutic challenge with levodopa / carbidopa was tried and there was a dramatic decrease in dystonia within two days and the child 's gait improved .
reported series , administration of low - dose levodopa had resulted in complete to near - complete recovery of symptoms in a cohort of chinese patients , with no significant long - term side effects . in our case ,
