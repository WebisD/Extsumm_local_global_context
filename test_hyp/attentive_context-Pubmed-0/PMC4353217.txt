considering the importance of creativity in nursing and the role of nurses in health care organizations , this study aimed to determine the iranian nurses perceptions and experiences of creativity in clinical settings and the outcomes of their creativity for health care organizations .
data analysis resulted in identifying four main themes : a ) improvement in patients quality of care , b ) improvement in nurses quality of work , personal and social life , c ) promotion of organization and d ) unpleasant outcomes .
therefore , considering the existing evidence in iran and lack of comprehensive study on the nurses creativity , this study explores the perception and experiences of creative nurses about outcomes of their creativity in clinical settings in the cultural context of iran .
a qualitative approach using content analysis was adopted for this study to facilitate a rich description of the understanding and experiences of creative clinical nurses about outcomes or consequences of creativity in health care settings in an iranian context .
hence , the results of this study are predominantly representative of the group of creative nurses who participated in this study and can not be generalized to all nurses
results from this study can be used to establish guidelines on how to foster creativity in health care professionals , especially practical nurses and nursing students as future nurses . moreover , as this is a qualitative study , the study group is in no way a representative sample .
