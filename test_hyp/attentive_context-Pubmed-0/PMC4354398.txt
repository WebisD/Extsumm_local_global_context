further , we repeatedly observed that the majority of patients had low sputum concentrations of amoxicillin ( < mic90 ) , suggesting that current treatment with antibiotics should be optimized .
multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no significant relationship between beta - lactamase activity and sputum amoxicillin concentrations < mic90 versus mic90 ( odds ratio 0.53 for a 0.1% increase in beta - lactamase activity ; 95% confidence interval 0.231.2 ; p=0.13 ) .
we observed no relationship between beta - lactamase activity and sputum amoxicillin concentration ( < mic90 or mic90 ) in patients treated with amoxicillin / clavulanic acid for an acute exacerbation in copd .
, there are several potential pathogens ( eg , h. influenza and m. catarrhalis ) that produce these beta - lactamase enzymes.19 the use of beta - lactamase inhibitors , such as clavulanic acid , allows inactivation of certain beta - lactamases.20 an excessive beta - lactamase activity in sputum of copd patients compared with the dosage of clavulanic acid could possibly be an explanation for the earlier observed low numbers of copd patients in which an amoxicillin concentration above the mic90 was reached .
we therefore conducted a study to investigate whether there was any difference in beta - lactamase activity between copd patients with a sputum amoxicillin concentration < mic90 and those with a concentration mic90 .
