( 2013 ) reported an overall accuracy of only 60% , suggesting that the approach selected , a leave - one - out classifier using a general linear model , may not be sufficiently powerful . in the present study
the relative importance of visual regions and occipital lobes probably reflects atypical function of the visual system in asd ( dakin and frith , 2005 ) rather than integrity .
autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) is a highly heterogeneous disorder , diagnosed on the basis of behavioral criteria . from the neurobiological perspective ,
cascio and colleagues ( 2012 ) found atypical activation patterns in adults with asd for pleasant and unpleasant tactile stimuli in the pcc and insula , which could reflect altered functional connectivity with the somatosensory cortex ( not tested in the cited study ) .
first , focusing on only the ten top features , for which an accuracy of 75% was achieved , we found that limbic ( left anterior cingulate ) , somatosensory ( postcentral gyri bilaterally ) , visual ( calcarine sulcus ) , and default mode ( right precuneus ) regions stood out ( supplementary fig . 
in this study , we used intrinsic functional connectivities between a set of functionally defined rois ( power et al . , 2011 ) for machine learning diagnostic classification of asd . while accuracy remained overall modest for pso - svm and rfe - svm approaches , it was high ( 91% ) for random forest .
