our experiments suggest that the classic fractal dimensions must be calculated under very strict conditions , and tiny changes on the images and vessel segmentation can cause significant variations
fd 's high sensitivity to the segmentation methods and thresholding techniques will be addressed by measuring fd directly from the vessel probability maps .
, we explain the pipeline for computing the fractal dimension , including four state - of - the - art vessel segmentation methods , the region of interest determination , and three classic fractal dimension calculation methods that are widely used in clinical studies . in section 4 the results of different cases
( 4 ) we explored the changes of fd in various regions of interest . ( 5 ) we tuned the segmentation threshold values to examine the influence of segmentation accuracy on the fractal measurements and ( 6 ) we compared the fractal dimensions that are calculated on the images acquired by different cameras .
( 1 ) we calculated the fd values in groups of subjects with various diabetic retinopathy grades , where the intergroup and intragroup variations are compared . ( 2 ) we calculated the fractal dimension on the manual vessel segmentation annotated by different human observers . ( 3 ) we investigated the stability of fd using different vessel segmentation methods .
