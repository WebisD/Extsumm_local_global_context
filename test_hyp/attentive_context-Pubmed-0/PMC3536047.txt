we describe and analyze the incorporation of faf technology in our community - based ocular screening program .
several investigators initiated studies examining the use of additional technologies and imaging modalities , including software - assisted digital filters , retinal thickness analyzer , and slit lamp microscopy to enhance the quality of obtained images aimed at improving detection and characterization of vision - threatening diseases ( vtds )   .
the feasibility and effectiveness of vision screening programs for detection of glaucoma , diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) , cataracts , age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) have been described   .
in the subject with amd , faf imaging provided more detail than color imaging in terms of the extent of rpe disturbance ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) . in an individual with chronic csr , although we were able to appreciate a circular lesion nasal to the fovea in the color photograph , the faf image was superior at characterizing the full extent of this lesion ( e.g. , rpe hyperfluorescence ) ( figures 2(g ) and 2(h ) ) . in the case of ocular trauma ,
screening participants included homeless and working - poor individuals at soup kitchens and churches in essex county , new jersey .
