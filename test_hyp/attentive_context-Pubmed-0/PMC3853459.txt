a retrospective chart review was performed for cases of infectious scleritis seen from january 2007 to august 2011 .
twelve eyes of 12 patients were identified to have culture - positive infectious scleritis . demographic data and clinical features
preceding surgical procedures performed included manual small - incision cataract surgery ( 4 ) , pterygium excision ( 1 ) , and trabeculectomy ( 1 ) .
another case series of indian eyes also showed maximum number of their cases had cataract surgery prior to an episode of infectious scleritis .
manual small incision cataract surgery is a common predisposing factor to infectious scleritis in developing countries .
a clinical suspicion of infectious scleritis in all cases of scleral inflammation following trauma has been emphasized previously .
, one patient ( case 2 ) had progeria , another had chronic liver disease ( case 6 ) , and 2 patients had diabetes ( case 8 and 10 ) .
patients with multifocal scleritis were associated with growth of either gram - negative bacilli ( gnb ) or nocardia on culture an example of which is shown in fig .
six months after corneo - scleral patch graft following infectious scleritis post - cataract surgery ( case 8) we determined the prognostic factors of infectious scleritis using the chi - square test .
