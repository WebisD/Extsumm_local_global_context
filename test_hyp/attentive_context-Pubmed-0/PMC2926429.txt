effective communication between the operator and anesthesiologist is essential when unexpected complications are encountered to facilitate the prompt planning of coping strategies .
the reasons for the delayed diagnosis in the present case were that the reduction in oxygen saturation and the diminished right lung sounds were mistakenly attributed to airway obstruction by a foreign body .
rothmann and boeckman   reported that the probability of pneumothorax during rigid bronchoscopy for the removal of a foreign body is approximately 1% .
ventilating bronchoscopy has the risk of severe complications , such as , infection , laryngeal edema , laryngospasm , bronchospasm , bleeding , hypoxia , pneumomediastinum , and pneumothorax .
summarizing , the tension pneumothorax should be considered when inspiratory pressure is increased and oxygen saturation is decreased during ventilating bronchoscopy .
therefore , the possibility of pneumothorax should be suspected when ventilation worsens during ventilating bronchoscopy . however , an early diagnosis of pneumothorax during anesthesia is not easy because the symptom is masked by anesthesia .
tension pneumothorax during surgery may manifest as a reduction in oxygen saturation , a rapid increase in airway pressure , hypotension , and/or tachycardia . in this case ,
furthermore , it would have been safer to evaluate airway with a fiberoptic bronchoscope inserted through the endotracheal tube under ventilation rather than attempt airway assessment using a ventilating bronchoscope after extubation . during surgery on the trachea and bronchus , a double lumen endotracheal tube or
