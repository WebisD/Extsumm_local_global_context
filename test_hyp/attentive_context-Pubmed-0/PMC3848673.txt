transfusion of rbcs was associated with postoperative increased serum creatinine and urea , decreased glomerular filtration rate , acute kidney insufficiency , and acute kidney failure . the storage time was associated with acute kidney insufficiency , but not with acute kidney failure .
concerning acute kidney insufficiency , there was a significant difference between group 1 and group 2 ( p = 0.042 ) , group 5 and group 6 ( p=0.028 ) , and between group 7 and group 8 ( p < 0.01 ) .
patients were pooled in different groupsdepending on storage time ( group 1 - group 6 ) and amount of rbc transfusions ( group 7 and 8) .
therefore , the purpose of this retrospective observational cohort study was to focus on the impact of storage time and amount of transfused red blood cells on renal function .
there was a significant correlation of postoperative pathological serum creatinine ( p<0.01 ) , gfr ( p<0.01 ) , and urea ( p<0.01 ) with the amount of transfused rbcs ( group 7 vs 8) but not with the storage time ( comparing groups 1 - 6 ) ( table 4 ) .
based on these findings , on recent international literature , and on the increasing problem of distributing the rare resource of human blood , it is mandatory to develop an evidence - based transfusion trigger for cardiac surgery patients .
