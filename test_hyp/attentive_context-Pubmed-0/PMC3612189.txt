the results of the present study showed differences in force levels during loading and unloading between the five brands of -ti wires under study after 1.5 mm of deflection ; res , cna and beta wires exhibited different force deflection behaviors in comparison with the two products of ormco company ( tmal and hone ) .

 the results of the present study showed differences in force levels during loading and unloading between the five brands of -ti wires under study after 1.5 mm of deflection ; res , cna and beta wires exhibited different force deflection behaviors in comparison with the two products of ormco company ( tmal and hone).there are different changes in load - deflection characteristics of various -ti wires after sterilization with dry heat and heated steam.the clinicians who want to provide maximum safety for their patients can sterilize res , tmal and cna wires in an autoclave without any worries before placing them in the oral cavity . 
 
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of sterilization with dry heat and steam on load - deflection characteristics of -ti wires , with different brands .
the results of the present study did not show any effect of steam sterilization ( autoclave ) [ figures 26 ] on load - deflection characteristics of the majority of -ti wires tested ; however , it increased force levels during loading and unloading of beta and unloading of hone wires , which is reflected by an increased slope of loading and unloading of beta and unloading of hone wires [ figures 2 and 5 ]
