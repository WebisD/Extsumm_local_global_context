the above discussed glomerular and tubular function markers are effective in proper assessment of renal function tests . these markers act as an indicator of biological , pathologic processes , or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention .
national institute of health ( nih ) 2001 defined a biomarker as " a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological , pathologic processes , or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention . as markers of renal function creatinine , urea , uric
biochemical markers play an important role in accurate diagnosis and also for assessing risk and adopting therapy that improves clinical outcome . over decades research and utilization of biomarkers has evolved substantially .
electrolyte panel is frequently used to screen for an electrolyte or acid - base imbalance and to monitor the effect of treatment on a known imbalance that is affecting bodily organ function .
the test for electrolytes includes the measurement of sodium , potassium , chloride , and bicarbonate for both diagnosis and management of renal , endocrine , acid - base , water balance , and many other conditions .
estimation of proteinuria helps in differentiating between tubulointerstitial and glomerular diseases and also to follow the progress of renal disease and to assess the response to therapy .
