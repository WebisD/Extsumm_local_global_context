early detection of a hearing problem with a diagnostic tool like newborn hearing screening test is important .
although auditory neuropathy manifests as various patterns in pure tone and speech audiometry , most patients have very poor word discrimination function.1 ) we present a case of auditory neuropathy improved in a child who was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss by abr testing at 16 months of age , but who presented normal pure tone threshold and speech discrimination score 3 years after wearing hearing aids .
auditory neuropathy is characterized by abnormal auditory brainstem response ( abr ) and normal otoaoustic emission ( oae ) responses .
a six - year - old boy presented to the outpatient clinic with abnormalities of hearing and language development .
early detection can bring improvements in hearing ability and language development of children by promoting the use of rehabilitation strategies including hearing aid and cochlear implant .
the patient in the present case also showed typical clinical features of auditory neuropathy including non - response for abr in addition to normal oae results .
the concept of auditory neuropathy was first introduced by starr , et al.1 ) in 1996 to describe 10 patients , including infants and adolescents , showing normal oae results , abnormal abr results and poor speech discrimination score .
