we describe a rare case of conjoint bicondylar hoffa fracture where both the femoral condyles were joined by a bridge of intact bone adjacent to the intercondylar notch . to the best of our knowledge ,
only one case of such an injury has been reported in a child.7 previously published reports of bicondylar hoffa fractures
bicondylar hoffa fracture involving both the femoral condyles is a rare injury and has anecdotally been reported in the literature [ table 1].234567 most reported cases of bicondylar hoffa fracture have two separate fracture lines and the two condyles are separated from each other .
albert hoffa first described this fracture in 1904.1 these fractures usually involve the lateral femoral condyle .
a 17-year - old male labourer presented to orthopaedic emergency with the complaint of acute pain and swelling in his right knee following trauma .
the swashbukler ( modified anterior ) approach allows excellent exposure of both the condyles . anatomic reduction and rigid internal fixation allows early mobilization and excellent long term outcome .
, we described a rare case of a conjoint bicondylar hoffa fracture managed successfully by open reduction and internal fixation with good clinical outcome at 18 months of followup .
