, we report an advanced case of constrictive pericarditis associated with end - stage - renal disease and follow with a literature review .
a 27-year - old armenian man with a history of hypertension , end - stage - renal disease on hemodialysis , and recently diagnosed ccp presented to our hospital with massive ascites , dyspnea , and hypotension .
moreover , ccp is commonly confused with other diagnoses such as end - stage - liver failure , idiopathic cardiomyopathy , and restrictive cardiomyopathy . in our case presentation
both the etiology and physiology of constrictive pericarditis are reviewed and it is of value for clinicians to consider esrd as an underlying cause in their workup of constrictive pericarditis after first ruling out other more common etiologies .
the cause of 60% of cases of ccp is unknown and is labeled as idiopathic .
pericardial involvement in end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) is manifested most commonly as acute uremic or dialysis pericarditis and infrequently as chronic constrictive pericarditis .
the serous layer is also divided into two parts , the parietal pericardium which is intimately fused to the fibrous pericardium and   also the visceral pericardium which is a part of the epicardium . in between the visceral and parietal pericardium is a thin potential space consisting of 2030  cc of serous fluid that fills a potential space known as the pericardial cavity . in the case of ccp , the fibrotic pericardium thickens and forms a noncompliant casing surrounding the heart .
