gum - elastic bougie is the easiest and cheapest tool used in case of an unexpected difficult intubation occurring in the operating room .
management of an unexpectedly difficult airway consists of laryngeal mask ventilation , gum - elastic bougie and video laryngoscopy - assisted intubation .
a difficult airway has been described in patients with a variety of endocrine disorders , including pituitary diseases , but not with hypogonadism . there may be an unrevealed relationship between hypogonadism and difficult airway .
. failed endotracheal intubation and inadequate ventilation with insufficient oxygenation may lead to serious complications , even death .
gum - elastic bougie is still the most attainable and effective tool in the operation room in this situation .
thus , anesthesiologists must take into account difficult airway in endocrinological disorders like hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and be prepared for difficult intubation .
a difficult airway has been described in patients with pituitary endocrine disorders such as acromegaly and dwarfism ; however , airway problems with hypogonadism have not been well identified in the literature.2
