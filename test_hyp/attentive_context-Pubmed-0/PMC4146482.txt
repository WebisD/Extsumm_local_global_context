the purpose of this short - term study is to evaluate and compare the impact of various transepithelial riboflavin delivery protocols on the corneal epithelium in regard to pain and epithelial integrity in the early postoperative period .
minimum corneal thickness was 335  m in group 1 , 396  m in group 2 , 367  m in group 3 , 442  m in group 4 , 377  m in group 5 , and 460  m in group 6 , respectively .
one hundred and sixty - six eyes of 104 subjects affected by progressive keratoconus underwent transepithelial cxl between 05/2011 and 12/2013 at the center for refractive surgery , st .
corneal collagen cross - linking ( cxl ) is the only conservative therapy for keratoconus that has been demonstrated to stiffen the cornea and halt the progression of the ectasia .
the two - stage application appeared to be a near optimal protocol with respect to epithelial integrity , resulting in zero incidences of postoperative epithelial defects in group 5 and a reduction in the percentage of eyes experiencing postoperative pain ( 0% ) as compared to the use of paracel alone ( 83% ) .
oct evaluation was comparable between the remaining groups , with deeper reaching hyperreflectivity observed in the corneal stroma in the postoperative period in groups 26 .
