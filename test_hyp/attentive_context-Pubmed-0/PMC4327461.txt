the rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups : control group , irradiated group , sodium selenite group and sodium selenite / irradiated group .
under this experimental conditions it was concluded that despite the alterations observed in the sodium selenite group , sodium selenite has a radioprotective action on the secretory cells of submandibular glands .
therefore , the aim of this study was to perform an ultrastructural evaluation of the radioprotective effect of sodium selenite on the damage caused by gamma radiation on the submandibular gland secretory cells in rats .
the other groups were divided into 6 sub - groups in accordance with the time of removal of the submandibular gland after irradiation : 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 and 72 h. the animals belonging to the sodium selenite and sodium selenite / irradiated groups received 0.5 mg / kg body weight of sodium selenite ( merck kgaa , darmstadt , germany ) intraperitoneally and saline was administered to the others .
h after irradiation , the intensity of the alterations in the two types of cells in the irradiated group , was greater , with more tissue destruction and disorganization ( figure 3a ) .
