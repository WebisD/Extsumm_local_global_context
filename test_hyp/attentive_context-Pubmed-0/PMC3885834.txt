thus , the aim of 
 the present study was to compare the lumbar flexion angle and trunk muscle activity in 
 individuals with and without limited hip flexion rom during vdt work with a cross - legged 
 sitting position .
based on previous findings , we consider that the kinematic 
 data of the lumbar spine and emg data of the trunk muscles during vdt work with cross - legged 
 sitting for short periods may provide meaningful information for individuals who prefer 
 cross - legged sitting .
the general characteristics of the subjects in the control group ( mean age 25.1  
 1.5  years ; mean weight 62.6  5.7  kg ; mean height 171.9  6.9  cm ) and the experimental group 
 ( mean age 23.6  1.5  years ; mean weight 67.4  4.1  kg ; mean height 175.1  4.5  cm ) were not 
 significantly different ( p > 0.05 ) , except for the hip flexion rom ( 123.6  2.4 
 versus 102.5  3.8 ; p < 0.001 ) .
the lumbar flexion angle was significantly greater in the experimental group compared with 
 the control group during vdt work with cross - legged sitting ( p = 0.017 ) ( table 1table 1 .
subjects with more than 120 of right hip 
 flexion rom ( one female , six males ) were classified into the control group , and subjects 
 with no more than 110 of right hip flexion rom ( eight males ) were classified into the 
 experimental group .
