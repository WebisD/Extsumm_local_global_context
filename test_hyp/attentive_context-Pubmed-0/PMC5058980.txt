this data could provide evidence of a connection between oral diseases and the frequency of oral micro - organisms in valve samples .
considering the recent findings , the aim of this study is to identify cariogenic and periodontopathogenic micro - organisms in the dental plaque , saliva , and cardiac valves of patients undergoing valve replacement surgery , regardless of the disease , in order to contribute with epidemiologic data regarding the presence of oral bacteria in cardiac valves . detailed evaluation of oral health status of all patients , including presentation of caries and periodontal disease history , by dental examination , will also be reported .
this finding may be related to the great previous experience of dental caries among the participants of the present study and s. mutans possible ability to survive in the bloodstream and attach to extracellular matrix components .
the detection rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular samples was superior to the detection rate of periodontopathic bacteria .
. the evaluation of the expression of different biomarkers ( inflammatory , thrombotic , and osteogenic ) in human heart valves affected with chronic diseases and its correlation with the presence and frequency of oral bacteria in those samples may provide a positive association between the infection and the intensity of the local inflammatory process .
