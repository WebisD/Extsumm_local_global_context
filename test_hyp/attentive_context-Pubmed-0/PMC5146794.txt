, we investigated the time - ordered changes of pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic factors to determine the role of the upr signaling pathway in cognitive decline of 5fad mice
in 5fad mice , we observed that neuronal loss and cleaved caspase-3 increase at the age of 12 months , cognitive deficit at the age of 7 months and 12 months .
consistently , in our study , the deposit of intra- and extra - neuronal a increased with age in 5fad brain ; neuronal loss in cortical layer 5 was observed at 12 months of age ; however , before significant neuron loss , impaired memory of 5fad mice at 7 months of age was monitored in the morris water maze .
interestingly , at the age of 2-month - old 5fad mice , the related factors involved in the ers - associated upr pathway , including chop , cleaved caspase-12 , grp 78 , and syvn1 , were significantly increased compared with those in age - matched wt mice .
our previous study has also shown that cognitive impairment present in 5fad mice was accompanied by structural degradation of synapses and decreased expression of synaptophysin and psd95 in the brain at the age of 67 months . under physiological conditions , approximately one - third of proteins in the er are assembled abnormally and do not form mature proteins .
