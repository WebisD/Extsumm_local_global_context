notably , we identified 8 patients with blood samples that tested positive for the presence of both chikv and denv-2 genomes , indicating co - infection of these patients by both viruses .
taken together , these findings document chikv and denv-2 co - circulation that resulted in large simultaneous outbreaks in regions where ae .
we report an arboviral outbreak that occurred in gabon , central africa , from march through july 2007 , which showed the unexpected extent of the spread of ae .
extrapolation of this result suggests that the total number of denv-2 patients who are superinfected with chikv is likely to be high , which suggests that denv-2 infection is not the antagonist for a secondary chikv infection .
in contrast , only 3% of chikv+ patients were also denv-2 + ; however , the starting period of time of infection or the sequence of infection by the 2 viruses can not be assessed .
our study therefore provides a disconcerting example of the unexpected epidemiologic patterns that may be associated with the dispersal of both vectors ( ae . albopictus and ae .
we also describe its association with atypical epidemiologic characteristics such as the co - circulation of chikv and denv-2 and the frequency of human co - infections . the outbreak centered on the capital of gabon ; peaked from april through may 2007 , in the heat of the long wet season ; and subsequently moved north , where the virus sequentially reached several small towns along the route to northern gabon and cameroon ( figure 1 ) .
