we conclude and recommend that , from hemodynamics and respiratory perspective , higher dose dexmedetomidine was well tolerated and is effective to use for successful completion of mri , in the majority of pediatric patients .
were required in 117 ( 21.5% ) for spontaneous movements to avoid motion artifacts that can compromise mri quality ( 54 patients with one - time bolus and 43 patients with two boluses ) .
high dose dexmedetomidine is an attractive and effective medication in children for mri sedation . when using high dose dexmedetomidine as the only agent for pediatric mri , it is not unusual to observe heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 
average discharge time among 165 children with bradycardia was longer and statistically significant compared to the other 372 children in the study population without bradycardia ( 99.08  32.57  min versus 89.74  25.54  min , p = 0.0012 , student 's t - test ) .
382 ( 70.2% ) of the total patients received one - time bolus , while two boluses were given to 162 patients ( 29.8% ) . in the population of 544 patients , additional medications ( fentanyl or midazolam )
the purpose of this retrospective study is to present our institutional experience with dexmedetomidine in relation to efficacy and related side effects .
