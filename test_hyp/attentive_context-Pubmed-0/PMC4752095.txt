after the follow - up period , 16 of the 21 patients ( 76.2% ) were dry ( 11 patients , 0 pads ; 5 patients using safety pads ) , 3 patients ( 14% ) had mild degree ppi and 2 patients ( 9.8% ) had moderate degree ppi . in the last assessment of the patients , qmax and estimated pvr were found to be 15.64.7 ( 10 - 31 ) ml / s and 10 ml , respectively .
the mean age of the patients was 66.27.3 ( 50 - 79 ) years and the mean pad usage was 6.40.6 ( 6 - 8 ) per day .
the present study reports our intermediate experience in men who underwent implantation of adjustable perineal male sling using a tissue expander for ppi .
although complications occurred in this study , including the removal of the device and the removal of inflation component due to local scrotal infection , our intermediate follow - up study suggests that an adjustable perineal male sling using a tissue expander appears to be an efficient and safe alternative surgical treatment option for patients suffering from ppi .
a total of 21 men with ppi underwent implantation of adjustable perineal male sling using a tissue expander .
