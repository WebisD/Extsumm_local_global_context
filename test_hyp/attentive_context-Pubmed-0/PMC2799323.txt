measurements of heart rate and body weight at the start and end of the working day showed that workers experienced increases in heart rate and loss of body weight as they worked in these hot conditions .
this showed that 13 workers who had the highest production output ( range 68 tons , average 7.45 tons ) were those who drank more than 6 l of liquid ( regular tap water and/or specially formulated rehydration solutions ) in comparison to those who drank less liquid and had a smaller production output .
the rehydration strategies were re - structured by decision makers participating in the project and the author of this paper .
monitored climate indices ( temperature and relative humidity ) values varied from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 8 am . according to the nicaraguan institute of territorial studies ( ineter ) ( 13 ) , relative humidity values for the whole month of april varied between 69 and 79% all along nicaragua 's pacific coastline from san juan del sur ( southern region ) to chinandega ( western region ) .
since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) .
