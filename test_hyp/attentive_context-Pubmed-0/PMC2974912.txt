therefore , our results for tight junction proteins may explain why , at 65  days of age , the intestinal barrier function of dp - bb rats on the standard diet is reduced compared with that of dr - bb rats .
the mrna expression levels of myo9b , ocln and cldn2 showed no significant changes over time , but myo9b and cldn2 mrna expression levels were increased as compared with dr - bb rats . in dr - bb and dp - bb rats of 34 and 41  days of age ,
fed the standard diet and in dp - bb rats on a hc diet , the animals that did not develop diabetes had no higher ileal cldn1 and tgf -  expression than the diabetic rats .
here we provide evidence that a hc diet restores the impaired intestinal barrier function in prediabetic dp - bb rats as reflected by increased ileal teer , reduced serum zonulin levels and a reduced urinary lactulose : mannitol ratio .
therefore , the comparable mrna expression levels of cldn1 and tgf -  in diabetic and non - diabetic rats might have been due to ageing .
the results presented here show that in dp - bb rats the level of prediabetic gut permeability is associated with autoimmune diabetes development later in life and that improvement of this intestinal barrier function might contribute to the prevention of autoimmune diabetes by dietary intervention with the hc diet .
