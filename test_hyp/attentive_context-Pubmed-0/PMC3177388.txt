in the united states , emineralised bone matrix ( dbm ) is considered a transplantable tissue and therefore , is regulated primarily by the american association of tissue banks.10 treatment of dehiscence and fenestration lesions with gbr technique and placing of implants simultaneously have predictable results.11 recent clinical studies have proven that the use of bone substitute materials together with placing implants led to successful coverage of pre - exposed implant surfaces.12
comparison of average bic of lamellar bone , woven bone , cenobone and dembone groups defects and control group ( lamellar bone p = 0.298 and woven bone p = 0.380 ) . furthermore , there was not meaningful difference in rate of lamellar bone ( p=0.298 ) and woven bone ( p = 0.380 ) formation in defects among the three groups .
average isq in cenobone group , dembone group and control group were 70.29%  7.74 ( max 82.25% and min 61.5% ) , 72.25%  6.81 ( max 82.5% and min 65.25% ) and 69.08%  2.67 ( max 72% and min 66.75% ) , respectively .
caplanis and colleagues placed , implants in the alveolar defects which treated with membrane on its own and membrane plus dfdba in dogs , the average bic was about 70%13 which is consistent to our study . and also , the bic obtained in this study is consistent with the findings of von arx and colleagues study14 that placed implants in areas grafted with dfdba and other hybrid materials in dogs and gained a high percentage of bic ( 59% to 75% ) . in this study , adding dfdba to the collagen membrane did not lead to strengthen induction of bone formation , and these findings were consistent with the results of other studies that showed adding dfdba to the membrane on its own did not significantly increase the clinical results obtained with the gbr procedure.151920 there were significant differences between the products of bone banks in terms of induction of bone formation .
