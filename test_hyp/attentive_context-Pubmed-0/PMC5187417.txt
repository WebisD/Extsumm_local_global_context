the algorithm decreased the computation by computing the objective energy of non - leaf nodes .
the parallel experiments proved that the fast tree search algorithm yielded an exponential speed - up in models of size 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 . in this paper , we have presented the two - dimensional triangular lattice model to study the designability of protein folding . through enumerating all the possible compact structures and hp sequences , we found that different compact structures have rather different designability .
the research offers strong evidence that compact structures of high designability are more regular and geometrically symmetric . in the opinion of structure ,
in the opinion of algorithm , we created the cluster tree by using the relationship between structure strings .
previous papers researched the problem of protein folding on the cubic lattice model whose goal was to find the fold with the maximum number of contacts between non - covalently linked hydrophobic amino acids . yet , a significant drawback of the cubic lattice is the  parity problem  . in this paper , we present a triangular lattice model that overcomes the shortcomings of the cubic lattice model .
