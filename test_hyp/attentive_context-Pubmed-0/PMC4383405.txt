we would focus on ocn , especially on its function as a hormone in metabolism homeostasis .
recent reports indicate that sost , a wnt antagonist , downregulates the wnt signaling activity by crosstalk with parathyroid hormone ( pth ) and bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) in order to regulate bone cell differentiation , proliferation , bone formation , and bone resorption activities   . even though there are plenty of evidences indicating that bone can secrete protein factors in the circulation and regulate itself ,
all these secreted factors can not be called hormones . however , in the past decades with the development of technology we found that skeleton can also be an endocrine organ , which regulates not only itself but also other organs . the most well known and studied two hormones secreted by skeleton are ocn and fibroblast growth factor 23 ( fgf23 )   ( figure 1 ) . in this review
classical understanding of skeleton is that bone functions as the structure scaffold in animals and contains three types of cells : osteoblast , osteocyte , and osteoclast .
studies in animal models showed that ucocn targets  cells in the pancreas to directly regulate insulin synthesis and regulates insulin sensitivity through adiponectin .
