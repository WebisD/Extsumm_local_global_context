, we aimed ( i ) to increase the understanding of the physiopathological response after prk in a long term postoperative period ; ( ii ) to identify molecular mediators involved in the wound healing process after prk ; and ( iii ) to assess a methodological approach for the identification of molecular mediators that could act as laboratory biomarkers for prognostic and monitoring purposes in the context of ocular surface diseases .
moreover , we report for the first time the pattern of expression / modulation of a wide panel of cytokines / chemokines in the conjunctival sac fluid of patients before and after prk treatment . as observed in a previous study focused on the analysis of a single cytokine ( trail ) , involved in migration   and inflammatory   processes
therefore , the objective of this study was to monitor the local cytokines / chemokines levels in patients undergoing prk including a wide inflammatory / immune mediators ' profile . by this experimental approach
the comparative analysis of the concentrations of the same cytokines / chemokines between serum samples and tears shows a more complex pattern of expression and higher levels of cytokines / chemokines in the microenvironment of the anterior surface of the eye , with respect to the systemic circulation .
