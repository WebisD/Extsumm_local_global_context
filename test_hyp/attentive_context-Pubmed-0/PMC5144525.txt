comparing survivors and nonsurvivors regarding trauma scores figure 4 compares roc curve for validity of the three studied trauma scores ( big , pts , and niss ) in prediction of mortality , big score 12.7 has sensitivity 86.7% , specificity 71.4% , positive predictive value ( ppv ) 56.5% , negative predictive value ( npv ) 92.6% , and confidence index ( ci ) 0.770.97 , whereas pts at value 3.5 has sensitivity 63.3% , specificity 68.6% , ppv 42.2% , npv 77.4% , and ci 0.570.85 and niss at value 39.5 has sensitivity 53.3% , specificity 54.3% , ppv 33.3% , npv 73.1% , and ci 0.480.79 . hence , the highest sensitivity and specificity of the three studied scores was to big score at cutoff value of 12.7 , while the lowest sensitivity and specificity was to niss at cutoff value niss 39.5 , while pts showing moderate specificity and sensitivity at cutoff value 3.5 .
we recommend that leaflets for big score be formed and calculated easily in the emergency department to help predicting mortality and decision - making regarding polytraumatized pediatric patients .
figure 4 shows also that areas under the roc curve of niss , pts , and big were 0.87 , 0.71 , and 0.63 respectively .
