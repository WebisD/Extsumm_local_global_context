functional dyspepsia ( fd ) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by the presence of recurrent or persistent symptoms thought to originate in the gastroduodenal region without any organic , systemic or metabolic disease that is likely to explain the symptoms.1 the pathophysiology of fd is considered to be multifactorial and not completely understood .
abnormal motor and sensory responses to duodenal acid or lipids have been demonstrated in patients with fd.7 - 11 duodenal eosinophilia has been reported in fd patients.12 focal t - cell aggregates , decreased cd4 + cells and increased macrophage counts have been observed in the duodenum of patients with presumed post - infectious fd ( pi - fd ) , which indicates impaired ability of the immune system to terminate the inflammatory response after acute insult.13 these studies suggest the possibility that the duodenum is involved in the pathophysiology of fd .
several mechanisms have been proposed to be of importance , such as delayed gastric emptying , impaired proximal gastric accommodation to a meal , gastric hypersensitivity to distension , abnormal duodenojejunal motility , and psychological disturbance.2 - 6 the stomach is traditionally believed to be mainly responsible for the genesis of dyspeptic symptoms .
