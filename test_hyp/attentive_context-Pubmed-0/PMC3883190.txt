we present a case of treatment of a fracture at the base of the acromion using a 90/90 plating construct that healed in a good position .
reverse shoulder prosthesis is an excellent surgical option for patients with certain shoulder pathologies , of which rotator cuff arthropathy is one .
a 71-year - old right - handed woman presented with a 2-year history of right shoulder pain and dysfunction , which began abruptly when lifting a heavy load . at the initial evaluation ,
recent studies are showing that not all acromial pathology is a contraindication to reverse shoulder arthroplasty ; in both pre- and post - operative patients , small lateral fractures of the acromion can be treated non - operatively or fixed surgically with a tension band technique .
however , fractures at the base of the acromion or of the scapular spine present a different problem . in these types of fractures , a larger length of deltoid muscle is detached , and therefore defunctioned . in reverse shoulder arthroplasty , in order to achieve a stable shoulder , the deltoid must be tensioned a great deal .
coronal ( a ) and axial ( b ) representations of the proposed classification scheme for acromial fractures associated with revere arthroplasty we propose the above mentioned classification system as it provides a nomenclature for acromial fractures that is descriptive and is based on the anatomy and functionality of the scapula . as the results from the review of the literature indicate , the more medial the fracture , the worse the prognosis with non - operative treatment .
