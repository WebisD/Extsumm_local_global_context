complications , though rare , are potentially fatal . to conclude , we herein report a unique case of anterior dislocation of fractured mandibular condyle leading to pseudo - ankylosis in a 8 yr old child . in this case report
this case report also suggests that unusual dislocations of mandibular condyle do occur in children , which require careful planning and treatment .
tm joint ankylosis may be very recent or old but of vital importance to any kind is an accurate diagnosis for successful management outcomes .
any pathology that afflicts the tm joint and restricts the mouth opening carries a mental stigma that overweighs the physical disability posed by the problem in growing children   in reviewing the types and patterns of disruption in tm joint function , we describe a distinct case of pseudo - ankylosis of a low condylar fracture , anteriorly displaced , dislocated , and fused to the zygomatic arch , in an 8-year - old child that sustained an old trauma ; the probable mechanism of injury that lead to this unique presentation is also proposed .
it is equally important to recapitulate the types and patterns of disruption in tm joint function when setting out to  open these cases as most cases usually get away without
