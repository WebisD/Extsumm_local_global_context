with the limitation of an observational study , in our experience a short - term ketogenic diet managed in the setting of general practice seemed to be able to improve a large number of anthropometric , haemodynamic and metabolic parameters related to the cardiovascular disease risk , with improvements maintained also on the long - term   .
this scientific question is of primary relevance , given the large prevalence of obesity in general population , that could not be managed in a hospital setting . in this context , the aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a ketogenic diet suggested and monitored in the setting of general practice , in term of long and mid - term weight loss and modification of the main cardiovascular ( cv ) disease risk factors .
in particular we examined a significant improvement in body weight , bmi , wc , ico , estimated body fat , sbp , dbp , pp , fpg , hba1c , ldl - c , tg and hdl - c levels , that tend to remain stable after 1  year from the end of the short ketogenic period .
the short - term body weight loss was quicker in men than in women ( p  <  0.05 ) , greater in those subjects experiencing a ketonuria in the first period of diet ( p  <  0.001 ) , and was directly related to the baseline body weight ( rr 1.10 , 95  % ci 1.041.16 , p  <  0.001 ) , and inversely to patient age ( rr 0.20 , 95  % ci 0.27 to 0.15 , p  <  0.001 ) , while the long term body weight loss was greater in those subjects experiencing a ketonuria in the first period of diet ( p  <  0.05 ) , and was directly related to the baseline body weight ( rr 1.26 , 95  % ci 1.271.18 , p  <  0.001 ) and body fat mass ( rr 1.17 , 95  % ci 1.011.33 , p  =  0.033 ) .
