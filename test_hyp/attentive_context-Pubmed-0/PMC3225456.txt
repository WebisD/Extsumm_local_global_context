orbital apex syndrome is a condition in which the oculomotor nerve , trochlear nerve , abducens nerve , and ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve are damaged .
orbital apex syndrome can be caused by a variety of inflammatory , infectious , neoplastic , iatrogenic/ traumatic , and vascular conditions.1 we present our findings in a patient with orbital apex syndrome associated with herpes zoster ophthalmicus .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed inflammatory changes that extended to the cavernous sinus and orbital apex .
an 81-year - old woman attended a neighborhood hospital because of nausea and loss of appetite of 10 days duration .
treatment with intravenous prednisolone 60 mg followed by tapering and vidarabine antiviral therapy markedly improved the extraocular palsies and optic nerve dysfunction . these changes
therefore , ophthalmologists should be careful not to miss the neurological complications , and be especially vigilant during the 14 days after onset of herpes zoster ophthalmicus .
herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a relatively common disease in clinical ophthalmological practice , but is rarely accompanied by neurological complications .
stay , there was a reduction of the corneal reflex , and herpes keratoconjunctivitis was diagnosed .
herpes zoster ophthalmicus can be triggered by reactivation of varicella zoster virus that is dormant in the trigeminal nerve ganglia .
