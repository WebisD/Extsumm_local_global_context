morphin identifies human diseases most relevant to model organism pathway genes using highly sensitive and statistically robust methods incorporating a human gene network . for each significant human disease association
, morphin also prioritizes the query genes for disease relevance and visualizes the gene network comprised of query and disease genes .
most human disease pathways are evolutionarily conserved with other organisms . for example , the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans , which is relatively distant in phylogeny from humans , is used as a model system to study human parkinson 's disease ( 1 ) . despite limited functional mimicry of some human diseases ( 2 ) and recent advances in patient - based disease genetics due to genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) and disease genome sequencing , non - human model organisms remain indispensable in human disease research , because ( i ) disease - associated dna variants typically explain only a small proportion of disease heritability ; ( ii ) detailed molecular mechanisms of disease processes often can not be studied directly in humans for ethical reasons ( 3 ) . while model organisms will remain critical for human disease research into the future , the functional relevance of pathways conserved between humans and other species can sometimes be nonobvious ( 4 ) , hampering identification of new human disease models in other , more experimentally tractable organisms .
