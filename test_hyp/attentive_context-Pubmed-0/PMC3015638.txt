this study aimed to document the authors ' experience with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in children .
laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in children can be offered , as it is safe , reproducible , and technically easy for experienced laparoscopic surgeons .
patients were admitted in the evening 1 day before surgery and discharged within 24 hours following surgery .
two lateral ports of 3-mm were made through the right and left pararectal region to maintain a triangular orientation . in cases with small defects , laparoscopic ring closure ( lrc )
laparoscopic surgery has been applied in children , and the repair is based on the same principle .
the median follow - up was 30 months ( range , 2 to 84 ) .
the essential step in the conventional method for inguinal hernia repair in children is simple ligation of the hernial sac without narrowing the open ring . from our point of view
first and the most obvious is the confirmation of the hernia and looking for the contralateral side .
the procedure was modified in 24% of children with a dilated internal ring ( figure 4 ) .
of the 29 bilateral hernias , 20 underwent lrc , 7 underwent liptr , and 2 underwent lrc on one side and liptr on the other side .
