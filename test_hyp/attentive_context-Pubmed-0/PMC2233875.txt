this review summarizes recent data of effects by nano- and 
 microstructured biomaterials and particles in vitro designed for 
 orthopaedic application to get a solid 
 framework outlining the critical interactions that govern the 
 cytocompatibility . 
 because biomaterials in orthopaedics are predominantly 
 applied on bone , this review is focussed on 
 the interactions of osteoblasts 
  and bone - marrow - derived 
 cells with structured biomaterials .
micro- and nanoparticles released by friction of 
 articulating partners from artificial joints are a major 
 reason for aseptic 
 implant loosening in orthopaedic surgery and may lead to severe 
 peri - implant 
 osteolysis ( particle disease ) 
 .
nanotechnology is also applied to modify and improve the surface 
 structure in orthopaedic implants to promote their 
 osseous integration . however , there are also side effects of nano- and 
 microparticles in vivo . 

especially , the 
 superordinate principles of cellular responses to 
 surfaces with a defined 
 topography are not well known and poorly understood . 
 because many variables 
 influence cellular interactions to surface structures , 
 it is difficult to draw 
 conclusions and formulate general principles for 
 nano- and microstructured 
 surfaces .
nanolayers are used to enhance the 
 surface biocompatibility of polymeric drug delivery systems , 
 control the release of substances such as antibiotics or growth factors 
 , act as gene - delivery 
 vehicles , or serve as robust light emitters for 
 cellular labeling and tracking 
 [ semiconductor nanocrystals , quantum dots ( qds ) ] 
 .
