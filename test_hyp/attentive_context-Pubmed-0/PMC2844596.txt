regards , we can conclude that the real value of rh in endometrial cancer patients with suspicious cervical involvement can be evaluated by performing a large scaled randomized controlled study comparing the survival and quality of life between the group who underwent rh only or followed by tailored adjuvant radiation and the group with eh and routine adjuvant radiation therapy .
we reviewed the medical records of endometrial cancer patients with cervical involvement to determine the relation of parametrial spread with other histopathological variables and to evaluate whether the type of primary surgery using eh or rh alters the patients ' outcome from a histological perspective .
the cancer database from five different institutes were reviewed ; patients surgically diagnosed with stage ii and a part of stage iii or iva endometrial cancer with cervical involvement during the period of 1993 - 2005 were identified .
eh was performed in 12/62 ( 19.4% ) patients who were preoperatively suspected of cervical involvement , and more than half ( 37/71 , 52.1% ) of the patients who underwent rh had no preoperative evidence of cervical invasion .
thus , although the only definitive method of ensuring the status and extent of disease in the parametria is through radical excision and a histological study of the operative specimen , the unreliability of preoperative prediction , and the relative rarity of pmi may make it unwise to resort to rh as a matter of routine in patients with cervical invasion ( 12 ) .
