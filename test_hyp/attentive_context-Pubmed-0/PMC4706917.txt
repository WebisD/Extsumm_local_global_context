systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that is characterized by involvement in multiple organs and the overproduction of autoantibodies .
this review focuses on the relationship between the inkt cell population and the development of sle , on how inkt cells are involved in the regulation of sle by shaping immune responses , and on potential applications of these cells in sle treatment .
are implicated , we reasonably think that inkt cells play an important role in immune response including autoimmune diseases .
although the precise pathogenesis of sle remains unclear , abnormal immune tolerance and overactivation or hyperproliferation of t and b lymphocytes are considered to be some of the main causes . that b cells can produce multiple autoantibodies against autoantigens with help from t cells that have been verified by a number of studies in vivo or in vitro . to avoid the development of autoimmune disease
although the regulatory effects of inkt cells have already been expounded in some diseases , these regulatory effects of these cells in sle have not been well summarized .
another primary mechanism of tolerance is the suppression of excessive immune response among conventional t cells , such as regulatory cd4+cd25 + t cells ( tregs ) .
