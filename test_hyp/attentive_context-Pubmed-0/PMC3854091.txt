the aim of our study was to investigate the association of plasma ptx3 levels with t2 dm and dn in this malay population .
the patients with dn had lower ptx3 levels compared to t2 dm without dn ( 1.63 versus 3.08  ng / ml ; p = 0.013 ) . in females , however , there was no statistically significant difference of the mean values of plasma ptx3 levels among ngt and t2 dm with and without dn ( 3.09 , 3.55 , and 2.11  ng / ml ; p = 0.262 , anova test ) ( figure 1(b ) ) .  
the present study provides the first evidence that decreased plasma ptx3 levels are associated with t2 dm and dn in malay men and also suggests that ptx3 may have different effects in dn and ckd .
our analyses indicated that plasma ptx3 levels in t2 dm patients with and without dn were lower as compared with ngt subjects in males ( 2.62 versus 3.98  ng / ml ; p = 0.021 ) but not in females ( 3.24 versus 3.09  ng / ml ; p = 0.748 ) .  
figure 1(a ) showed that plasma ptx3 levels were consistently decreased from ngt to t2 dm without dn and to the patients with dn in males ( 3.98 , 2.78 , and 1.63  ng / ml ; p = 0.008 anova test ) . among males ,
