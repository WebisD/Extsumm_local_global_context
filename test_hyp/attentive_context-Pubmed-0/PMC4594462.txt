our recent report of fructose , glucose , and sucrose content in cycad tissues sets the stage for designing continued research on how non - structural carbohydrates are involved in cycad pollination biology . moreover , cycad horticulturists routinely harvest , store , and ship pollen prior to its use for successful pollination .
finally , the risks associated with coextinctions are very real during this phase of the anthropocene , and species with complex life history traits , such as cycads , appear to be at greater risk for direct involvement in coextinctions . an increase in knowledge of how cycad carbohydrates influence successful pollination relationships may help reduce the risks of coextinctions in these mutualisms that support contemporary cycad biology .
this is an opportune time to add members of the cycadales to studies that have linked the relationship of pollen carbohydrates to insect versus wind pollination strategies .
the insect pollinators of cycads gather on male cones , where the adults socialize , mate , and use the post - dispersal male strobilus tissue as larvae food ( fig .
the role of starch and sugars in pollen development , dispersal , and maintenance of viability has not been determined for any member of the cycadales , and is therefore a focus of needed research .
