readmission included being male ( adjusted hazard ratio [ adjusted hr ]  =  1.087 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.0361.140 , p  =  0.001 ) , higher insurance premium level ( adjusted hr  =  1.107 , 95% ci , 1.0151.208 , p  =  0.022 ) , length of stay during first ipc admission ( adjusted hr  =  1.006 , 95% ci , 1.0051.008 , p  <  0.001 ) , being admitted to a teaching hospital ( adjusted hr  =  1.105 , 95% ci , 1.0031.218 , p  =  0.044 ) , and being admitted to a tertiary hospital ( adjusted hr  =  1.113 , 95% ci , 1.0061.232 , p  =  0.038 ) .
males , patients with a higher insurance premium level , patients with a longer length of stay during first ipc admission , admission to a teaching hospital , and admission to a tertiary hospital all increased the adjusted hr for readmission . the target population in this study included terminal cancer patients with limited life expectancy .
the results may help inform policy discussions to improve the relatively late referral rate to ipc and to reduce the high readmission rate among terminal cancer patients in taiwan .
