in conclusion novel identified p190 - 13 25-mer peptide is able to induce in vitro a peptide - specific cd4 + t cell response in ph+ all patients .
thus there appears a good candidate for developing an immune target vaccine strategy possibly synergizing with tkis for remission maintenance . a p190 - 13 peptide vaccine trial in ph+ all patients in complete hematologic remission during tkis is currently in planning .
previously , we have developed a p210-breakpoint derived penta - peptide vaccine for controlling minimal residual disease in chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) patients treated with imatinib . in this setting , we found that the best antileukemia immune response was mediated by cd4 + t cells specific for an hla class ii 
philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ph+ all ) is a high - risk , aggressive form of acute leukemia , affecting primarily adults and the elderly .
p210-breakpoint peptide - specific cd4 + t cells isolated from vaccinated patients were found to be either perforin+ or cd25+/foxp3 + : in both cases they exerted direct cytotoxic activity against a cml cell line . based on these premises , in our vaccine strategy for ph+ all , we focused our efforts in the search for p190 breakpoint peptides as strong inducers of a peptide - specific cd4 + t cell response .
