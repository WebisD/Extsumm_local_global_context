the study was conducted with the following aims : 
 to estimate and compare the levels of opn in plasma of subjects with healthy periodontium and generalized chronic periodontitis.to estimate opn levels in plasma of generalized chronic periodontitis subjects 2 months after scaling and root planing.to compare opn levels in plasma of generalized chronic periodontitis subjects before and after two months after scaling and root planing.to correlate opn with periodontal disease index before and two months after scaling and root planing .
