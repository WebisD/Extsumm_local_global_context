therefore , the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between ir and the atp iii criteria for mets and to evaluate the ability to detect ir from the method of insulin suppression test ( ist ) in subjects fulfilling those criteria .
the sensitivity to detect ir by using the criteria for mets was about 47% overall ; the sensitivity was slightly higher in men than in women ( 53% vs. 41% ) ( table 3 ) .
the positive predictive value was higher in men ( 70% ) than in women ( 60% ) , with an overall value of 64.8% .
in general , men had higher bps and bmis and lower hdl - c levels than the women .
meanwhile , in terms of the prevention of cvd , obesity and high tg levels might play an important role than other criteria in subjects with mets .
the commonest abnormality related to mets was a low hdl - c value , followed by high bp , and then the other components ( table 2 ) .
the most common combination in subjects with both mets and ir were obesity , high bp , and low hdl - c level .
