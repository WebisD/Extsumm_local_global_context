the factors identified to improve the duration of pfs in multivariate analysis were : number of metastatic sites ( p = .01 ) , metastatic sites ( p = .02 ) , disease free interval ( p = .001 ) , previous hormonal therapy ( p = .03 ) , response to first line chemotherapy ( p < .0001 ) and an administration of maintenance hormonal therapy ( p < .0001 ) . the factors related to an increase of os duration in multivariate analysis were : number of metastatic sites ( p = .01 ) , metastatic sites ( p = .04 ) , disease free interval ( p < .0001 ) , response to first line chemotherapy ( p = 0.0001 ) and an administration of maintenance hormonal therapy ( p = .001 ) . tables 2 and 3 list the significant predictive factors for the duration of pfs and os after first - line chemotherapy .
figures 1 and 2 show the patients ' pfs and os from the first line of chemotherapy according to maintenance hormonal status .
the present study was conducted to identify the factors which influence progression - free survival after the first line of chemotherapy . among them , the present study focuses on the impact of hormonal maintenance therapy and constitutes the largest retrospective study on this subject .
