rapid advances in the crystallographic 
 determination of transmembrane 
 ( tm ) protein structures , and especially of g - protein coupled receptors 
 ( gpcrs ) , have established the lipidic cubic phase ( lcp ) as a suitable 
 medium for growing high quality crystals of these proteins ( see ref ( 1,2 ) and citations therein ) .
thus , our findings provide novel energy - based 
 insights into driving elements of in meso crystallization 
 mechanisms and lay the foundation for future quantitative exploration 
 of rational approaches for the generation of structure - quality crystals 
 of membrane proteins .
we present the 
 results of a molecular dynamics - based study 
 of a gpcr reconstituted into an lcp environment that reveal differences 
 in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic exposure of the gpcr to lipid 
the main findings from this study offer 
 unprecedented insight into 
 molecular level processes related to in meso crystallization , 
 which are likely leading to protein nucleation and eventually to crystal 
 growth .
, we evaluated the protein - dependent membrane 
 deformations and their attendant energy cost , and identified specific 
 tm regions and residues of rhodopsin that exhibit differential hydrophobic 
 exposure in the lcp and lamellar bilayers .
