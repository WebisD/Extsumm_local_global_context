further investigation is required to determine the interplay of these vfs and concurrently identifying the mechanisms regulating the expression of these traits in sepsis and nonsepsis e.  coli isolates in order to improve the management of infectious diseases .
a knowledge of such virulence patterns and their correlation with phylogenetic groups is critical for our understanding of bacterial infection and is indispensable to the development of devising related novel therapeutic strategies .
in addition , an overall prevalence of vfs among all the phylogenetic groups was higher in the blood e.  coli isolates . however , the high prevalence of aer , trat and pai among faecal e.  coli isolates indicated that the host environment may have an important role to play for a differential expression of these virulence genes to induce pathogenicity in the hospital setting .
the high prevalence of all the vfs studied in the blood and faecal e.  coli isolates and a similar prevalence of aer , trat and pai indicate their role in the sustenance and development of infection .
, we report for the first time a correlation of phylogenetic groups with important virulence markers in blood and faecal e.  coli isolates from patients with and without sepsis admitted to the icu .
