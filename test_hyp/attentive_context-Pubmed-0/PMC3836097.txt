in this large community - based cohort study , we demonstrated the differential association between osa and impaired glucose metabolism according to the presence of obesity . of note
therefore , a significant interaction between osa and obesity was observed for homa- ( p = 0.025 ) . after excluding subjects who were taking medication for diabetes or dyslipidemia , in the nonobese group , fpg and 2hpg
the only previous study to analyze the effect of osa according to obesity status was the sleep heart health study , where the association between osa and abnormal glucose metabolism was not different between the nonoverweight and overweight / obese groups ( 3 ) .
about 36.6% of nonobese and 58.2% of obese subjects had osa . however , the severity of osa was mostly mild and moderate ( 27 , 8.8 , and 0.8% of nonobese and 38.4 , 14.6 , and 5.2% obese subjects had mild , moderate , and severe osa , respectively ) . among 396 subjects with diabetes , 351 had a history of diabetes of whom 142 were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents ( n = 140 ) or insulin ( n = 4 ) .
