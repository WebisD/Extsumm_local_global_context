it will be a true representation of distribution and prevalence of atherosclerotic lesions present in the population if an autopsy study is conducted on deceased patients without any prior history of coronary artery disease and who expired due to noncardiac causes ( as compared to the deaths caused by cardiac causes ) . with this hypothesis we conducted this study in 113 noncardiac death patients .
frequency and severity / degree of atherosclerosis in different coronary vessels before and after 3 decade of life amongst the 83 cases , all the three coronary arteries were severely involved ( triple vessel disease ) in 18 cases ( 22% ) .
the average heart weight of 83 subjects found to have evidence of atherosclerosis in males and females was found to be 287.21 and 246 g , respectively .
correlation of age with number of coronary vessels involved evidence of acute mi was found in nine ( 10.8% ) cases , old healed scars were found in 11 ( 13.25% ) cases , and evidence of congestion was found in 36 ( 43.37% ) cases [ table 5 ] .
degree / severity of atherosclerosis in the coronary vessels the 3 decade of life appears to be a watershed line in the pathogenesis of coronary vascular atherosclerosis , as we observed a steady increase in overall frequency , the number of coronary vessels involved , and severity of atherosclerosis from the 3 decade onwards [ table 3 ] .
