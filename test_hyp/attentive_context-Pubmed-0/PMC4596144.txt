while there is a large body of evidence in favor of a clustering of representations of body effectors in the posterior parietal cortex , recent advances have revealed a hierarchical organization beyond a flat intentional map composed of functionally distinct subdivisions operating in parallel at same level . in particular , the parietal reach region ( prr ) and dorsal area 5 ( area 5d ) have been found to play distinct roles in visually - guided reach .
based on three lines of neurophysiological studies on nonhuman primates that utilize sophisticated behavioral tasks , including reference frame , effector choice , and sequential reach , this essay proposes that the prr and area 5d are involved in translation of general motor intentions into detailed motor programs at different stages .
also , there are many issues regarding what you mean by sensory - motor hierarchy , sensory - to - motor transformation , and integrated circuits for decision making , planning , and the link with frontal cortex . in the absence of a clear lay - out of these terms
but , there are so many examples of hierarchy and sensory - to - motor transformation and their roles in planning , and decision making , etc
