between january 2004 and december 2010 , we followed 3,920 operated patients of total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) and identified 23 patients with periprosthetic supracondylar fractures .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of periprosthetic supracondylar femoral fractures following tka using nonoperative as well as open reduction and internal fixation ( orif ) techniques .
as per radiological assessment , two of three conservatively treated cases had malunion , whereas among 20 cases treated operatively , 16 had primary union with one malunion .
two patients had union after bone grafting , whereas two had nonunion . the average reduction in the knee score after fracture was 20.53% .
of the 23 patients , 20 patients were treated by operative method , whereas only three patients with relatively undisplaced fractures were treated nonoperatively .
there were 17 women and 6 men and the average age was 68.26 years ( range 52 - 83 years ) .
periprosthetic supracondylar femoral fractures following total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) are infrequent , but is a devastating complication .
to conclude , we found that the total incidence of periprosthetic fractures in operated tka was 0.58% ( 23 of 3,920 ) ; 87% patients ( 20 of 23 ) fell in the r2 category of rorabeck 's classification .
