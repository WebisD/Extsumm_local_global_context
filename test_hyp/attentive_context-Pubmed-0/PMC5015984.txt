, we demonstrate the potential of de-117 pcl devices based on in vitro release kinetics of de-117 , biocompatibility of device in the intracameral space , and distribution of de-117 and hde-117 in ocular tissues upon implantation .
previous studies have shown that the degradation rate of physical blends of pla and pcl is between those of pure pla and pcl . in summary
preimplantation in vitro release studies of these devices yielded a linear release rate of 0.435  0.075 g / day ( r = 0.989 to linear fit ) .
, this calculation suggests that the experimental conditions used in the in vitro release study resembled physiological conditions in the anterior chamber of the eye and in vitro release results can be used to estimate release in vivo . 
 
to design our pcl ocular implant , design parameters were based on a predictive model of drug release .
these include an implant device for delivery of latanoprost ( durasert ; pfizer , new york , ny , usa ) and a sustained release formulation of bimatoprost currently in phase 3 clinical trials ( nct02250651 ; allergan , irvine , ca , usa ) . we explored biodegradable polymers and formulations that can achieve a release of de-117 of 6 months or more in the anterior chamber and chose pcl as our device material . compared with other polymers that have been utilized in glaucoma drug delivery devices such as poly(lactic - co - glycolic acid ) , we noted that a slow degradation rate of pcl is important to achieve zero - order release of the therapeutic over several months . since the device acts as a diffusion - limiting barrier in our design , a hypothetical polymer that degrades completely in 6 months would not be able to deliver the therapeutic at a constant rate for 6 months .
