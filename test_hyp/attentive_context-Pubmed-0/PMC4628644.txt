we demonstrate that crt - p patients , as chosen in routine clinical practice , were older , more likely to be female , with less ischaemic heart disease , more advanced hf , and greater co - morbidity burden compared with crt - d patients .
after considering potential confounding factors in a cox proportional hazards regression analysis , crt - p remained associated with increased mortality [ hazard ratio ( hr ) 1.54 , 95% ci 1.072.21 , p = 0.0209 ] , as well as the presence of co - morbidities ( hr 1.98 , 95% ci 1.342.92 , p = 0.0006 ) and functional nyha class iv ( hr 1.85 , 95% ci 1.103.11 , p = 0.0207 ) . using the propensity - matched cohort , crt - p was associated with increased mortality ( rr 2.0 , 95% ci 1.223.28 , p = 0.01 ) .
patients with crt - p compared with crt - d were older ( 75.9 vs. 65.6 years , p < 0.0001 ) , less often male ( 69.5 vs. 80.8% , p < 0.0001 ) , more symptomatic ( proportion of nyha class iii / iv , 87.9 vs. 80.8% , p = 0.0005 ) , with less coronary artery disease ( 40.7 vs. 49.3% , p = 0.003 ) , wider qrs ( 160.8 vs. 154.9 ms , p = 0.002 ) , more af ( 38.7 vs. 22.1% , p < 0.0001 ) , and more co - morbidities ( 2 comorbidities , 16.9 vs. 12.9% , p = 0.04 ; table  1 ) .
