d2 was utilized as a deuterium source to enable the 
 isolation and characterization of the low - coordinate iron deuteride 
 complexes [ lfe(-d)]2 and [ lfe(-d)]2 .
unfortunately , the aforementioned inability to observe resonances 
 for h and d bound to a metal has so far prevented the monitoring of 
 h / d exchange in paramagnetic hydride complexes . in this article , 
 we describe synthetic and characterization advances 
 for two high - spin iron(ii)-hydride complexes , supported by the -diketiminate 
 ligands l and l ( chart 1 ) . in an interesting twist , these studies benefit 
 from unusually large ( up to 5.7 ppm ) isotope effects on the h nmr chemical shifts of the distant protons upon hydride deuteration , 
 a phenomenon that occurs only in the dimeric hydride 
 complexes in our system .
in addition , this is the only way to distinguish 
 hydride from deuteride isotopologues , and this discovery enables us 
 to monitor h / d exchange in this system for the first time .
piecs also enabled the correct h nmr assignments of 
 the hydride complexes , as well as the study of intermolecular hydride 
 exchange .
more generally , these studies show that h nmr spectroscopy 
 can be a powerful tool for the study of paramagnetic iron hydride 
 complexes : not despite the paramagnetism , but because of the paramagnetism through the piecs effect .
