reconstruction after wide excision of mcc offers several unique challenges including a propensity for elderly patients with poor tissue quality and decreased immune function , large defects and a high probability of disease recurrence , and the risks inherent to adjuvant radiotherapy . for this reason
oncologic surgery within the head and neck presents unique problems , especially when treating merkel cell carcinoma . because of the rarity of mcc , there is limited clinical data to guide management .
there is clearly a need for higher quality of data in the area , as significant questions remain for the treatment for merkel cell cancer , as well as the reconstructive methods utilized after ablative surgery .
, most reconstructive surgeons favor free tissue transfer as a modality for providing healthy , uninvolved tissue with an acceptable aesthetic outcome .
current free tissue transfer techniques allow the reconstructive surgeon to manage advanced mcc with acceptable functional and aesthetic results , while minimizing morbidity .
this is a crucial question for the reconstructive surgeon as it may impact defect size and the probability of local recurrence .
novel targeted therapies are currently being developed and will be discussed elsewhere in this special issue on mcc .
