recent studies showed that crp is a strong predictor of future coronary artery disease in healthy men and women the purpose of the present study is to quantitatively evaluate the serum levels of crp in both male and female subjects with various degrees of periodontitis ( chronic and aggressive form ) and compare them with controls who have a clinically healthy periodontium .
comparison of c - reactive protein levels among all the groups the results of the present study indicated an increase in serum crp levels in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis compared with controls .
was found in the crp level between groups i and ii and between groups ii and iii and between groups i and iii [ table 1 ] .
clinical parameters , such as bleeding on probing , showed a positive correlation with crp levels in aggressive periodontitis group and a positive correlation was also seen for probing pd , clinical attachment level , and crp in chronic periodontitis group of subjects .
slightly elevated ( > 0.33 mg / l ) and chronically present levels of crp were determined to have a predictive value for the occurrence of a cardiovascular event .
