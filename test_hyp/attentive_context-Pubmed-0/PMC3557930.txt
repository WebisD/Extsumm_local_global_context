, we assume that 
 the rearrangements of 6 and 13a , c follow a retentive and invertive course , respectively , in analogy 
 to chiral , nonracemic organolithiums with the same heteroatom , but 
 an alkyl group instead of the deuterium atom .
four chiral thio[d1]methyllithiums 
 with different substituents 
 at sulfur were prepared by tin  lithium exchange and their microscopic 
 configurational stability was determined relative to the thiophosphate--mercaptophosphonate 
 and thia -- wittig rearrangements , respectively ( figure 3 ) .
lithium 
 exchange ( salt free ? ) proved to be chemically very labile but microscopically 
 configurationally stable on the time scale of the addition to benzaldehyde 
 and acetophenone at 78 c . in summary
while 13a is configurationally stable at 95 c , 13b underwent the thia -- rearrangement only down to 50 c 
 and racemized completely . in case of 13b , the microscopic 
 configurational stability was also evaluated on the time scale of 
 its addition to benzaldehyde .
analogously , thiomethyllithium 13b and bromomethyllithium 26 add to benzaldehyde 
 with retention of configuration .
. microscopic 
 configurational stability of various thio[d1]methyllithiums 
 on the time scale of rearrangements for 6 and 13a  c and on the time scale 
 of addition of 13b and bromo[d1]methyllithiums 26 to benzaldehyde .
