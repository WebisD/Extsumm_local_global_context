the aim of this study was to compare the power output , fatigue and activation properties of proximally versus distally placed sdss electrodes in an isokinetic knee extension task simulating knee movement during recumbent cycling .
overall , especially in the final phase of stimulation , the distal sdss setup showed higher power outputs ( the only exception was pmean , s in the initial phase , which was minimally lower for distal sdss ) .
the development of new array electrodes , specifically for sdss , where the initial pulse is applied directly on the motor point and the following pulses are randomly distributed , may combine the positive effects of the proximal and distal electrode placements .
