. however , statin use ( hr , 0.47 ; 95% ci , 0.22 - 1.02 ; p=0.056 ) was not an independent prognostic factor for rfs ( hr , 0.47 ; 95% ci , 0.22 - 1.02 ; p=0.056 ) and css ( hr , 0.46 ; 95% ci , 0.18 - 1.14 ; p=0.093 ) . in the multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for os ( data not shown ) , age ( hr , 1.05 ; 95% ci , 1.02 - 1.07 ; p<0.001 ) , tumor grade ( hr , 1.97 ; 95% ci , 1.21 - 3.23 ; p=0.008 ) , tumor stage ( hr , 2.03 ; 95% ci , 1.20 - 3.42 ; p=0.001 ) , surgical margin ( hr , 2.12 ; 95% ci , 1.16 - 3.86 ; p=0.014 ) , and lymph node status ( hr , 2.39 ; 95% ci , 1.34 - 4.26 ; p=0.003 ) were independent prognostic factors for os in patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy for utuc .
multivariate analysis revealed that the only statistically significant predictors of rfs and css were tumor grade , tumor stage , and adjuvant therapy . however , statin use ( hr , 0.47 ; 95% ci , 0.22 - 1.02 ; p=0.056 ) was not an independent prognostic factor for rfs ( hr , 0.47 ; 95% ci , 0.22 - 1.02 ; p=0.056 ) and css ( hr , 0.46 ; 95% ci , 0.18 - 1.14 ; p=0.093 ) . in the multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for os (
