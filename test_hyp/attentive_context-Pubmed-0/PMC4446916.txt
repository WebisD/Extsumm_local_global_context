on the basis of these considerations , we performed a study to test the hypothesis that clopidogrel as an irreversible antiplatelet and oral prostacycline analog as an arterial vasodilator and additional antiaggregant drug may increase venous distensibility and arterial elasticity and would prevent primary avf failure in hemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus .
the mean maturation time of avf was 38  6.5 day and 53  12.8 day in clopidogrel plus oral prostacycline analog and placebo groups , respectively ( p = 0.023 ) .
clopidogrel and oral prostacycline analog , which begins 710 days prior to avf creation and continuing during follow - up period seems to be effective and safe , and inhibit primary avf failure with acceptable side effects in hemodialysis patients .
the mean ages were 54.23  2.6 and 55.8  2.8 years in group 1 and 2 respectively ( p > 0.05 ) .
four weeks after the surgery , avf maturation failure developed in 14 patients ( 30.4% ) in placebo group and in 4 patients ( 8% ) in clopidogrel and oral prostacycline analog group ( p = 0.001 ) . fistula maturation and survival has been confirmed using physical examinations and by a doppler usg every month for each patient .
