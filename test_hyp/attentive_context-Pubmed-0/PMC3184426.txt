finally , we monitored the exercise - induced effects on morning corticosterone and leptin levels in plasma as well as the weight of abdominal fat mass .
here , we report a 3-fold increase in bdnf gene - expression levels in the ls following three weeks of voluntary running ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ) . to our knowledge , this is the first demonstration that bdnf mrna levels in the female ls are markedly increased following long - term exercise .
, we have studied crfr2 and bdnf in the female mouse ls using quantitative real - time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qrt - pcr ) in an exercise paradigm .
the lateral septum ( ls ) , a brain area important in the shaping of coping responses to stress and found to modulate the activity in the amygdala , exhibits the highest density of crf2 in the brain .   here
in addition , we studied the effect after voluntary exercise on crfr2 , since the ls harbors substantial levels of crfr2   and since this receptor has been reported to mediate coping responses during the recovery phase after stress   . in the present study ,
