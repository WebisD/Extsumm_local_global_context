in this report , we present two cases of cardiac masses documented by percutaneous transvenous biopsy under the guidance of an ice .
a 51-year - old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 3-day history of progressive dyspnea and generalized edema .
it can be used for the biopsy of the mass from right - side of the heart , especially in patients with high risk for anesthesia.9,10,11 ) these ice - guided techniques allow the physician to safely and effectively perform endocardial biopsy with short total procedure time and less exposure to radiation .
although it needs local anesthesia and venous puncture with relatively large catheter , it can give us a good guidance during the biopsy of cardiac tumors .
the histologic confirmation is necessary for the definite diagnosis and is essential in determining the treatment for patients with cardiac tumors .
percutaneous transvenous biopsy of cardiac tumor can be done under the guidance of transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) .
, we showed the feasibility of the ice during targeting of the biopsy catheter , without a requirement of patient sedation .
the use of ice during the procedures increase diagnostic yield and can reduce the incidence of cardiac complications associated with inadequate targeting of the biopsy catheters .
