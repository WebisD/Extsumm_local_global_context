the aim of this study was to analyze various clinico - pathological and radiological features in the benign fol reported and to compare the features between fibrous dysplasia ( fd ) and cemento - ossifying fibroma ( cof ) .
fibro - osseous lesions ( fol ) are a poorly defined group of lesions affecting the jaws and craniofacial bones .
these patients were treated for fol , reported to the hospital between 1989 and 2009 .
so proper categorization requires good correlation of the history , clinical findings , radiographic characteristics , operative findings , and histologic appearance .
both cof and fd showed multiple recurrences . since few of our cof cases showed history of trauma and association with osteosarcoma , a careful detailing of these in the history
is emphasized although its correlation with the occurrence of the lesion can not be established through this study . as aggressive behavior and recurrence
the sex distribution of 80 patients with fibro - osseous lesions most of the time , fol patients complained of a slow - growing swelling of the jaws and facial asymmetry ( 75 patients = 93.7% ) whereas in four patients ( 5% ) , it was an incidental finding ; all these four cases were later diagnosed to be cof . in one case of fd ,
