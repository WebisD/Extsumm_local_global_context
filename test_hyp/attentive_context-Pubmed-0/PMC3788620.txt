to point out the shortcomings associated 
 with the interpretation 
 of membrane protein structure and function in experimental environments , 
 we provide here , to our knowledge for the first time , a detailed molecular 
 view of the leut protein embedded in ddm detergent micelles formed 
 at different detergent / water / protein ratios .
moreover , the md simulations of the system at various 
 p / d ratios suggest a mechanism for the dependence of leut substrate 
 binding stoichiometry on detergent concentration .
this view is offered 
 from extensive atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations carried 
 out in order to ( 1 ) establish the aggregation number of ddm micelles 
 surrounding leut , ( 2 ) explore the overall organization of the detergent 
 micelle containing the transporter , and ( 3 ) obtain molecular - level 
 insight into the nature and consequences of interactions between leut 
 and ddm . analyzing various protein - to - detergent ( p / d ) number ratios 
 ( i.e. , from 1:160 to 1:300 ) , we show that the aggregation number of 
 ddm in the micelle that surrounds the transporter is strongly dependent 
 on the p / d ratio .
furthermore , the results presented here illustrate , on the molecular 
 level , how even small variations in protein preparation with detergent 
 can lead to the differential behavior of the proteomicelle and to 
 differences in processes such as the penetration of detergent into 
 the transporter .
