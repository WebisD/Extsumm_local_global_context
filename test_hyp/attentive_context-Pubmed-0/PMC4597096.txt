the aim of this study was to establish the possible effect of gc treatment on upper limb function by using the pul in a cohort of non - ambulant dmd boys and adults .
the effect of gc was more obvious in the patients between 12 and 18 years and at shoulder and elbow levels .
the mean changes were 3.79 in the gc group , 5.52 in those who stopped gc at loss of ambulation and 4.44 in the gc nave group .
the percentage decrease in the middle pul was 10% in patients still using gc as compared to 34% and 36% in those who stopped and never used gc respectively ( p  <  0.001 ) .
overall , shoulder pul was  =  0 in 79% of patients , while middle pul was  =  0 in 4 ( 4% ) patients and distal pul was higher than 0 in all the patients .
baseline pul was significantly higher in those who never stopped gc than in those who stopped gc or never used gc ( global test p  <  0.001 ) and was lower in patients with age higher than 18 years ( global test , p  <  0.001 ) . while in the shoulder pul was close to zero for all the patients ( 71% in those who never stopped , 80% in those who stopped and 100% in those who never used gc , p  =  0.006 ) , the difference was very evident in the middle region ( mean in those who never stopped  =  24.02 , mean in those who stopped  =  15.20 and mean in those who never used gc  =  11.61 , p  <  0.001 ) .
