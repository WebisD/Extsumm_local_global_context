further , spread of multidrug - resistant p. aeruginosa strains expressing rmtc with and without an intact isecp1 element and ndm-1 is of major clinical concern and calls for further studies to limit the spread of such strains .
we describe an occurrence of 16s rmtases rmtc and rmtf in clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa co - producing blandm-1 . the rmtc and rmtf genes might have been acquired from plasmids as part of mobile genetic elements and finally integrated and stabilized on the chromosome , but the underlying mechanism of transmission needs to be elucidated .
a total of 130 consecutive p. aeruginosa isolates recovered from different clinical specimens at sanjay gandhi postgraduate institute of medical sciences in lucknow , uttar pradesh , india , during november 2013april 2014 were included in the study ; all specimens were collected from within the state ( figure 1 ) .
this result shows that rmtc , rmtf , and blandm-1 were located and stabilized on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa .
b ) chromosomal location of rmtc , rmtf , and blandm-1 genes by i - ceui - digested genomic dna of p. aeruginosa isolates .
the drug susceptibility profile was interpreted by using clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoints ( 7 ) .
