the association with stress resilience suggests that stress may be implicated in the aetiology of stroke , which is , in part , explained by poorer physical fitness among the less stress resilient .
a secondary aim was to examine whether other risk factors might mediate associations of stress resilience with stroke risk . at the end of follow - up
, we examine the association of stress resilience in adolescence with subsequent stroke risk in middle age within a general population - based cohort of male swedish residents . stress resilience was measured during the assessment for military conscription over 10  years prior to stroke and , therefore , not subject to differential reporting bias .
stress resilience may be a useful and underused measure for investigating the consequences of chronic stress in relation to stroke risk . here
we hypothesise that the most effective interventions to prevent stroke would focus on behaviour and lifestyle factors , as well as psychosocial stress .
the lowest stress resilience group ( 21.8% with scores 13 ) compared with the highest ( 23.7% with score 79 ) was associated with increased risk of all stroke types .
exposure to psychosocial stress has been identified by several recently conducted studies as a possible stroke risk.35 psychosocial stress , particularly with chronic exposure , is a feasible risk for stroke through its influence on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( hpa ) axis and sympathetic nervous system , which can result in inflammation and altered metabolic and cardiac autonomic control.6 moreover , stress may be related to lifestyle factors relevant to stroke risk , such as cigarette smoking , physical inactivity and alcohol intake.7 to date , the association between psychosocial stress and stroke has been investigated incompletely.8 recent case - control studies investigating this may have been limited by potential reporting bias , and exclusion of subjects who experienced fatal stroke , as the measure of exposure to stress was collected after onset of stroke.4

 5 limited duration of follow - up has not allowed examination of chronic exposure , which may be of particular relevance .
