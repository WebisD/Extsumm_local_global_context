recent long - term clinical researches have pointed out the increased risk of secondary meniscal damage and chondral lesion in patients with chronic acl deficiency.  the present study , therefore , was designed to evaluate the association between acl deficiency and its impact on meniscal and articular cartilage injury among groups of professional iranian athletes and also to determine whether there is a correlation between the timing of reconstruction and these types of injuries .
the duration between the time of injury and that of surgery was classified as <3 months ( group a ) , 3 - 6 months ( group b ) , 6 - 9 months ( group c ) , 9 - 18 months ( group d ) , 18 - 36 months ( group e ) , and > 36 months ( group f ) . in cases with meniscal tear , the data on individuals with total meniscus injury regardless of their grade were entered and those with partial tears were excluded .
after an interval of 6 months , there was a significant increase in the prevalence of chondral lesions ( chi square test , p = 0.008 ) [ table 3 ] . the incidence and severity of chondral injuries among 6 groups based on what was reported and identification by mri and arthroscopic findings , medial femoral condyl showed more prevalent chondral injuries ( 58.11% ) than lateral side due to acl deficiency .
