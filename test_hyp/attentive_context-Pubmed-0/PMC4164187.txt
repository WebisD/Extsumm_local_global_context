furthermore , in the presence of large skin exposures , the possibility of infection and the consequent negative effect on bone fusion associate the surgical procedure with a high risk of failure   .
the arthrodesis of the talonavicular joint and calcaneal - cuboid joint is technically complex in the presence of bone defect and there is a high incidence of nonunion .
in august 2012 , a 49-year - old - man presented to our hospital with a traumatic forefoot subamputation after a work accident . the trauma caused a lacerated wound in correspondence of the dorsal surface of the right foot .
furthermore , in the presence of large skin exposures , the possibility of infection and the consequent negative effect on bone fusion make the surgical procedure at high risk of failure .
midfoot fractures and dislocations are uncommon because of the intrinsic stability of the tarsal structure .
the surgical management was based on the principles for treatment of chopart joint fracture dislocations : realignment of both medial and lateral columns of the foot , restoration of joint congruity , alignment of axes , temporary fixation and ligament reconstruction to ensure proper ligament healing   .
primary arthrodesis is a viable option for severe midfoot fracture dislocations , because it facilitates rehabilitation and functional recovery and obviates the need for a secondary arthrodesis should arthritis arise .
