is detected by electron microscopy prior to the development of overt sclerosis [ 14 - 16 ] .
first , podocyte injury is the earliest morphologic feature of fsgs . in recurrent fsgs in the allograft kidney , podocyte injury
current research is focusing on the role of podocytes and interaction with pecs . understanding the mechanism of podocyte injury , its progression and possible recovery is important not only for basic research but also for daily diagnostic pathology practice .
injection of immunotoxin which binds to human cd25 induced podocyte - specific injury and fsgs occurred a few weeks later .
therefore , the pathogenesis of podocyte injury is a key to understand the characteristics of fsgs .
there are several observations indicating that podocyte injury is at the center of the development of fsgs .
mutation in the nphs1 gene and resulting loss of its product nephrin , are responsible for congenital nephrotic syndrome of finnish type .
have been reckoned as the initiating factor of podocyte injury in primary fsgs and its recurrence after transplantation .
as for the pathophysiology of podocyte injury , several mechanisms have been proposed with supporting evidences . circulating permeability factors
interestingly , mutation of arhgdia , which is responsible for nephrotic syndrome , increased migration activity of cultured podocytes .
