the technique , which has been recently revisited , permits dental rehabilitation in terms of raising the bone above the nerve , reshaping the alveolar crest , and normalizing the interocclusal distance and the crown - implant ratio .
moderate to severe posterior mandibular atrophy was successfully treated with interpositional sandwich osteotomy bone grafts .
the sandwich technique , which uses bone block graft positioned between osteotomized bony segments , was developed by schettler 21 in 1974 stoelinga and colleagues 22 combined the visor osteotomy and sandwich techniques to augment the severely atrophic edentulous mandible with success 22 .
a 49-year - old female patient was presented with a bilaterally atrophic mandible and a need for implant therapy .
the extensive loss of the alveolar ridge and teeth in the posterior mandible presents a complex case for reconstruction .
the titanium mesh used must be fixed by titanium screws , and infection is a common complication 18 that may cause loss of grafted bone , resulting in failure .
this led to the successful placement of implants and fixed prosthetic implant restorations , thus allowing ever more patients to be considered for implant treatment .
the augmentation procedure above the ian provides sufficient bone for implant placement and allows for long - term successful restoration of missing teeth with implant - supported prosthesis .
