we used the 1  week on/1  week off tmz regimen ( ddtmz ) for patients with relapsing gbm or other glioma after prior tmz or nitrosourea chemotherapy to study the efficacy and toxicity of ddtmz in heavily pre - treated patients with high - grade glioma .
the recently reported rtog 0525 trial on newly diagnosed gbm also failed to produce superior outcome of ddtmz in newly diagnosed gbm ( and regardless of the mgmt promoter status ) .
the median interval ( and range ) between the prior chemotherapy and the start of the ddtmz was 5  months ( 067  months ) in group a , 12.5  months ( range 192 ) in group b and 17  months ( range 194 ) in group c. the patients without 1p and 19q loss ( group a and b ) that started with
the ddtmz within 3  months of the previous chemotherapy ( 12 out of 40 patients ) had a lower pfs-6 compared to the patients with a chemotherapy free interval of more than 3  months ( pfs-6 8% vs. 43% ; fisher exact test 0.033).table  4outcome of patients treated with dose dense temozolomide for a progressive glioma after radiotherapy and 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapyoutcomeall patientsn  =  53group an  =  24group bn  =  16group cn  =  13pfs-640%29%38%62%pfs-1213%13%13%15%median os9  months6  months9  months19  monthscr  +  pr17%8%19%33% ( 4:12)pfs-6 progression free survival at 6  months , pfs-12 progression free survival at 12  months , os overall survival , cr complete response , pr partial responsegroup a patients with recurrent primary glioblastoma , group b patients with recurrent who grade 2 or 3 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma or oligo - astrocytoma without combined 1p and 19q loss and with a contrast enhancing lesion on mri , group c patients with recurrent who grade 2 or 3 oligodendroglioma or oligo - astrocytoma with combined 1p and 19q loss and with a contrast enhancing lesion on mri outcome of patients treated with dose dense temozolomide for a progressive glioma after radiotherapy and 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy pfs-6 progression free survival at 6  months , pfs-12 progression free survival at 12  months , os overall survival , cr complete response , pr partial response group a patients with recurrent primary glioblastoma , group b patients with recurrent who grade 2 or 3 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma or oligo - astrocytoma without combined 1p and 19q loss and with a contrast enhancing lesion on mri , group c patients with recurrent who grade 2 or 3 oligodendroglioma or oligo - astrocytoma with combined 1p and 19q loss and with a contrast enhancing lesion on mri
