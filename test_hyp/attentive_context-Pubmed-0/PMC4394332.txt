the incidence and prevalence of chronic heart failure ( chf ) increase with age , due to a combination of the physiological and anatomical changes associated with ageing , and the increasing frequency of co - morbid conditions , which predispose to chf .
this may be due to the presence of other co - morbidities ( such as chronic kidney disease ) being exclusion criteria , a refusal of elderly patients committing to multiple study visits over several years of follow - up ( limited mobility and functional impairment ) or even investigator bias ( deeming patients unsuitable or unlikely to participate ) .
it is a collaboration between physicians in cardiology , medicine for the elderly and general practice that will recruit a cohort of patients who are much more reflective of day - to - day clinical practice .
clinical trials require clear pre - determined eligibility criteria and rigorous follow - up . while some trials like solvd and merit - hf excluded those > 80 years of age , other key trials ( without age as a specific exclusion criterion ) also failed to recruit significant numbers of older patients .
the data behind these advances is generally derived from studies in younger subjects . yet with the changing demographics of our population , patients with chf are often older with complex co - morbidities . as such patients who are the largest users of health and social service resources are those for whom we have less evidence on which to base our treatment .
