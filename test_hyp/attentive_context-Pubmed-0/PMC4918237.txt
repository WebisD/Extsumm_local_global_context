it is mainly mediated by t cells6 interacting with antigen - presenting cells ( apc ) and other cells of the inflammatory milieu,7 giving rise to the inflammatory cascade that leads to joint damage and repair mechanisms . in this context , increasing evidence has recently suggested the importance of a new subset of t lymphocyte , named th17 according to its signature cytokine.8 the initial treatments of psa are non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , steroid intraarticular injections if a single joint is affected , shortly followed by one or more disease - modifying anti - rheumatic agents ( dmards ) in peripheral joint disease subsets . in clinical practice , and according to international and national guidelines,9,10 the most widely used dmards are methotrexate ( effective both in skin and joint manifestations ) , sulfasalazine , leflunomide , and cyclosporine a.1115 in  non - responders  and in the axial subset , anti - tnf agents are indicated in order to suppress inflammation and stop structural changes .
psoriatic arthritis ( psa ) is a frequent inflammatory disease that affects both peripheral and axial joints , enthuses , and the skin ( psoriatic dermatitis , ps ) .
