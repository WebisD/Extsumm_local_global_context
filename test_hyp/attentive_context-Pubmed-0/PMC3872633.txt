therefore , the aim of the present study was to test the null hypothesis that adjunctive use of ch with a self - etch adhesive ( se ) and a self - etch adhesive containing mdpb ( pb ) has no effect on immediate ( 24 h ) bond strength to dentin , or after water storage for 6 months plus thermocycling .
within the limitations of the current study , it may be concluded that although ch was capable of decreasing the loss of bond strength of the two - step self - etch adhesives to dentin over time , it compromised the initial bonding of the self - etch adhesives . thus , further in vitro and in vivo studies should be conducted before the combined application of ch , and two - step self - etch adhesives can be recommended in clinical practice .
the effect of ch , the interactions between adhesive type and time , between adhesive type and ch , and the interaction among all the three factors was not significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
the higher number of the adhesive fracture was detected in two groups of pb + ch and control group of pb ( 24 h ) .
