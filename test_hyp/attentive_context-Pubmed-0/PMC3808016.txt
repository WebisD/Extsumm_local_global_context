different surgical stages will be accompanied by diverse effects on hemodynamic variability and pulse oximetry . according to the present study , blood pressure and heart rate are significantly increased after anesthetic injection and are decreased in the following stages by the elimination of adrenaline stimulatory effect . moreover
significant differences were found between the first step and the second and the third ( p < 0.0001 ) , the second and the third steps and the other stages , the fourth step and the second and the third ( p < 0.0001 ) and the fifth ( p = 0.001 ) , and also the fifth step with the second and the third ( p < 0.0001 ) and the fourth ( p = 0.001 ) steps [ table 3 and figure 3 ] .
the equipments used in the study included ( 1 ) finger pulse oximeter ( soor afarinesh company ) , and ( 2 ) automatic sphygmomanometer ( omron company ) according to the following inclusion criteria , 50 patients ranging from 30 to 50 years participated in this study . in all patients , changes in heart rate , blood pressure , and also pulse oximetry
