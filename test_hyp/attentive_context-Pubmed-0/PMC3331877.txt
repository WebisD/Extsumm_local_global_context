to report the effective treatment of radiation macular edema following ruthenium-106 plaque brachytherapy for a choroidal melanoma with a dexamethasone 0.7-mg ( ozurdex ) intravitreal implant .
a 65-year - old caucasian woman was suffering from radiation macular edema following ruthenium-106 plaque brachytherapy for a choroidal melanoma on her left eye .
seven months after the development of radiation macular edema , she received a single intravitreal injection of dexamethasone 0.7 mg ( ozurdex ) .
radiation macular edema resolved with a reduction of central retinal thickness from 498 m before ozurdex injection to 224 m after ozurdex injection , as measured by oct scan .
dexamethasone 0.7 mg ( ozurdex ) has proven to be an effective treatment option in retinal vein occlusion and noninfectious uveitis .
four weeks following the injection , her best - corrected visual acuity improved from 0.3 to 0.5 .
she had undergone one intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg bevacizumab ( avastin , genentech / roche ) in the following months without functional or anatomical improvement .
it can also be considered as off - label treatment in radiation macular edema following ruthenium-106 plaque brachytherapy for a choroidal melanoma .
radiation retinopathy is a predictable complication after radioactive scleral plaque application for treatment of intraocular tumors , most commonly choroidal melanoma .
