the statistical analyses revealed functional diversity and enrichment of acetylation , while network studies generated a large number of potentially useful results for further experimental or computational researches . the cpla database will be routinely updated if new acetylated substrates are reported .
, we only focused on protein lysine acetylation and manually curated 7151 lysine acetylation sites in 3311 proteins . since a large proportion of acetylation sites were taken from homo sapiens , we had the opportunity to analyze abundance and functional diversity of lysine acetylation in an acetylomic level .
for example , the three most abundant biological processes such as translational elongation , rna splicing and mrna processing suggest that acetylation predominantly regulates gene expression in a post - transcriptional manner ( table 2 ) .
based on the gene ontology ( go ) and interpro annotations , we carried out an analysis of functional diversities and regulatory roles of lysine acetylation .
since the number of known acetylation sites has rapidly increased , it is an urgent topic to collect the experimental data and provide an integrated resource for the community .
recent progresses toward understanding the full functional content of acetylome have experimentally revealed several thousands of lysine acetylated substrates with their sites . besides experimental efforts ,
