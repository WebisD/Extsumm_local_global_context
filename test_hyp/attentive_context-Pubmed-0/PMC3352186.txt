although uicc stages generally correlate with outcome in a large percentage of cancer patients , refined prediction of the individual disease course would facilitate clinical decision making , e.g. early requirement of adjuvant therapy .
one of the aims of the present study was , therefore , to investigate whether the common t393c snp in the gene gnas1 , may be predictive for survival or disease - free survival in patients with malignant melanoma .
c - allele carriers have an increased risk for tumor progression when compared to patients with the homozygous 393tt genotype , the latter group showing both a longer relapse - free survival and a later requirement for secondary therapy . together with our previous observations showing that the t393c snp is a predictive marker for outcome in bladder cancer , renal cell carcinoma   and colorectal cancer , the present results confirm the potential role of this snp as a universal genetic marker for predicting tumor progression .
