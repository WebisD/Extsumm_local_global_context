consequently , this study aims to assess mr imaging findings distinguishing orbital cavernous haemangiomas from schwannomas and to elaborate on specific differences between the two tumours .
mr imaging , especially dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging , plays a vital role in the differential diagnosis of cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas .
cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas have different mr imaging features including the location , configuration and margins of the mass , signal intensity and homogeneity on t1- and t2-weighted imaging , the spread pattern of contrast enhancement , the enhancement pattern and tic type , which could be helpful in the differentiation of the two tumours .
the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement on dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging is the most reliable finding distinguishing cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas .
markedly homogeneous hyperintensity signal on t2-weighted imaging is another reliable finding distinguishing the two tumours .
orbital cavernous haemangiomas , the most common primary orbital tumour in adults , demonstrate a predilection to affect middle - aged women ( 6070% ) , with a mean age of 43 to 48  years and range of 18 to 72  years based on several large series   .
there was a significant difference between cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas regarding the location ( including anterior orbit , posterior orbit , or both anterior and posterior orbit ; extraconal or intraconal space ) , configuration and margins of the mass , signal intensity and homogeneity on t1- and t2-weighted imaging , the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement , enhancement pattern and type of time
