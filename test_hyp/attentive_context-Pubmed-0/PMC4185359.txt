we present a case of 42-year - old male diagnosed preoperatively as left inguinal hernia with normal ultrasonography findings , who found to have tte on exploration .
a 42-year - old married male , having three children , presented to us with history of swelling over left inguinal region for 2 years .
transverse testicular ectopia ( tte ) is an uncommon anatomical abnormality in which both the gonads migrate towards the same hemiscrotum .
an inguinal hernia is commonly present on the side to which the ectopic testis has migrated .
this case is reported with a view that surgeons need to be aware of this anomaly during repair of inguinal hernia , as most cases of tte are diagnosed intraoperatively , hence adequately and safely treat the patient even with tte when discovered unexpectedly , continue long - term follow - up to identify malignancy early , if any .
patients with tte need to be treated by restoring the contralateral testis to its original hemiscrotum through a trans - septal incision .
the case presented here was managed by orchidopexy of the correctly lateralized testis to the ipsilateral hemiscrotum , and orchidopexy of the crossed testis to the contralateral hemiscrotum through a trans - septal incision , known as the ombredanne procedure .
