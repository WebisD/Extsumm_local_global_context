polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age .
there have been no demonstrable teratogenic effects , intra - uterine deaths , still births or developmental delays reported with metformin use in pregnancy . despite these favorable effects of metformin use with scarce serious side effects , no definite guidelines recommending metformin use in pregnant women with pcos exists and hence further research on the topic
its use in patients with pcos during pregnancy reduces a number of pregnancy - related complications , such as gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension .
use of metformin throughout pregnancy in women with pcos has shown to reduce the rates of early pregnancy loss , preterm labor , and prevention of fetal growth restriction .
it has encouraging effects on several metabolic aspects of polycystic ovarian syndrome , such as insulin sensitivity , plasma glucose and lipid profile .
pcos produces symptoms in approximately 5 to 10% of women of reproductive age ( 1245 years old ) and is thought to be one of the leading causes of the female subfertility .
other conditions with similar presenting signs , such as androgen - secreting tumors or cushing 's syndrome , must be ruled out before a diagnosis of pcos is established .
