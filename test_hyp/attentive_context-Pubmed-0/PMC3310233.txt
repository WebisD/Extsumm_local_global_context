how can we utilize accumulating biological data of disc1 to discover novel therapeutic targets and biological markers for major mental conditions ? here , we will review disc1-associated molecular pathways which have the potential to be novel therapeutic targets , with particular focus on well documented disc1 pathways involved in cerebral cortex development and function ( figure 1 ) .
we will also discuss the potential link of disc1 pathways and environmental factors , such as immune / inflammatory responses , to explore therapeutic interventions based on understanding disease mechanisms of genetic and environmental interaction .
in fact , many protein binding partners of disc1 are associated with various molecular pathways that regulate fundamental cellular processes for brain development and function ( table 1 ) .
nonetheless , it is still unknown which functional aspects of disc1 directly affect molecular mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility .
disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ( disc1 ) was initially discovered at the breakpoint in a balanced chromosomal translocation t ( 1 ; 11 ) segregating with major mental conditions , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and major depression in a scottish pedigree ( millar et al . , 2000 ) . since then , accumulating evidence from genetic studies indicated that disc1 is not only associated with schizophrenia and mood disorders , but also other psychiatric disorders of neurodevelopmental origin , such as autism , asperger syndrome , and agenesis of the corpus callosum ( hennah et al . , 2003 ; hodgkinson et al . , 2004
