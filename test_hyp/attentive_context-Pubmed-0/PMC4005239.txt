both operative and postoperative complications do occur in dsek and increases with the longer postoperative follow - up , but all very much within acceptable limit .
price and price reported a dislocation rate of 50% in the first 10 eyes undergoing dsaek , which was reduced to 13% in the next 126 cases after changing the procedure to include face - up positioning after surgery and smoothening of the corneal surface .
the re - dsek procedure can be easily performed in most of the failed cases with satisfactory results .
