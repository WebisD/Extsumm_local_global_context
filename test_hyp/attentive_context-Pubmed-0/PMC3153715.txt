this study compares the efficacy and safety of arformoterol and salbutamol delivered by nebulization in the management of acute non - severe asthma .
further studies are thus needed to clarify the efficacy , actual dose , dose frequency , cost - effectiveness , and long - term safety of arformoterol in acute exacerbations of asthma and copd with different levels of severity .
the increases in pefr after the first and the second dose were significantly more with arformoterol than with salbutamol , but the increase in pefr after the third dose was similar in these two groups . the comparison of improvement following the therapy with salbutamol and arformoterol is shown in table 2 .
improvement in pefr after each dose of bronchodilator when compared with the baseline both drugs were well tolerated ; no major adverse effect was noted in either group .
in both the groups , pefr showed significant increase over the baseline values and the increase was evident after each dose of the drug .
a total of 50 patients attending the emergency room or chest opd of a tertiary care hospital with acute non - severe asthma over a 6-month period from january 2010 to june 2010 were selected for this study .
