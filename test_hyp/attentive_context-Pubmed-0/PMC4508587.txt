the second objective was to establish the correlation between sputum cellularity and other indirect parameters used to evidence bronchial inflammation ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
our study s main objective was the analysis of the sputum cellularity in patients with ba in correlation with the level of disease control and the controlling therapy  with / without inhaled glucocorticoid ( igc ) .
this studies highlights that in uncontrolled asthmatic patients that do not respond to the glucocorticoid therapy , the explanation rises from the presence of a high percent of neutrophils in sputum .
sputum cellularity evidenced the existence of statistically significant differences both for eosinophils ( p=0.049 ) and neutrophils ( p=0.004 ) between patients with controlled ba and those with partial or uncontrolled disease . in patients with controlled ba
our study evidenced higher eosinophils and neutrophils values in the sputum of patients with partially controlled or uncontrolled ba than in those with controlled asthma .
higher neutrophils levels were found in patients with uncontrolled asthma , both in those under igc therapy and those without this treatment ( table iv ) . analyzing the sputum cellularity in relation to spirometric parameters , we found higher eosinophils counts in patients with fev1 80% as compared with those with normal fev1 ( meansd : 40.330.3% versus 10.611.9% , p=0.003 ) ( table v ) . when analyzing fev1 in patients with high eosinophils values , we observed the existence of a moderate to good indirect correlation ( r=0.56 , p=0.005 ) , but the correlation was not present for patients with normal eosinophils values ( figure 1 ) .
