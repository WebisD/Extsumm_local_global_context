hyperammonaemia is a regular finding in shock   , and the latter is one of high - dose nitrogen mustards acute effects . to elucidate the role of the digestive tract luminal ammonia in the toxic action of nitrogen mustard - derived alkylating agent cyclophosphamide , the single high - dose administration of cyclophosphamide at the background of a gavage with ammonium acetate ( aa )
in rats , the increase of the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool by the mean of an oral gavage with nonlethal dose of ammonium acetate enhanced the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide while promoting its lethal action .
the administration of cyclophosphamide in dose 1000 or 1400  mg / kg resulted in tremor , the loss of righting , and audiomotor reflexes within 3  h ; within 16  h the soporose state was incidentally superposed by tonic seizures .
no noticeable symptoms of intoxication were observed within 0.5  h after the administration of cyclophosphamide in any dose but 1400  mg / kg . the increase of blood ammonia , glutamine , and urea was observed within 3  h after the administration of cyclophosphamide and ( or ) aa . at the background of their combined dosing ,
