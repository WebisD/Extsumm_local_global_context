in conclusion , our study does not support the role of winter - time relatively high - dose vitamin d3 supplementation as a means to improve glucose homeostasis in a general ageing population with prediabetes but suggests a modest anti - inflammatory effect .
furthermore , we assessed the anti - inflammatory effect of the supplementation by measurements of serum high - sensitive c - reactive protein ( hscrp ) , plasma soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type ii ( pstnfrii ) , plasma interleukin-6 ( pil-6 ) , plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( pil-1ra ) , and plasma interleukin-1 beta ( pil-1 ) concentrations .
we repeated the analyses by including also those with bmi > 35 at the start of the supplementation period , those who started their own high - dose vitamin d supplementation during the trial , or the one with low compliance ( n = 71 ) .
insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , and type 2 diabetes are associated with a systemic , chronic inflammation , where , for example , circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and c - reactive protein are elevated   . although vitamin d has immunomodulatory and anti - inflammatory properties , especially based on experimental studies , bodies of evidence from human studies in the prediabetic state assessing the role of moderate to large dose supplementation of vitamin d in inflammation and glucose metabolism are still relatively few . as more evidence is clearly needed , we decided to study the placebo - controlled effect of 5-month 40  g / d ( 1,600  iu ) or 80  g / d ( 3,200  iu ) oral vitamin d3 supplementation on glucose homeostasis in an eastern finnish population with either impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) or igt during winter time when serum vitamin d3 concentrations drop without supplementation .
