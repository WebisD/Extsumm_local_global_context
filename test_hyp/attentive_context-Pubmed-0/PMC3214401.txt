we also classified patients based on age , sex , performance status ( according to the eastern cooperative oncology group ) , international prognostic index ( ipi ) score , presence of b symptoms , clinical stage , serum lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) level , primary site and treatment protocol .
ramadan et al . reported patients with advanced - stage disease who received chemotherapy plus irradiation with a poor outcome when compared with those who received chemotherapy alone ( 10-years os were 25% and 56% , respectively).4 however , this difference must be very cautiously interpreted because the decision to use radiotherapy was individualized . because of small number of patients in our study , further studies are necessary to clarify the characteristics of pbl and its optimal treatment strategy .
several studies have suggested that the combined modality ( chemotherapy and radiotherapy ) was the best treatment for patients with pbl.36 beal et al . concluded that pbl patients treated with combination chemotherapy and irradiation had significantly better survival than the patients treated with single modality ( chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone ) , but the 5-year os rate between the two groups was not significantly different.16 in our study , os and dfs was significantly better in combined modality group ( os was 64 vs. 27 months , respectively , p=0.014 , and dfs was 64 vs. 21 months , p=0.003 ) .
