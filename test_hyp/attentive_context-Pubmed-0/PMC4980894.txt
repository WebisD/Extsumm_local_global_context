the presence of nss and cognitive deficits in ocd is indicative of underlying neuroanatomical and neurophysiological dysfunction and that ocd is a brain disease .
nss in our ocd patients were significantly higher in all the subscales of motor coordination , sensory integration , complex motor tests , right / left and spatial orientation , and hard signs .
ocd patients showed significant deficits in short - term memory task ( p < 0.001 ) , visuospatial ability ( p
nss were present to a significantly greater extent in ocd patients than controls in our study .
ocd affects the younger population and is known to cause significant impairment in individual social and occupational productivity .
ocd patients showed significant deficits in short - term memory task ( p < 0.001 ) , visuospatial ability ( p
this disability can now be linked to the defective higher mental functions secondary to neurological dysfunction and not just the obsessive symptomatology as thought previously .
in last two decades following advances in neuroimaging studies , there has been growing interest in studying the neurological soft signs ( nss ) and cognitive function in obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) , a disorder which was earlier explained only on basis of psychoanalytical theories .
