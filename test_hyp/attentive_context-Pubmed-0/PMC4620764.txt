the purpose of the present study was to collect data among children who were suspected with chromosomal disorders from january 1 , 2011 to march 31 , 2014 in the children 's hospital , zhejiang university , and tried to establish and update our previous database of common chromosomal anomalies that could be useful for genetic counseling and reminding the medical professionals which kind of patients should be transferred to genetic analysis .
our tertiary care referral center previously reported the results of cytogenetic survey from 1996 to 2010 , which allowed us to closely gain insight into the incidence and distribution of the cytogenetic abnormalities in outpatient children suspected with congenital disorders .
this study demonstrated the detection rates of chromosome abnormalities in children who were suspected with chromosomal disorders .
there were 769 children who had chromosome abnormalities , accounting for 18.62% of all referral cases . among the affected , the percentage of sex - linked chromosomal abnormalities in all was 23.8% .
the detection rate of autosomal anomalies was higher in boys ( 16.6% vs 12.2% ,   =  16.6 , p  <  0.001 ) , but the detection rate of sex - linked chromosomal anomalies was higher in girls than that in boys ( 5.6% vs 3.0% ,   =  17.2 , p  <  0.001 ) .
