a 70-year - old caucasian male presented with a one - year history of progressive worsening blue - gray discoloration of the face .
any patient receiving more than 100 grams of minocycline can develop discoloration.4 the pigment deposition is the result of a drug metabolite - protein complex chelated with calcium , or an insoluble minocycline - melanin complex.5 minocycline hyperpigmentation occurs in 2.4% to 14.8% of patients on chronic treatment , most commonly for acne and rosacea.5 in a study of 700 patients on high - dose long - term minocycline treatment for acne ( 100 mg daily , 100/200 mg on alternate days , or 200 mg daily for 10.5 months ) , the only side effect that was significantly greater in patients taking higher doses ( cumulative dose greater than 70 g ) compared with lower doses was pigmentation ( p < 0.01).6 its anti - inflammatory effects are helpful for rheumatoid arthritis , immunobullous disease and other inflammatory diseases.3 the incidence of minocycline pigmentation is higher in patients treated for autoimmune diseases and may be more common with increasing age.3 q - switched lasers use high energy , nanosecond pulsing and are available in 3 wavelengths for drug - induced pigmentation , including the ruby 694 nm , the alexandrite 755 nm , and the nd : yag infrared 1064 nm.7 there have been reports of the alexandrite laser leading to the resolution of type ii minocycline induced hyperpigmentation.6 other reports have shown efficacy of the ruby laser for minocycline facial and leg pigmentation.8,9 a single study compared the yag and ruby lasers in the treatment of minocycline pigmentation and the ruby laser was found to be more effective.9 however , there are no studies comparing the 3 q - switched lasers for effectiveness and patient comfort in the treatment of minocycline - induced hyperpigmentation .
