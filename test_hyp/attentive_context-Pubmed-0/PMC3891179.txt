total 112 patients of osteoarthritis of knee were allocated at two clinical centers during the period july 2006 to march 2007 .
the study is aimed at evaluating the long - term ( six month ) efficacy and safety of abfn02 and compares it with glucosamine sulphate .
however the potential hepato - toxicity demands thorough phytochemical analysis for identification and optimization of phyto - actives and minimization of phyto - toxic components . experimental studies with identified in - vitro and in - vivo models for better insight in mechanisms of action would help further improvise this age old classical ayurvedic product and evaluate its disease modifying role in the management of osteoarthritis .
patients were evaluated before treatment ( baseline ) , at periodic intervals ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 weeks ) during treatment and after completion of treatment ( 24 weeks ) .
flow of patients participation in three arm study of abfn02 ( pulse dosage regimen and continuous dosage regimen ) and glucosamine sulphate ( gs ; standard dosage regimen ) the adherence was measured depending on the continuation of the treatment for six months .
tnf- sr - i and sr - ii values remained in normal range for pre and post treatment evaluation ; tnf-  sr - i , group a ( 2.41  0.85 to 2.77  0.95 ) , group b ( 2.67  0.80 to 2.74  1.10 ) , group c ( 2.33  0.73 to 2.46  0.60 ) and tnf-  sr - ii group a ( 7.77  2.58 to 7.23  2.32 ) , group b ( 7.11  2.61to 7.16  6.27 ) , group c ( 6.93  2.22 to 5.87  1.91 ) .
