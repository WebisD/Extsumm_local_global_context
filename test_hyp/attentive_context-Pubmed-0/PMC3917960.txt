although global gene content and detailed sequence similarity comparisons with the previously described megaviridae members clearly classify pgv within the family ( including the partially sequenced organic lake phycodnaviruses ( olpv ) , chrysochromulina erecina virus , and phaoecystis pouchetti virus ) , the finding of a pgv - associated virophage came as a surprise .
the first published phylogenetic tree including mimivirus 2 and using a concatenation of 7 universally conserved protein sequences , already pointed out that :  we could now build a tentative tree of life , within which mimivirus appears to define a new branch distinct from the three other domains .  elsewhere in the same article , mimivirus was also shown to be part of the broad family of the nucleocytoplasmic large dna viruses ( ncldv ) , branching near the middle of the previously defined iridovirus , phycodnaviruses , poxviruses , and asfarviruses lineages . put together , these 2 results suggested in a subliminal way that all the large dna viruses were in fact defining a domain distinct from the 3 established cellular domains . as additional genomes of megaviridae became available ,
another lesson is that , like all parasites , the virophages are submitted to the irreversible phenomenon of reductive evolution , condemning them to disappear as individual biological entities , eventually saving some of their genes by integrating them into the genome of their companion virus , themselves undergoing a similar process vis -  - vis their cellular host .
