this clinical report describes prosthetic rehabilitation of large midfacial defect with a magnet retained combined two piece acrylic resin - silicone facial prosthesis .
a 68-year - old male patient was referred for facial rehabilitation after surgical excision of left maxilla due to an underlying severe fungal infection mucormycosis .
prosthetic rehabilitation was done with magnet retained two piece prosthesis having hollow acrylic resin framework and a silicone facial prosthesis .
thus , to avoid recurrence of lesion and financial constraint of the patient , implant supported prosthesis was not planned for this case .
thus , it can be concluded that prosthetic rehabilitation of large facial defects is a challenging task which requires critical understanding of available anatomic structures and prosthesis designs to achieve maximum retention , stability , and esthetics .
various methods of auxiliary retention for facial prostheses which have been described in the literature were used in this case including eyeglasses , tissue undercuts , magnets , adhesives , and combinations of the above . in this case retention of prosthesis
a 68-year - old , male patient was referred to department of prosthodontics for orofacial rehabilitation .
a prosthesis that is lifelike in appearance provides a sense of psychological security to the patient , and the physical wearing comfort becomes a primary prerequisite for the patient .
