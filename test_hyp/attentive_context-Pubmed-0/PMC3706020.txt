this study underlines that , in terms of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases and cancers , the health condition of the population exposed to the industrial air pollution was similar to those of nonexposed people .
we found a significant increase of the risk to be hospitalized for myocardial infarction in the districts exposed to industrial air pollution , especially in women ( table 6 ) .  
however , the results illustrate the impact of industrial air pollution on the cardiovascular system .   efforts should be done to decrease the levels of so2 , particles , and some carcinogenic compounds emitted by the industries , by improving industrial processes and using less polluted fuels . for instance , decreasing the level of road traffic particles would require the implementation of an interurban public transport network , as well as the development of rail transport for raw materials and goods .
excess risk to be hospitalized for mi in women living in districts with medium or high so2 exposure was , respectively , 38% [ ci 95% 4%  :  83% ] and 54% [ 14%  : 
this index was significantly correlated with the socio - occupational group but moderately with so2 exposure levels ( coefficient of correlation = 0.4 ) .
