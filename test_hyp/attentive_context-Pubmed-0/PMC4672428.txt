we report 2 cases of mers - cov infection in men who had direct contact with the same group of infected dromedaries .
however , given that a single introduction of mers - cov from this clade caused > 180 human infections in hospital settings ( 2 ) and that viruses of this clade are causing other human infections in saudi arabia , further phenotypic risk assessment of this particular mers - cov clade should be a priority .
neither man had a concurrent medical condition or a history of exposure to human mers cases in the 14 days before their first mers - cov  positive test results .
additional information regarding 2 persons with asymptomatic mers - cov infection and other persons tested in the study .
genomic sequences for the viruses derived from the men and dromedaries and findings from the epidemiologic investigation suggest possible zoonotic transmission of mers - cov from dromedaries to humans .
phylogenetic analyses of partial middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) genomic sequences for viruses detected in dromedaries imported from oman to united arab emirates , may 2015 .
mers - cov genomic sequences determined in this study are similar to those of viruses detected in 2015 in patients in saudi arabia and south korea with hospital - acquired infections .
