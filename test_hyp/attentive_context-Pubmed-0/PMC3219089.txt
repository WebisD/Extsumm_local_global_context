function insights in mitochondrial complex i have been previously obtained from the analysis of mutations in the nd genes that are associated with human diseases .
we present the correspondence between the bacterial proteins and the mitochondrial nd subunits , with the human ones as reference for all organisms .
however , this hypothesis is just a new view of assembling together recent structural information for bacterial complex i with previous evidence accumulated for mitochondrial complex i and render it attractive to the cell death field
the vast majority of mitochondrial genomes contain seven genes that form the membrane domain of complex i , which are labeled nd1 to nd6 plus nd4l ( table 1 ) .
pathogenic lhon mutations have been shown to alter the reaction with either the q substrate or the quinol product of complex i and decrease its binding to q - antagonist inhibitors , for example , rotenone .
disruptive mutations in nd subunits , mostly affecting the assembly of complex i , are commonly found as somatic mutations in oncocytic tumors , but not as germline maternally inherited mutations associated with human diseases , because of their lethality . instead , many missense mutations affecting conserved residues in nd subunits are causative of human diseases , ranging from mono - symptomatic pathologies , such as leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( lhon ) , to more severe and multi - systemic clinical phenotypes , such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis and stroke - like syndrome ( melas ) and leigh syndrome .
