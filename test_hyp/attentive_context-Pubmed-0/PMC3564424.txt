this analysis shows that the focus of collaboration needs to be clearly defined and agreed upon , there needs to be a high degree of equality between the professionals involved , and there has to be a will to co - operate based on a shared understanding of values and learning potentials .
the follow - up home visit programme in copenhagen suffered from a lack of motivation among key actors ( especially gps ) to participate and , as a result , readmissions to hospital can be expected to be higher than anticipated prior to the programme .
one lesson for current policy is that motivational factors need to be addressed in future collaborative programs in order to fully exploit the potential health benefits .
the findings support a basic claim in inter - organizational theory that other factors than resources matter if we want to understand what drives efforts at collaboration .
a response to this challenge has been to focus on integrated health care and co - ordination between the actors involved in the process   .
this perspective has shown us that we need to have a comprehensive view of the factors which make health sector organisations work together .
