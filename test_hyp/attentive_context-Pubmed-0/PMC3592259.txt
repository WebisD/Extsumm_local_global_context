in particular , we analyse the question of whether push programmes may provide the basis for subsequent applied research in the pharmaceutical industry by promoting basic ( non - patentable ) research . in addition
, we analyse which incentive mechanisms mitigate the problem of underinvestment in r&d for medicines for neglected diseases .
, we analyse the conditions under which pull mechanisms may help to reduce market uncertainty and increase the expected market for targeted drugs or medicines for neglected diseases.figure 1push and pull r&d incentive programmes and selected examples 
  push and pull r&d incentive programmes and selected examples we selected the programmes under study on the basis of four criteria .
infectious diseases are a major reason for the health disparity between rich and poor countries ( stiglitz and jayadev , 2010 ) .
strengthening local health systems and setting an appropriate legal framework will need continued attention in order to reduce the neglected disease burden in the developing world .
figure 1 provides an overview of the push and pull programmes and selected examples as discussed in the article . while both types of programmes aim to increase the incentives to allocate resources into neglected disease research , they differ in their approaches .
