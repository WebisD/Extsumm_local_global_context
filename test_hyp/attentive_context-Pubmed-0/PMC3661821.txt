clinical characteristics of patients with t1d and control subjects when analyzing male and female subjects separately , the results were the same as for the whole t1d group both for t1d males ( t1d males vs. controls , z - ls 1.0  1.1 vs. 0.4  0.67 , p < 0.001 , and z - fn 1.0  1.1 vs. 0.35  0.6 , p < 0.001 ; subjects with vfx 23.1 vs. 4.5% , p = 0.078 , respectively ) and t1d females ( t1d female patients vs. controls , z - ls 0.34  1.3 vs. 0.32  1.1 , p = 0.003 , and z - fn 0.45  1.2 vs. 0.27  1.0 , p = 0.01 ; subjects with vfx 25 vs. 6.7% , p = 0.009 , respectively ) . comparing t1d patients with and without vfx , no differences were found in age , bmi , sex distribution , diabetes duration , age at t1d manifestation , hba1c , renal function , and physical activity ( table 2 ) .
odds ratios for the presence of vfx after adjustment for lumbar spine bmd and other risk factors in the whole sample of t1d patients and controls , the presence of vfx of only moderate or severe grade was significantly associated with bmd at the lumbar spine ( odds ratio 2.78 [ 95% ci , 1.097.14 ] ; p = 0.033 ) , but not with t1d ( 2.20   ; p = 0.51 ) after adjusting for age ( 1.06   ; p = 0.28 ) , male sex ( 2.50   ; p = 0.28 ) , and bmi ( 1.04   ; p = 0.69 ) .
