all of these developments and the promissing progress in the field of human and medical genetics inspired several of the founders and leaders of these disciplines in this region to create the red latinoamericana de gentica humana ( relagh ) in the early 1990s , with the aim of creating a network for human genetics researchers , students , and practitioners in latin america and the caribbean ; the goal of this network was to contribute to the development of collaborative projects for education , research and assistance , and to represent the region before the international federation of human genetics societies ( ifhgs ) .
the implementation of national directories of medical genetics services and diagnostic laboratories may be a step forward in accomplishing these tasks , and the current presidency of the relagh is working towards this goal .
the primary goals for this period were to draft and propose the bylaws of the network ; to consolidate relagh as a representative of latin america in the ifhgs ; to set up the network website and use it as the main communication tool between relagh members ; to expand the relagh membership , and promote relagh as a hub for collaboration among human genetics groups in the latin american region ; and to organize the latin american school of human and medical genetics ( elag ) .
