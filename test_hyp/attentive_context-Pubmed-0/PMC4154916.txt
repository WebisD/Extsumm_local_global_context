herein , we report the results of our cross - sectional analyses of hcv genotype distribution and its association with certain clinical features in patients with chronic hcv infection in khuzestan province conducted from september 2006 to september 2009 . 


 during a three year period ( between september 2006 and september 2009 ) , we conducted a cross - sectional study on 223 consecutive hcv positive individuals who referred to the ahwaz jundishapour university hospitals ( ajsuh ) and hepatitis clinic .
knowledge on the distribution of various genotypes in our area is essential for its prognostic implications in chronic hepatitis c infection .
in this study , 64 ( 28.7% ) of 223 patients received blood transfusions before 1995 , whereas 5 ( 2.25% ) of 64 patients were positive for hcv rna who received transfusions after 1995 . 

these observations have led us to determine hcv genotypes , particularly in the region of khuzestan province , southwest iran , which has no available data on hcv genotypes . 
 

rflp identified hcv genotypes in 181 of 223 samples , whereas 42 cases could not be sub - typed with this method . 
 

possible routes of infection were recognized in 181 ( 81.2% ) patients . among these , patients with a history of ivdu , blood transfusion recipients , undergoing chronic hemodialysis , history of tattooing , accidental inoculation and non - marital sexual contact comprised 42.6% , 23.3 % , 4.93% , 3.15% , 0.9% and 0.9% of samples , respectively ( table 1 ) .
