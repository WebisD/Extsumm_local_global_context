this retrospective study included a total of 30 treatment - nave patients who were diagnosed with pd ( study group ) and 25 age- and sex - matched healthy volunteers ( control group ) between 18 and 59 years of age in the emergency medicine department of harran university .
therefore , we aimed to evaluate , for the first time , the rdw levels combined with mpv levels in patients with pd .
the wbc , mpv , and rdw levels were significantly higher in the patients with pd , compared to healthy controls ( p=0.001 , p=0.001 , and p=0.003 , respectively ) .
this study is the first to demonstrate that patients with pd have significantly higher rdw levels , compared to the healthy controls . in addition , wbc , mpv , and rdw levels were significantly higher in the patient group , compared to the control group .
the mean wbc , mpv , and rdw levels were 9,173.032,400.31/mm , 8.191.13 fl , and 12.471.14% , respectively , in the study group .
these values were found to be 7,090.241,032.61 , 6.850.67 , and 11.630.85 , respectively , in the healthy controls .
in conclusion , this study is the first to demonstrate that the rdw levels combined with mpv levels significantly increase in patients with pd . we think that the increase in rdw and mpv levels can be attributed to the increase in sympathetic activity .
