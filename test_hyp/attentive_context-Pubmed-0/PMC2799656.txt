further studies that will include various size stent protrusions and different wire thicknesses , as well as measurements of the aneurysm sac pressure , are necessary for improving our understanding of the long - term safety of fenestrated stent graft repair of aaa .
although based on two sample patients , our results provide a basis for testing the effect of placing a fenestrated vessel stent into the renal artery , and our research findings provide insight into the treatment outcome of fenestrated endovascular repair .
the wall shear stress was reduced to some extent following implantation of the renal stents , indicating the potential risk of thrombus formation or stenosis at the renal arteries .
changes of the aortic flow pattern were noted with placement of the fenestrated stent grafts and these changes were consistent with those reported in the literature ( 23 - 25 ) .
, our preliminary study using the fsi method shows that the interference of fenestrated stents with the renal blood flow is minimal and our study demonstrates an insignificant hemodynamic effect , indicating the safety of placing fenestrated stents into the renal arteries .
based on assessing the streamline in the pre- and post - fenestrated geometries , flow recirculation patterns were observed in the pre - operative geometry that were not seen in the post - graft implantation where the flow was mostly attached to the graft .
