the traces of lp activation in the fluid phase and local glomerular tissues have been shown to accumulate in a subpopulation of igan .
after discovering new molecules which belong to the lectin pathway ( lp ) , we came to believe there is accumulating evidence to support a hypothesis of the occurrence of lp activation in the pathogenesis of igan .
is highly detected in glomeruli and the detection rate is found in more than 90% of patients of igan   . since other complement molecules , such as properdin and c5 , are colocated in the mesangial areas with iga , but c1q is absent and there is an increase of c3 breakdown products in the serum of patients with igan , we had recognized that alternative pathway ( ap ) activation is involved in the pathogenesis of igan .
it appears that the activations of ap and lp are very much involved in the pathogenesis of igan .
it is generally agreed that up to 30% of patients with igan eventually progress to end - stage kidney disease .
the main body was separated into three parts ,  in circulation ,   in kidney ,  and  infection and clinical course .
