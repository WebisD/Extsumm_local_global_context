therefore , the available knowledge regarding cwi maintenance during plant development and in yeast will be covered here only briefly to provide a conceptual framework regarding cellular processes involved and to illustrate the degree of functional conservation between species .
this review will focus on recent developments regarding the role of cwi maintenance during biotic stress responses .
it will discuss how cwi maintenance could have a previously unrecognized role in the perception of and response to biotic stress .
similarities between the yeast and plant cwi maintenance mechanisms have also been reviewed ( hamann and denness , 2011 ) .
the available evidence suggests that a dedicated plant cell wall integrity ( cwi ) maintenance mechanism exists ( wolf et al . , 2011 ) . while our understanding of the mechanisms regulating stress responses and morphogenesis has increased significantly , our knowledge regarding the processes maintaining cwi is still limited . in the last years
the reason being , that by removing the potentially multiple effects of the pathogen during infection , they reduce the complexity of the interaction and should therefore allow novel insights into the mechanisms responsible for detection of infection and/or physical damage .
several reviews have been published on the plant cwi maintenance mechanism illustrating the increased interest in this area ( humphrey et al .
