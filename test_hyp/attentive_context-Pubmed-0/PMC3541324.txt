, we review the recent progress in the study of tension - sensing by focal adhesion proteins and actin filaments , and evaluate the possible physiological roles of such tension - sensing by actin filaments .
a recent in vitro biophysical study has shown that the apparent actin filament severing activity of cofilin and the rates of binding of cofilin to actin filaments are both affected by the tension present in the actin filaments,23 implying that the actin filament itself works as a mechanosensor . here
generally focal adhesions comprise a high stress concentration site , linking extracellular matrices and the actin cytoskeleton.15 mechanical forces imposed from inside or outside of the cell are transmitted through the focal adhesions bidirectionally , i.e. , in an outside - in or inside - out direction.16 exogenous mechanical forces are exerted on integrins , an extracellular matrix receptor enriched in focal adhesions that activate a variety of intracellular signaling cascades.17 - 19 the activities of actin modulating proteins20 are also influenced by endogenous cell contractile force21 or exogenous mechanical stimuli.6,7 thus , mechanosensors22 and directly associated signaling molecules15 are thought to be involved in the focal adhesion , the actin cytoskeleton and/or cellular structures linking focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton .
