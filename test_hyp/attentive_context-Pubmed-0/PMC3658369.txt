the aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between the age of onset of md and the complexity of the personality traits of the patients . moreover , we were interested in identifying an age threshold able to maximize the difference of personality traits between early and later onsets and investigating the association between mood disorder severity and personality traits . to start with , the prevalence of the personality disorders ( pd ) evaluated with the mcmi - iii in patients admitted for a depressive / hypomaniac episode through a dimensional evaluation was higher than that in previous studies , regarding both outpatients with a depression diagnosis and dimensional evaluation   and patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders   .
the main goal of the present study is to evaluate the association between the age of onset of md and the complexity of the personality traits of the patient .
, the results suggest the need to assess maladaptive personality traits not only during adolescence but also in young adults too in order to prevent and treat potentially severe md .
our findings suggest that it is important to design prospective studies able to evaluate the level of comorbidity also on later md onset patients and to include variables about the severity of the disorders . from a clinical point of view
