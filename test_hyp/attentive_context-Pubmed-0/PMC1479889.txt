examples of neurological diseases where aberrant protein 
 aggregates are found , and the suggested conformations in the 
 aberrant aggregates are indicated .
many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by 
 their presence in neural tissue of aberrant protein aggregates 
 ( see table 1 ) . in general , these aggregates arise after the modification of a 
 native protein . that modification could result in a conformational 
 change of the native protein that promotes the aberrant 
 aggregation .
we will mainly focus on those aggregates assembled from tau 
 protein , aggregates that could be present in the neurological 
 disorders known as tauopathies ( for a review see ) ( table 1 ) .
recently , some good reviews have been published on protein 
 aggregation and neurodegenerative disorders   . in this 
 review
the most studied model of this mechanism has been the prion 
 protein where a change from an alpha helix to beta sheet structure 
 facilitates the polymerization of a protein with a different 
 conformation that appears to have a cytotoxic effect . in a similar way
, conformational changes between a native protein 
 and its aberrant protein counterpart with capacity for 
 self - assembly have been studied in many neurodegenerative 
 diseases . among the most common techniques used for these analyses
