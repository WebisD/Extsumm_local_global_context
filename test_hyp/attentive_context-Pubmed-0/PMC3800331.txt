the positive predictive value ( ppv ) for all the tests had been low , but marginally high in the ulbt .
ulbt had the highest specificity and negative predictive value ( npv ) compared with the other tests .
, an attempt is made to compare the diagnostic value of the upper lip bite test ( ulbt ) along with anatomic measurements of lateral neck radiography .
the result of different predictive tests based on laryngoscopic view sensitivity , specificity , ppv and npv of different evaluation tests
this is the first study where in a large sample size was used and which used all clinical , radiologic and airway risk criteria in an attempt to identify factors affecting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation .
ever since banister and macbeth stressed the importance of the position of the head and neck in direct laryngoscopy in order to achieve a proper alignment of the axes of the mouth , pharynx and larynx , many tests and landmarks ( mallampati test , inter - incisor gap ( iig ) , subluxation of the mandible , thyromental distance ( tmd ) , length of mandibular rami , profile classification , chin protrusion , atlanto - occipital extension ) have been introduced to predict an unanticipated difficult airway , but unfortunately these tests are not totally reliable . despite limitations , some tests or combination of tests have been of immense value in predicting unsuspected difficult cases of endotracheal intubations . in the present study
