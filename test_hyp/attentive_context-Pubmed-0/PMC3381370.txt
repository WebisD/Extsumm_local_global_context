empirically described treatment may lead to resolution of clinical symptoms , even though ivermectin is a better treatment for chronic strongyloidiasis .
positive serologic test results , marked eosinophilia , absence of other helminthic infections , compatible clinical signs , and disappearance of symptoms after specific treatment can help establish a vlm diagnosis , especially in areas of low parasitism .
vlm should be included in the differential diagnosis of eosinophilia in immigrants ( children and adults ) from tropical areas if respiratory or abdominal symptoms are evident .
albendazole is an effective and relatively safe drug that could be used to treat suspected vlm and other concomitant nematode infections , including cryptic s. stercoralis threadworm infections .
of these 28 patients , 11 were excluded because of other concomitant parasitic infections that also can cause eosinophilia : 8 patients had positive elisa results for s. stercoralis nematodes ( not detected in fecal samples or larval culture ) ; 1 had ascaris lumbricoides eggs in feces ; 1 had a positive indirect hemagglutination result but negative elisa result for e. granulosus tapeworm ; and 1 had a positive elisa serologic result for t. spiralis nematodes .
clinical toxocariasis is rarely diagnosed in western countries as previously described despite evidence of environmental exposure ( 1 ) .
