restricted - access transmissions , which can be read or copied only with the help of a key , are possible both in principle and in practice using polarized photons .
mathematically , a polarized photon acts like a two - bit read - once memory one of whose bits ( k ) serves as a read key for the other ( m ) . querying the memory with the correct k yields the correct value of m. querying with the wrong k yields a random bit instead of m , and in either case querying resets the memory so that subsequent queries yield no new information .
we thus have a situation in which restricted - access memory , as a storage device , is possible in practice but not in principle via conventional technology , and in principle but not in practice via storage of polarized photons . on the other hand ,
photons can also be stored ( e.g.  between mirrors , or in a closed optical fiber ) , but they can not in practice be stored for very long , and their natural application is in the transmission of information .
analog messages ( e.g.  handwritten signatures ) are somewhat harder to copy , but not really infeasible , and digital data can be protected to a considerable extent by interposing a restrictive hardware interface between the data and the outside world ( e.g.  smart credit cards ) ; but in both these cases , the difficulty of copying is only technological , not fundamental
