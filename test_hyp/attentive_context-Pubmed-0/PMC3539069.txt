one of the explanations for this seems to be that obese women have difficulties to conceive due to irregular periods , rather than increased risk of miscarriages .
however , the increased risk of failing to become pregnant associated with both underweight and obesity was attenuated with the last set of adjustments ( table  2 ) , but even fully adjusted ( line 3 ) , there was a statistically significant ( p  <  0.001 ) u - formed relationship between body mass index at age 20 and problems of becoming pregnant .
there was in addition a seemingly interaction for age at menarche , but the relationships for women with early and late menarche were the same ( p - value for interaction  =  0.9 ) if the two categories of obesity were merged .
the association was the same in women who were lifelong abstainers from alcohol and other women ( p value for interaction  =  0.5 ) and was also found in the 27,891 women who denied ever having used either stimulant ( alcohol and tobacco ) .
