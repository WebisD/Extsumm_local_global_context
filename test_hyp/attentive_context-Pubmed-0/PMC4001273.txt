from the present study , it can be concluded that : 
 irrigation with 5% naocl + 2.25% paa caused the maximum calcium loss from root dentin and minimum microhardness.irrigation with 5% naocl + distilled water caused minimum calcium loss from root dentin and maximum microhardness.a reduction in the microhardness of root dentin was observed with increase in calcium loss from root dentin . 
 
intergroup comparison for calcium loss and microhardness mean calcium loss in naocl + distilled water group ( 2.79  0.97 ppm ) and naocl + qmix group ( 5.72  0.91 ppm ) are least followed by naocl + edta group ( 6.38  1.76 ) and maximum in naocl + paa group ( 9.00  0.55 ppm ) .
therefore , the present study has been undertaken to evaluate the effect of different irrigation regimens on calcium loss and its effect on the micro - hardness of the root dentin .
a reduction in the microhardness of root dentin was observed with increase in calcium loss from root dentin .
the mean dentin microhardness in naocl + distilled water group ( 77.39  2.16 vickers hardness number [ vhn ] ) and naocl + qmix group ( 70.68  4.97 vhn ) were maximum followed by naocl + edta group ( 69.70  4.14 ) and least in naocl + paa group ( 62.98  8.17 vkn ) .
