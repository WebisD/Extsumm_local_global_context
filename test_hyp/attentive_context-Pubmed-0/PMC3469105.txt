our aims in the current study are to : ( 1 ) summarize epidemiological studies of dementia in japan including relevant details of study protocols and diagnostic criteria , ( 2 ) compare age - specific prevalence of all - cause dementia among studies , and ( 3 ) assess the trends in ad versus vad over time .
the hisayama studies which conducted 4 cross - sectional studies using the same diagnostic criteria for subtypes of dementia also showed the increasing trend in the ratio of ad / vad , ranging from 0.52 in 1985 to 1.96 in 1998 , and 1.92 in 2005 . the tajiri project , which conducted an mri substudy to identify dementia etiologies , showed that the proportion of ad among total dementia cases differed largely depending on the criteria used : 62.5% ( ad / vad = 3.3 ) using ninds - airen criteria , and 40.6% ( ad /
the results showed that compared with the all - cause dementia prevalence in 1985 , that of 2005 was higher ( coefficient : 0.32 , 95% ci : 0.010.64 , p = 0.04 ) controlling for sex and age groups ( not shown in table 1 ) .
