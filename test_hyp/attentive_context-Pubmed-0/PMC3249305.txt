using the right brachial and the femoral arteries as routes for arterial access under moderate hypothermia showed satisfactory results when there were lesions which made direct cannulation into the ascending aorta difficult during ascending aorta and aortic arch replacements .
we report our clinical experiences using the ascending aorta and aortic arch replacement with perfusion via the brachial and femoral arteries under moderate hypothermia .
forty - six consecutive patients underwent replacements of the ascending aorta and aortic arch between july 2005 and may 2010 .
we performed ascending aorta replacement in 9 cases ( 25% ) , ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement in 13 cases ( 36% ) , ascending aorta and total arch replacement in 13 cases ( 36% ) , and total aortic arch replacement in 1 case ( 3% ) .
the mean age of the patients was 61.9 years ( 29 to 79 years ) , and 19 were male and 17 were female .
the preoperative diagnoses were acute type a aortic dissection in 31 ( 86% ) patients , and aortic aneurysm without dissection in 5 ( 14% ) patients .
operations which were performed simultaneously were a coronary bypass graft in 3 cases , aortic valve replacement in 2 cases , and aortic root reimplantation in 1 case .
