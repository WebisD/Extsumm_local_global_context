an unusual case of arvc with a long , natural history in a middle - aged woman is presented .
patients with arvc often die at a young age due to the fatal ventricular arrhythmias whereas arvc of an elder person is rare and different from that of young people . in this report ,
since the first description was more than 20 years ago , arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( arvc ) is increasingly recognized from pathology to diagnosis .
a 54-year - old woman was presented with progressive weakness , severe edema , and moderate shortness of breath on exertion for 9 years .
heart failure may be more obvious in elder patients . although arvc is an inherited disease of the heart muscles involving the right ventricle , the left ventricle may be progressively affected thus resulting in a biventricular failure .
arvc is a heart muscle disease which is characterized by prominent , severe ventricular arrhythmias .
heart transplantation is unusual in arvc but it has been performed at the end stage of heart failure . because of cardiac myocyte loss ( fat and fibrous tissue replacement ) in the right ventricle , the patient would benefit when she accepted an operation of heart transplantation , not the tricuspid valve repair for her severe heart failure .
