so , keeping in mind this fact , present study was conducted to analyze the effect of caries on pulpal tissue stained with quinacrine hydrochloride with the application of fluorescent microscope .
sex determination by fluorescent staining of the y chromosome is a reliable technique in teeth with healthy pulp tissue or caries with enamel or upto half way of dentin .
the values obtained were highest for sound teeth with caries in enamel and value decreases with the progression of the caries .
the p value were found to be significant for sound teeth and teeth with caries in enamel and involving less than half the way of dentin , whereas it was non - significant for teeth involved with further caries involvement .
table 1 showed sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and efficiency of each of the five groups .
we also observed the fluorescent spots in females , and the value of the spot increases in female as the caries progresses , thereby giving false positive results in females [ figure 3 ] .
developed a technique using pulpal tissue stained with quinacrine mustard , specific for y chromosome to determine sex of an individual . in literature , there is scarcity of relevant studies that analyzed the effect of caries on viability of pulpal tissue in sex determination .
