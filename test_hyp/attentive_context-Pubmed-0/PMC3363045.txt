now , we report a literature review and our experience of a case with incidentally found mass , who was first judged as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) of the gastric fundus by abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) and endoscopic ultrasonography ( eus ) , but was later confirmed as gossypiboma resulting from retained surgical sponge .
a 78-year - old female visited the hospital for sudden onset epigastric pain which lasted for one day .
as indicated in its name , gossypiboma is an iatrogenic outcome reported on rare occasions in various parts of the body with diverse clinical findings , often mistaken radiologically as a tumor or abscess .
but the resected lesion was found to be a mass resulted from the retained surgical sponge .
gossypiboma refers to a mass resulting from retained cotton , gauze , or sponge accidentally left within the body after surgery .
this lesion was also found on eus as an exophytic hypoechoic mass connected with the fourth layer of the gastric wall and internal irregular hyperechoic spots with posterior acoustic shadowing .
it appeared , from the operative field , that the mass was a foreign body covered by the inflammatory membrane rather than a gist of the gastric fundus .
