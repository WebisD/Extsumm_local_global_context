this study set out to evaluate the effects of mma on osas patients treated with orthognathic surgery ; specifically , its aim was to establish which cephalometric variables can influence changes in respiratory symptoms .
this retrospective study analyzed 15 patients ( 11 males and 4 females ) from an initial pool of 27 patients ( 
 table 1 
 , who had clinical and polysomnographic evidence of moderate ( 1 subject ) or severe ( 14 subjects ) osas and were submitted to orthognathic surgery as detailed in 
 table 2 
 .
in addition , the increase in lsat was found to show a statistically significant correlation both with the amount of maxillary advancement ( p = 0.03 ) and with the amount of mandibular advancement ( p = 0.029 ) . in particular , the results show that for each mm of co - a and co - pog increase there was a 1% increase in lsat .
differences between preoperative and postoperative cephalometric values and means of differences sna = angle between sella , nasion and subspinale point a ; snb = angle between sella , nasion and supramentale point b ; anb = angle between the maxilla and the mandible ; pas = the narrowest distance between the base of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall ; mp - h = distance from the mandibular plane to the most anterior point of the hyoid bone ) ; co - a = amount of the maxillary advancement ; co - pog = amount of the mandibular advancement ; sd = standard deviation .
