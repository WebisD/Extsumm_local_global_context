primary chest wall chondrosarcoma is a relatively rare malignant tumor   . when a patient with a history of long - term asbestos exposure has a pleural tumor with multiple plaques on chest computed tomography ( ct ) , malignant pleural mesothelioma is usually suspected .
a 62-year - old man with a history of long - term asbestos exposure as a construction worker was found to have a chest wall tumor on chest ct and referred to our hospital .
chest ct showed a pleural tumor invading the sixth rib and multiple pleural plaques ( fig .
the chest wall defect was 25  10 cm in size , and chest wall reconstruction was performed with a polypropylene mesh .
additional wide resection of the chest wall was performed , that is , en bloc resection , including the fifth , sixth , and seventh ribs , with a 5-cm safety margin from the tumor along the sixth rib .
microscopic examination revealed a lobulated growth pattern of cartilaginous cells of histological grade 1 ( fig .
our case suggests that it is difficult to diagnose chondrosarcoma in preoperative imaging diagnosis , and wide resection is necessary for curative treatment .
