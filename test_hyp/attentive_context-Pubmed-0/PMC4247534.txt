only a few cases of pulmonary vascular tumors diagnosed using endobronchial ultrasound - guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( ebus - tbna ) have been reported in the literature .
in addition , ebus - tbna may provide an opportunity to identify and sample endovascular abnormalities in the mediastinal and hilar area .
ebus - tbna seems to be a safe , feasible , and minimally invasive tool for the diagnosis of vascular tumors such as metastatic pulmonary artery leiomyosarcoma .
ebus - tbna of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes has proven value in diagnosis and staging for lung cancer .
they frequently present as filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature on computed tomography ( ct ) making it challenging to distinguish between vascular tumor and thrombotic emboli .
although fluorodeoxyglucose - positive emission tomography ( pet ) scan may reportedly help differentiate malignant growth from benign emboli , pet scans are not routinely performed for this purpose . increased uptake on the pet scan increases the malignant suspicion of vascular tumors but in most cases
a 43-year - old white male was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma of proximal left thigh involving femoral vessels 2 years back .
the case reported is a clear example of the challenges in diagnosis of pulmonary artery tumors due to their endovascular location and the potential risk of bleeding .
