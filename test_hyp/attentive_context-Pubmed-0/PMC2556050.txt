in contrast , liew and colleagues 7 found that there was no association detected between scd1 gene ( at the allele , genotype or haplotype level ) and diabetes - related traits including bmi and waist - to - hip ratio in a primary set of 608 diabetic subjects and 600 control subjects as well as in a replicate set of 350 young - onset diabetic patients and 747 controls .
in 1143 elderly swedish men involved in the uppsala longitudinal study of adult men , warensj and colleagues 6 reported that subjects homozygous for the rare alleles of rs10883463 , rs7849 , rs2167444 , and rs508384 had decreased body mass index ( bmi ) and waist circumference and improved insulin sensitivity . in particular , the rare allele of rs7849 demonstrated the strongest effect on both insulin sensitivity ( regression coefficient ( beta)=1.19 , p=0.007 ) and waist circumference ( beta=-4.4 , p=0.028 ) , corresponding to 23% higher insulin sensitivity and 4 cm less waist circumference .
our cross species study using cattle as a model organism confirmed significant associations of scd1 gene with fat metabolism in skeletal muscle , thus supporting the finding reported by warensj and colleagues 6 that the scd1 gene is related to obesity in humans .
