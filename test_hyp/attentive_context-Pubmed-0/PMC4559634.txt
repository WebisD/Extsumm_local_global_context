the present study was conducted to know the prevalence , etiology and common clinical presentations of dermatophytosis involving skin and hair .
dtm is a good screening medium in laboratory diagnosis of dermatophytosis compared to sda with actidione .
a total of 110 samples which included 101 skin samples and 9 hair samples , from clinically suspected to have dermatophytosis were collected .
high incidence of dermatophytic infections was observed in the low socioeconomic group of people ( 67.74% ) .
age- and sex - wise distribution of cases fungal elements by koh mount were observed in 64 ( 58.18% ) and culture was positive in 62 ( 56.36% ) .
dermatophytes grow earlier on dtm compared to sda with actidione . in the present study even though all 62 culture positive samples yielded growth both on sda with actidione and dtm on primary isolation , appearance of growth was earlier on dtm that is , within 10 days ( 90.32% ) compared to sda with actidione ( 8.06% ) .
8.06% of patients were diabetics , 6.45% were anemic , 3.23% of patients had a history of atopy and 1.61% were hiv positive .
