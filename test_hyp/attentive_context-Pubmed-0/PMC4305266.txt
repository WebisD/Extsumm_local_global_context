the greatest risk of severe thrombocytopenia was in patients infected with p. falciparum , either alone or mixed ( or , 5.46.1 ) , accounting for > 40% of observed cases .
similar relationships between the risk of death and severe thrombocytopenia were seen in both children and adults with malaria and in cases of p. falciparum and p. vivax infections .
severe thrombocytopenia was associated with a 2.4-fold greater risk of admission to hospital and a 4.7-fold increased risk of death , rising to 16-fold when both severe anemia and severe thrombocytopenia were present ( table 3 ) .
in contrast , in the current analysis , the risk of severe thrombocytopenia was significantly lower in patients with malaria who had had a prior episode of malaria within the preceding 2 months ( or , 0.8 ) ; this attenuation was most apparent in patients presenting with p. falciparum but not in those presenting with p. vivax monoinfection or without malaria .
prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the prognostic value of using platelet counts in conjunction with hemoglobin concentrations to define medical interventions and to determine the underlying processes by which thrombocytopenia contributes to the pathology of malaria .
