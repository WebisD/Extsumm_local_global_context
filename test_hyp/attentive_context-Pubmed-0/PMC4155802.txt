they are highly resistant to proteolytic degradation and their amphipathic structures can mimic the bactericidal mechanism of amps.3032 currently , different antimicrobial aapeptides have been developed , such as -aapeptides and -aapeptides.33,34 this review aims to describe recent progress in the discovery of peptidomimetics as new generation antimicrobial agents and discusses future directions for antimicrobial peptidomimetics in the emergence of multidrug - resistant bacteria .
the growing resistance of pathogens is one of the biggest public problems worldwide.1 multidrug - resistant bacterial strains can cause severe infections as they are no longer responsive to most conventional antibiotics.2,3 to combat these pathogens , efforts have been extended to develop a new generation of antibiotics .
currently , the main reasons for the limited practical application of amps include their very high susceptibility to proteolytic degradation by microbial enzymes , toxicity due to high amounts of drug needed for therapy , relatively short half - life , and their high production cost.16 the design and synthesis of peptide mimics ( peptidomimetics ) have been developed to mimic the structure , function , and mode of action of host - defense amps , which act on bacterial cell walls or membranes and can potentially circumvent those obstacles .
