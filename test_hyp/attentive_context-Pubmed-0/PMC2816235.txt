an initial study demonstrated an improvement in lung function related to small airway obstruction and a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms and quality of life after a 2-week treatment with mannitol in 38 patients .
methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge is highly sensitive in identifying bronchial hyperreactivity , and a negative test is often used to exclude asthma .
bronchial provocation testing may be employed for a variety of purposes , but it is most commonly used to assess the tendency of the bronchi to narrow in response to exogenous stimuli .
the safety and efficacy of man dry powder inhalation challenge have been established in large phase iii trials involving healthy subjects and patients with asthma   .
testing can be done by direct and indirect challenges using a number of different agents   ( table  1).table  1agents commonly used in bronchial provocation testing indirect challengesdirect challengesadenosine monophosphate ( amp)acetylcholineeucapnic voluntary hyperventilation ( evh)carbacholexercisehistaminehypertonic salinemethacholinemannitolnot yet approved in the us agents commonly used in bronchial provocation testing   not yet approved in the us methacholine aerosol inhalation is the prototype of a direct inhalation challenge .
the most recent indirect challenge is the mannitol ( man ) dry powder challenge , which is available as a standardized test kit in some countries .
