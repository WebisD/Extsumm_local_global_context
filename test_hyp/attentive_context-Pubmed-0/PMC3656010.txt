atp can act as a non - peptide damage - associated molecular pattern ( damp ) release from injured cells and tissues . in this fashion
purinergic receptors are associated with inflammation , with some receptors inhibited either directly ( p2y12 ) or indirectly through the activity of anti - thrombotic , in the case of platelet p2y12 , or anti - inflammatory agents , in the case of the action of statins on monocyte p2x4 .
what are the release machines in leukocytes and do they differ from other cell types ? it is expected that therapeutic intervention in agonist stimulated atp release is a potentially novel route to pharmacological modulation of innate immune responses but also in chronic inflammatory disease where normal inflammatory responses are heighten and act deleteriously .
investigation into how cellular stress stimulates atp release in non - leukocytes suggests roles for connexin and pannexin hemichannels , maxi- and volume - regulated anion channels and efflux through the p2x7 receptor , though release routes and signal transduction mechanism underlying atp release in leukocytes remain poorly defined .
the release of cellular atp is unregulated and released due to cell lysis or puncture .
do release other nucleotides including utp and udp - sugars but our focus here is atp release . mechanisms of atp release during physiological processes remain diverse and controversial .
