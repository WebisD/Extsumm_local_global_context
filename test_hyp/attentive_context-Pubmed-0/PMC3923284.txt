engagement scores for the oncology unit improved from the previous year , and the poqa scores for both the leadership group and the oncology group showed many significant improvements during the time of measurement .
the variables include pre and post training scores on the personal and organizational quality assessment questionnaire ( poqa - r ) , scores on the independently administered oums annual employee engagement survey , and separations from oums as reported by the human resources department as turnover rates .
this was an improvement from a 2009 high of 73% for one of the oncology service lines with a 34% at the time of training , when newly hired people were beginning to leave again , plateauing and even increasing the rate at that time .
the most significant measured result noted after training 90% of the nursing leadership , vice presidents , directors , and managers and 93% of the oncology staff was the continued decline of the turnover rate to < 14% for the overall oncology oums service line within the first year of the program being instituted .
we will use a 5-year longitudinal design with repeated measures to examine the effect of diffusion of the heartmath healthcare program revitalizing care techniques within oums .
