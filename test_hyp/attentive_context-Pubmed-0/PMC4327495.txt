the purposes of this study were : a ) to evaluate interexaminer reliability in caries detection considering different diagnostic thresholds and b ) to indicate , by using kappa statistics , which is the best way of measuring interexaminer agreement during the calibration process in dental caries surveys .
the results of this study showed that the interexaminer reliability and its maintenance for six months were possible , under both caries diagnosis thresholds .
the results of interexaminer reliability considering each tooth individually showed that the main difficulty was related to caries diagnosis in posterior teeth , especially the permanent first molars , for both thresholds with , in general , lower values for the who+il threshold ( tables 3 and 4 ) .
the present study showed , in general , high means of interexaminer reliability for both diagnosis thresholds when considering the entire dentition , the upper / lower jaws and sextants ( tables 1 and 2 ) . on the other hand , lower kappa values
a matter of great concern that can influence the results of epidemiological studies of dental caries is the variation in disease diagnosis between two or more examiners ( interexaminer error ) and for the same examiner in two or more occasions ( intraexaminer error ) .
