under the approval of the seoul national university institutional animal care and use committee ( snuiacuc ) , six partial nephrectomies were performed on bilateral kidneys of a 5-month - old swine that weighed 30 kg .
therefore , many dry and wet laboratory disciplinary efforts are needed to decrease the warm ischemic time and improve this surgical technique .
however , our study suggests that less for partial nephrectomy results in longer ischemic times than for conventional laparoscopic surgeries .
we performed less partial nephrectomy in a porcine model with the objectives of overcoming the technical challenges of less and exploring the feasibility of the procedure from a technical viewpoint .
three operations were done on each kidney by a surgical staff consisting of two urologists with much experience in laparoscopic surgery ( e1 , e2 ) and two less - experienced urologists ( b1 , b2 ) . a 5 mm flexible laparoscope was used for vision , and the choice of articulating needle driver , rigid needle driver , grasper , and dissectors was made according to the preference of each surgeon .
the mean time for partial resection was 3.1 minutes ( range , 2.5 - 3.3 minutes ) , and the mean resection times for the upper and lower pole areas were 3.4 ( range , 3 - 4 ) and 2.8 ( range , 2.5 - 3.3 ) minutes , respectively .
