analysis of the time - dependence of the four ( 2  +  2 ) direct correlation peaks that are observed in the two experiments enables reliable and robust quantification of the interconversion rates between the two species , along with their longitudinal relaxation rates .
we have presented an alternative way of analyzing longitudinal exchange in two - state exchanging systems by recording pairs of two- ( or more ) dimensional spectra with and without frequency - labeling in an indirect dimension .
this approach partly resolves the issue of cross peak overlap and eliminates errors caused by differential line - broadening of the two species , thereby expanding the applicability of longitudinal exchange experiments to systems with additional conformational exchange on the mss time scale . while our approach increases the experimental time by a factor of two , it significantly reduces the number of sources for systematic errors .
we present a simple and robust alternative to the standard setup of multidimensional longitudinal exchange experiments for biomolecules .
, we have used this experimental setup to characterize conformational exchange in a selectively c labeled sample of a bistable dna oligomer .
eliminates systematic errors that can be caused by differential line - broadening and enables reliable quantification of kinetic and relaxation parameters . as an example
