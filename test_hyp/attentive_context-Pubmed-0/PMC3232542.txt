secondly , we will spend some time discussing the unique subtype of congenital heart block , that which occurs in the absence of major structural anomalies and which is associated with maternal autoimmune antibodies .
the definition of congenital heart block for the purposes of this review will be the presence of conduction system disease of any form , which is diagnosed on or before 28 days of life .
the incidence of congenital heart block has been estimated from several studies to be about 1 in 22,000 live births.1 although this is clearly an uncommon disorder , it may be associated with high mortality and morbidity and therefore requires a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis and aggressive therapy when appropriate .
those patients whose congenital heart block is associated with structural heart disease have a higher morbidity and mortality , which is determined more by the underlying structural congenital heart disease than it is by the need for a pacemaker per se .
the commonest forms of congenital heart disease associated with heart block include left atrial isomerism , often with an accompanying atrioventricular septal defect , as well as levo transposition of the great arteries . when diagnosed in the postnatal period ,
