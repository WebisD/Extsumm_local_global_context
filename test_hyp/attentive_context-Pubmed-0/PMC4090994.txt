therefore , we hypothesised that if we administer la and the adjuvants separately , it may minimise the effect of the changes in densities and also hence their actions . thus , in this study we aimed to compare block characteristics , intra - operative haemodynamics and post - operative pain relief in parturients undergoing cs under subarachnoid block ( sab ) , after administering hyperbaric bupivacaine ( hb ) and clonidine as a mixture in single syringe and sequentially in two syringes .
however , we noticed that sequential technique did not increase the level of sedation and incidence of hypotension or bradycardia as compared to the administration of drugs as mixture .
sequential administration of clonidine reduces the time to achieve complete sensory and motor block and significantly prolongs the total duration of analgesia .
the onset time of sensory and motor block and also the highest level of block achieved ( t4 ) were comparable in both groups [ table 2 ] . mean time to reach maximal cephalad sensory block height was significantly less in group b ( 3.21  0.13 min ) than in group m ( 4.43  0.26 min ) and the total duration of analgesia lasted significantly longer in group b ( 474.3  20.79 min ) as compared to group m ( 337  18.22 min ) ( p = 0.000 ) .
