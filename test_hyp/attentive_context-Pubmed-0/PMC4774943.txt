a 41-year old patient was admitted to our emergency unit because of a highly symptomatic attack of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( af ) that a few hours later spontaneously converted into sinus rhythm .
we describe a so far unreported dronedarone effect , namely a significant alteration of both the morphology and the duration of the qrs complex on electrocardiogram ( ecg ) in a 41-year old patient with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
we describe a hitherto unreported dronedarone effect , namely a significant alteration of both the morphology and the duration of the qrs complex on ecg .
dronedarone is a relatively new antiarrhythmic drug and is held to be less proarrhythmic than comparable compounds , although its proarrhythmia potential in humans has not been sufficiently evaluated .
dronedarone is a derivate of the potent antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone that was designed to have less toxic side effects ( 1 ) .
in fact , qt - interval prolongation , increased frequency of ventricular premature beats , and episodes of atrial flutter have all been reported as potentially proarrhythmic side effects of dronedarone ( 2 , 3 ) .
dronedarone is a multichannel blocker exhibiting all of the 4 vaughan williams classes of action ( 4 ) .
