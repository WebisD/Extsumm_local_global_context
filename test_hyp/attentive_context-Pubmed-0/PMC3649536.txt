we report a rather unusual case of metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma masquerading as primary rectal cancer .
so the recognition of this rare entity ( rectal metastasis from primary breast cancer ) is important , as presentation resembles that of primary rectal carcinoma and differentiation is vital as different therapeutic modalities may be appropriate .
the metastatic involvement of gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract is rare and that of the rectum even rarer . even though lobular carcinoma constitutes only 10% of breast cancers , it is the commonest breast cancer metastasizing to the colon and rectum ( 1 ) .
these metastatic lesions can lead to diagnostic challenge for clinicians as they can mimic primary colo - rectal cancer due to the lack of diagnostic signs .
the clinical presentation of metastatic lesion can be non - specific and mimic a primary cancer as in the present case .
even though there are a few case reports of lobular carcinoma metastasizing to the rectum , there are only 3 case reports in the literature of invasive ductal carcinoma metastasizing to the rectum till date ( 3 - 5 ) . as a clinician the main challenge lies in the differentiation of such metastatic lesions from primary colo - rectal cancer as
