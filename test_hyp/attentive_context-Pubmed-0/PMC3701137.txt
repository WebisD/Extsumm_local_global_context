the aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of copper and cadmium under various exposure conditions ( concentration and time ) on hematopoietic potential of common carp head kidney .
the results showed that toxic effects of both metals were persistent and hematopoietic activity reduced after short - term exposures to cadmium and copper did not recover in 4-week post - treatment .
additionally , cellular parameters of hematopoietic tissue : frequency of blast cells and the rate of proliferation and apoptosis are sensitive indicators of sublethal intoxication .
they also showed that low sublethal concentrations of cadmium , and particularly of copper may significantly disturb hematopoietic processes in fish that do not show any other symptoms of intoxication . in conclusion , anemia and immunosuppression often observed in fish intoxicated with copper and cadmium may result from toxic effect of metals on hematopoietic system .
no anemia was observed in peripheral blood or a significant reduction in leukocyte count , and the most pronounced effect of metal exposures was significantly reduced frequency of peripheral phagocytes ( neutrophils and monocytes ) , accompanied by reduction in their metabolic activity ( kondera and witeska 2012 , and unpublished data of the same study ) .
