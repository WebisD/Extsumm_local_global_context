the focus of this case report is to describe long - term neurocognitive changes in a young female with hurler - scheie syndrome that was treated using enzyme replacement therapy . to our knowledge , this is the first longitudinal case report of a patient receiving enzyme replacement therapy for hurler - scheie syndrome .
thus , we are in a position to begin documenting both the physiological and neurocognitive effects of these new treatments .
this case represents a unique opportunity to study a genetic disorder with neurocognitive effects , in the light of apparently strong biological and environmental protective factors .
the lack of continued neurocognitive decline from age 1311 to age 150 may be attributable to ( 1 ) the milder form of mps with which alpha was diagnosed , ( 2 ) the newer treatments initiated by the team of physicians ( jm ) , ( 3 ) the fact that alpha probably began life with a higher - than - average neurocognitive capacity , or ( 4 ) the supportive and appropriately challenging environment of social support that alpha enjoyed .
, we have the opportunity to follow a young lady with hurler - scheie syndrome over the course of 10 years , documenting the quantity and quality of neurocognitive effects associated with this disease .
