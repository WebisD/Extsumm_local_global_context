no overall time period effect emerged ( f = 0.33 , df = 2 , 34.8 , p = 0.72 ) and no treatment group  time interaction effect was found ( f = 0.20 , df = 2 , 34.8 , p = 0.81 ) ( table 1 ) .
after adjusting for baseline a1c , the pattern of omnibus least squares ( ls ) mean a1c values differed between groups ( f = 4.84 , df = 1 , 42.1 , p = 0.03 ) over the 6 months of follow - up ; the sde group had lower a1c ( least squares mean 10.31 , se 0.32 ) than the mi group ( least squares mean 11.35 , se 0.34 ) ( d = 0.66 , medium effect size ) .
perhaps the educators in the mi group were not proficient in mi compared with other studies ( 1113 ) , but the miti demonstrated good fidelity of our intervention to mi principles . in conclusion , brief motivational interviewing - based counseling with no pre - established level of educational content does not lead to improved metabolic control , whereas ongoing education is important for teens with poorly controlled diabetes .
