the purpose of this study was to determine and compare the prevalence of c. parvum infection in children with an acute or persistent diarrhea in isfahan city , central iran .
cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 12.5% ( 23/184 ) of the children with persistent compared to 1.2% ( 5/422 ) of the children with acute diarrhea ; p<0.001 .
this cross - sectional study was prospectively conducted in three university hospitals in isfahan from august 2007 to june 2008 .
acute or persistent diarrhea was present in 422 ( 69.6% ) and 184 ( 30.4% ) of the children , respectively .
comparison of infected and non - infected children the age difference between children with acute and persistent diarrhea was not statistically significant ( 43.933.4 vs 38.919.6 months , p=0.06 ) and there was no significant difference between the two sexes ( 248/174 vs 104/80 female / male ratio , p=0.6 ) .
the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in children presenting with persistent diarrhea is considerable and we suggest routine stool examination for cryptosporidium in these children for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent possible complications .
most ( 89.2% ) of the infected children were under 5 years of age , however , the age difference between the infected and non - infected children was not statistically significant ; p=0.1 . also , there was no significant sex difference between the infected and non - infected children ; p=0.5 ( table 1 ) .
