differences between groups were evaluated by independent t- test/ sfa : saturated fatty acid , mufa : monounsaturated fatty acid , pufa : polyunsaturated fatty acid as shown in table 3 , there was no significant difference in serum glucose , tac , mda and homa - ir between two groups before the intervention . however , after 8 weeks of rj supplementation , serum tac ( p=0.016 ) increased compared with the initial values and serum glucose ( p=0.006 ) and homa - ir ( p = 0.015 ) decreased at the end of study in rj group compared with placebo .
so , administration of rj in diseases accompanied with oxidative stress history may be useful .
