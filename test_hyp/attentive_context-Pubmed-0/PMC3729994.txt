a 37-year - old female patient presented with chronic epigastric pain lasting 6 months , food phobia and weight loss of 10 kg during the previous 4 months .
we would like to report a case of surgical treatment of mals describing its clinical features , characteristic findings of diagnostic imaging study , and details of our surgical procedure .
median arcuate ligament syndrome ( mals , also called celiac axis compression syndrome or dunbar syndrome ) is known to be caused by compression of celiac artery ( ca ) by a fibrous arch that originates from the diaphragmatic crura on either side of the aortic hiatus and passes superior to the origin of the celiac axis . though it is still debated whether the compression of the ca can cause chronic mesenteric ischemia or not , there have been anecdotal case reports of surgical decompression of ca by dividing the medial arcuate ligament ( mal ) .
while open surgical release of mal has been used for the treatment of this syndrome , laparoscopic release has been reported recently .
this is probably due to the extraluminal compression by mal , which should be solved outside of the ca . in cases of recurrent symptom after surgical decompression of ca , angioplasty is beneficial .
