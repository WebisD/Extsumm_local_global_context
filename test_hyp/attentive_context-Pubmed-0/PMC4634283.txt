molecular assays for detection of this virus have been few and essentially based on endpoint or twostep realtime reversetranscriptase pcr ( rt rtpcr).21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 here , we report on the development of a onestep rt rtpcr assay and its application to the detection of influenza c in a selected panel of respiratory samples .
in this study , we report the detection of influenza c in respiratory samples from alberta , canada . there have been no other reports of the occurrence of this virus in canada ; however , detection in respiratory samples has been previously reported from different countries.1 , 5 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 28 the prevalence of antibodies to influenza c has been shown to range from 60 to 100%.1 , 15 , 16 influenza c has been shown to cause a spectrum of symptoms2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , suggesting that diagnosis of influenza c should be considered in the range of viral etiologies that cause respiratory illness . as a preliminary study ,
recent studies32 show that human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus in this group of patients have a significantly higher rate of mortality , and defining the frequency and outcome of influenza c infections in this group of patients is worthy of study . in our study
