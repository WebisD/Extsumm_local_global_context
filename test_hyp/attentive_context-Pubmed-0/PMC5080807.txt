therefore , the current study was conducted to evaluate whether molecular subtypes can identify patients at high risk for ibtr and lrr following nac and bct .
in conclusion , we demonstrated that the tn and her2 subtypes predicted higher rates of ibtr and lrr after nac followed by bct . among the non - tn
the factors affecting ibtr development included the tn subtype ( p < 0.01 ) , poorly differentiated tumors ( p=0.03 ) , and clinical t3 - 4 stage ( p < 0.01 ) .
clinicians should consider these features for proper assessment of the relevant evidence and decide on an appropriate therapeutic course of action . in a series of women with clinical stage ii - iii breast cancer who underwent nac and bct
, we noted a difference ( p < 0.01 ) in pcr rates with a lower percentage of patients in the luminal a ( 10.6% ) and b1 ( 6.1% ) subgroups compared with patients in the her2(t ) ( 35.5% ) , and tn ( 23.0% ) subgroups .
taken together , a novel locoregional treatment strategy to decrease ibtr and lrr such as mastectomy instead of bct in tn subtype patients with non - pcr to nac deserves further investigation .
