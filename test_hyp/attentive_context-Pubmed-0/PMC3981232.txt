a 78-year old male with past medical history significant for chronic shortness of breath ( for the last two years ) , chronic systolic heart failure secondary to non - ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy , pulmonary hypertension , essential hypertension , coal miner s pneumoconiosis , and chronic obstructive lung disease was found to have bilateral pulmonary nodules on pre - operative chest x - ray .
however , patients do not always present with the triad and a high index of clinical suspicion is needed in order to make a prompt diagnosis .
when patients present with limited disease , without renal involvement , diagnosis is delayed and immunosuppressive treatment is not recommended .
kidney involvement manifests as acute renal failure with red cells , red cell casts and proteinuria .
c - anca is present in 50% of patients with the limited form and 80% of patients with the systemic form of the disease .
the disease has variable presentation and diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical , laboratory , pathologic and imaging studies .
our case demonstrates that limited wg can evolve into systemic disease secondary to environmental triggers such as infection .
the patient s condition rapidly transformed from a limited form to a systemic form of wg in the course of two weeks .
