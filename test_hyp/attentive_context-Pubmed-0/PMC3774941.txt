group a ( control ) , group b ( sodium hypochlorite ) and group c ( sodium perborate ) comprising of 40 specimens each ( fig .
this study was aimed to determine the effect of two chemically distinct denture cleansers and water on the surface hardness of acrylic and silicone based soft denture liners at various time intervals .
silicone - based soft liners showed better compatibility with cleansing solutions and maintained their resiliency better thereby , proving to be more promising for long term usage .
each group was divided further into 4 subgroups : subgroup i , ii , iii and iv ( consisted of 10 specimens each ) to be tested at a time interval of 1 week , 1 month , 3 months and 6 months respectively .
hypochlorite group , differences in mean values were insignificant between 1 week and 1 month , and 1 month and 3 months .
after 1 month highly significant changes were noted in surface hardness for acrylic samples when mean values for control group are compared to those of sodium hypochlorite group and sodium perborate group .
comparative evaluation between silicone and acrylic samples revealed insignificant differences in mean values for surface hardness of acrylic - based and silicone - based soft denture liners in control group at 1 week . at 3 months and at 6 months
