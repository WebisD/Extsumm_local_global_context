ganglioside may influence growth and cell - to - cell interactions may be of importance in the development of malignancy . in the present study , we used a transplantable murine hepatoma as the experimental model , and treated the animals with 5-fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) as the active therapeutic drug to determine the membrane glycolipids content variety .
ganglioside content in hepatoma tissue was significantly different among the 3 groups ( p<0.01 ) , and those in the therapeutic group were significantly lower than in the control group ( p<0.01 ) . in the plasma of the hepatoma mice ,
in evaluating the ability of antimetabolic drug 5-fu to inhibit tumor growth , we found that the weight of tumors was significantly different between the 2 groups ( p<0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .
the tsa and lsa contents in the plasma of the hepatoma mice were higher in the control group than in the therapeutic and normal groups ( p<0.05 ) .
the biochemistry index of membrane glycolipids may be considered as an ancillary indicator for judging therapy effect in transplanted hepatomas in mice .
therapeutic group , control group and normal group membrane content variety the ganglioside content in hepatoma tissue from the control group was significantly higher than that in normal mouse liver ( p<0.01 ) , whereas those in the therapeutic group was significantly lower than in the control group ( p<0.01 ) . in the plasma of the hepatoma mouse ,
