 we present our experience in the management of cases of syringomyelia due to dorsal spinal arachnoid bands and review the current available evidence of the diagnostic work - up and management of this etiology .
there are very few reports in the literature describing arachnoid bands / webs as causes of  idiopathic syringomyelia .
syringomyelia is the development of a fluid - filled cavity within the spinal cord . despite different etiologies that cause syringomyelia
a 43-year - old male was referred with a 2-year history of progressive dissociative sensory loss in his lower limbs with myoclonic twitches .
we report a very uncommon and hence under - recognized cause of symptomatic syringomyelia . whilst arachnoid bands / webs have previously been reported as the etiologic factor for idiopathic syringomyelia
known causes of syringomyelia include chiari 1 malformation and basal arachnoiditis [ postinfectious , inflammatory , postirradiation , blood in subarachnoid space ( sas ) amongst others ] . primary spinal syringomyelia refers to syrinx formation due to a spinal pathology , e.g. , spinal cord tumor , spinal infection , trauma , and surgery . the term  idiopathic syringomyelia  has been used to describe syrinx formation in cases where causative mechanism remains undetermined after clinical and routine radiological work - up .
