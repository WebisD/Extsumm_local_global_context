the induced toxicity was more pronounced in case of tga - qd exposure , rather than gsh - qd , as shown by the dose responses curves . by treating the animals with sublethal doses of qds , both regeneration assay and population growth rate were affected by tga- and not gsh - capped qd , suggesting either an increased subcellular stability of gsh - qds or a protective role played by gsh against potential cd - induced ros productions . as nanoparticles may enter natural waters through sewage effluent and landfill leakages and present unknown risk to aquatic species including freshwater invertebrates , we recommend that invertebrate testing is used not only to advance the level of knowledge in nanoecotoxicology but also for investigating the   behaviour and bioavailability of engineered nanoparticles in the aquatic environment through standardized tests . in conclusion , we suggest that our simple model system , up to now used mainly by a niche of biologists to study developmental and regeneration processes , has great potential to inspire many scientists working in the   field of nanoscience , from chemists to toxicologists demanding new models to study the impact of nanoparticles on living organisms and their environment and to investigate the molecular basis of the bio - nonbio interactions .
