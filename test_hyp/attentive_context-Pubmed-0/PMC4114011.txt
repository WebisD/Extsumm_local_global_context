the objective of this trial was to compare the effectiveness of two oral hygiene aids : chewing stick and manual toothbrush , for plaque removal and gingival health after one month of a randomized clinical trial .
chewing sticks ( miswak ) has revealed parallel and at times greater mechanical and chemical cleansing of oral tissues as compared to a toothbrush .
therefore , it is suggested that advocacy may be planned to amplify the use of chewing sticks on the evidence of the current trial especially in the developing countries with financial limitations and restricted oral health care services for general population .
comparison of mean plaque and mean gingival scores between the two interventional groups at pre- and post - examination phases
group a participants were provided with the new , soft textured , nylon manual toothbrushes while members of group b were given new fresh chewing stick of neem tree measuring 20 cm ( length )  20 mm ( diameter ) . before the commencement of study
the same table illustrates the paired t - test values which imply comparative ( pre and post intervention ) differences in plaque and gingival mean scores within chewing stick users , as well as within toothbrush users .
