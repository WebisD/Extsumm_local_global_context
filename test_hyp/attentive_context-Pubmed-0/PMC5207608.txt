the majority of fully regressed tumors after turning off the expression of transgene by withdrawing doxycycline from the drinking water will reoccur in the original tumor site as transgene expression - independent.7,8,17 by analyzing these recurrent tumors , we can understand the molecular basis of how tumor cells escape from their dependence on doxycycline - induced transgene expression.1719 therefore , inducible mouse models enable us to extrapolate the collected in vivo data to predict therapeutic responses in clinical settings and develop new therapeutic strategies against recurrent tumors . in this review , we will highlight the importance of inducible mouse models in studying target validation and tumor recurrence by citing several previously developed inducible mouse models as examples .
given that tumor recurrence is always a concern in cancer therapy , understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance of tumor cells is critical for developing new therapeutic strategies against recurrent tumors .
the ultimate goal of cancer research is to develop therapeutic strategies against primary tumors and recurrent tumors through the study of target validation and tumor recurrence .
if the driver mutations are not required for tumor maintenance , those gene products can not serve as anticancer drug targets.7,8 techniques used to assess whether the identified gene is associated with tumor maintenance in in vitro culture systems , include sirna - mediated gene expression knockdown or small chemical compound - mediated gene product activity inhibition.9 if these techniques abrogate gene product role in tumor cell growth , the gene may be required for tumor cell growth and therefore serves as a possible drug target for the inhibition of tumor growth.1013 several in vivo mouse systems have been used to verify these in vitro results . in particular ,
