there are many obstacles encountered to the in vivo application of targeted magnetic io nanoparticles for tumor imaging , including heterogeneous expression levels of the targeted receptor in human tumor cells , various physiological barriers preventing the nanoparticle from reaching the targeted cells , and a lack of information on the intratumoral distribution and imaging capability of targeted nanoparticles within tumor sites that are relevant to the locations of most human primary and metastatic tumors . for tumor - targeted therapy , methods to increase the loading capacity of anticancer drugs in the nanoparticles and control their release at target cells remain quite challenging .
although recent advances have demonstrated the feasibility of using targeted magnetic io nanoparticles for tumor imaging and therapy , methods and strategies to produce tumor - targeted imaging probes with a high specificity and sensitivity are still greatly needed .
we focus on recent advances in the development of targeted io nanoparticles for tumor imaging and therapy .
the development of novel approaches for early detection and cancer marker - specific and personalized treatment of cancers is urgently needed to increase patient survival .
in addition , numerous obstacles are faced in developing cancer - specific imaging agents , such as 1 ) delivery of the probe to the targeted tissue / tumor ; 2 ) biocompatibility and toxicity ; 3 ) stability of the probe and effective signal enhancement in vivo ; 4 ) adequate imaging methods and strategies . during chemotherapy ,
