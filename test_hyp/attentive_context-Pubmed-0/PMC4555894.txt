the penile horn continues to fascinate the dermatologists and surgeons alike because of the morphological appearance and presentation .
the term  cutaneous horn  is a morphologic designation referring to unusually cohesive keratinized material and not a true pathologic diagnosis .
the earliest documented case of cutaneous horn , or cornu cutaneum , was that of an elderly welsh woman in london who was displayed commercially as an anomaly of nature in 1588 .
cutaneous horns have been a subject of curiosities and controversies . in the late eighteenth century , the london surgeons everard home and his brother - in - law john hunter are generally credited with the characterization of cutaneous horns as a medical disorder . though cutaneous horn has been described at various sites , horn over the penis is very rare and represents the most unusual site .
cutaneous horn ( synonyms ; cornu cutaneum : cornu humanum ) is a conical , hyperkeratotic protrusion that often resembles an animal horn .
the penile horn is only a morphological entity and the true pathology masked by it .
the first case report of a penile horn was published as early as 1854 . since
then there has been sporadic reporting of cases by dermatologists , surgeons and urologists mainly for curiosity and various conditions which may present as a penile horn .
