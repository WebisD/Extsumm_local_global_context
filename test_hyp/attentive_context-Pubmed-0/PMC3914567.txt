these data support the hypothesis that awareness for different domains , specifically awareness of function , memory , and balance , would differentially relate to clinical correlates .
this was most evident in the clinical correlates for the ad group versus the non - ad and amci groups for awareness of memory . here , the relationship between specific symptoms of depression and awareness of memory was only evident for the ad group .
this is in keeping with early work on awareness demonstrating differential clinical correlates for specific awareness domains   and provides support for the assertion by markova and colleagues   that awareness must be conceptualized as specific to the domain being measured , and that research on one domain can not be generalized to another domain .
a secondary purpose of this paper is to contrast awareness for balance , function , and memory for those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) .
awareness of function was lower for the groups diagnosed with dementia than those with mci whereas awareness of memory was lower for the group with ad dementia and the group with amci , often considered a precursor to ad , than for the non - ad dementia or non - amci groups .
