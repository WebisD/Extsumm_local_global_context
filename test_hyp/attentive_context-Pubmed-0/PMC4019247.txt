the present study showed that alterations in hba1c level on administration of dpp4 inhibitors as monotherapy are associated with estimated intake of fish , estimated intake of dietary n3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( pufa ) , and serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) .
we find that changes of hba1c levels on administration of dpp4 inhibitors are associated with estimated intake of fish and estimated intake of dietary n3 pufa , as well as serum epa and dha levels . despite being a retrospective cohort study with a limited sample size ,
we find that the reduction of hba1c by dpp4 inhibitors significantly correlates with estimated intake of fish , estimated intake of epa and dha , and serum levels of epa and dha .

in the present study , dpp4 inhibitors , similarly to previous reports , significantly reduced hba1c levels , but not bodyweight ( before initiation of dpp4 inhibitors 7.2    0.7% ; 4  months after initiation of dpp4 inhibitors 6.7    0.6% [ paired ttest , p  <  0.01 vs before ] ) .
