frommel et al.3 suggested that fasting in healthy lean individuals was well tolerated until 18% of body mass was lost ; the patient reported here lost 20.7% of body mass without substantial loss of function .
one prior report of long - term fasting in obese individuals for 3040 days demonstrated body mass losses between 10.6% and 20.5% , but does not report on function of individuals.4 it seems self - apparent and supported by this limited evidence , such that the starting mass is a key variable in survival of extreme fasting , and not the amount of loss .
it is noteworthy , therefore , in this case study that moderate physical function appears maintained at day 49 , as assessed by general observation and results of the six - minute walk test .
current world medical association guidelines prioritize autonomy , recommending nonintervention in fasting to the point of harm and/or death , if the patient makes a written informed statement of intent.5 lack of research into this field precludes evidence - based decision - making or advice . in the limited light of this case study and historic data of fasting in obesity,4
a 34year - old male presented for general examination on day 49 of a 50-day self - imposed fast , seeking approval to continue his fasting behavior . during this period ,
