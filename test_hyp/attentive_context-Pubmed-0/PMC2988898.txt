we present an unusual case of small bowel neuroendocrine malignant tumor diagnosed by double - balloon enteroscopy ( dbe ) .
a 36-year - old man with weight loss presented with a 1-year history of distention , abdominal pain and macies .
the capsule was stuck in the jejunum stricture and was removed with a snare under dbe .
small bowel stenosis often leads to capsule retention . in this patient , we shared an examination process of a rare case of neuroendocrine malignant tumor in the small bowel .
the incidence of neuroendocrine tumors is increasing ( approximately 6% per year ) , but clinical presentation is nonspecific , resulting in delays in diagnosis ( 5 - 7 years ; approximately 70% have metastases ) .
neuroendocrine tumors usually exist at the lung , stomach and colon , but the small bowel is a rare location .
when the scope passed 20 cm from the treitz ligament we found jejunum erosion , nodal hyperplasia , stenosis ( fig .
capsule endoscopy found segmental distribution of ulceration , erosion and nodal hyperplasia in the proximate jejunum consistent with crohn 's disease ( fig .
the dbe was inserted again for biopsy , and some specimen were retrieved . the next day , barium examination revealed that the stenosis was near to the treitz ligament ( fig .
