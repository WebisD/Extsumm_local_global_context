the role of autophagy in diseases is an emerging area of investigation , with recent studies indicating that autophagy may exert multifunctional roles in specific diseases , with the potential for both adaptive and harmful outcomes .
the role of autophagy in diseases is an emerging area of investigation , with recent studies indicating that autophagy may exert multifunctional roles in specific diseases , with the potential for both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes .
furthermore , deficiency or absence in autophagic function may play a pathogenic role in select human diseases   .
recent studies have also examined potential cross - talk between the signaling pathways that regulate autophagy and those that regulate distinct forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis .
additional studies are needed to define the dynamic equilibrium between autophagy , apoptosis , regulated necrosis , and other modes of cell death in the context of human disease pathogenesis .
furthermore , deficiency or absence in autophagic function may also contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases   .
furthermore , there is considerable cross - talk between the molecular regulation of autophagy and other regulated forms of cell death   .
furthermore , autophagy plays a vital role in innate and adaptive immune mechanisms , including resistance to pathogen infections   .
