hence , we undertook this study with an aim to ascertain current awareness among the medical students and residents ( the future practitioners ) about the surgical procedures that a plastic surgeon performs .
spending hours in plastic surgery opd in a government medical college and dealing with the kind of queries posed to us by patients and often having to see delayed and neglected patients made us question and wonder on various views that people have of plastic surgery .
it was observed [ table 1 ] that there was a good deal of awareness ( > 60% ) regarding the role of plastic surgeons in dealing with burn injuries , rhinoplasty , liposuction , hair grafting and cleft lip and palate .
most of the patients had no idea of the range of our services and had reached us after having visited a series of generalists and eventually being referred to us .
the y - axis reveals percentage of referral to plastic surgeons and x - axis shows the group studied .
there was a moderate degree of awareness ( 4060% ) regarding wound management and pressure ulcer , being managed by plastic surgeons .
the best way to describe plastic surgeons is that we are a problem solving specialty .
