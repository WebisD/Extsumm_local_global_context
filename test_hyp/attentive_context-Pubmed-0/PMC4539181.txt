this study aimed to investigate the impact of ficolin b ( the orthologue to human m - ficolin ) on the development of diabetic nephropathy in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes .
in conclusion , this study demonstrates that ficolin b does not modify the kidney weight and acr in a type 1 diabetes mouse model .
this indicates that the role of the lectin pathway in the development of diabetic nephropathy is specific and that hyperglycaemia - induced glycations on renal cells may be more prone to bind mbl than ficolin b.
we are the first to investigate the role of ficolin b ( which corresponds to ficolin m in human ) in the inflammatory response of diabetic nephropathy . in mice with deficiency of mbl ,
in the present study we found no association between diabetes - induced kidney changes and the presence of ficolin b. we conclude that ficolin b is not responsible for , or a crucial contributory factor in , the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy . in our study , the kidney weight and to some extent the acr were altered by diabetes as expected .
the diabetes - induced increase in kidney weight , measured by comparing the diabetic mice with the nondiabetic mice , was not statistically different between the wild - type and ficolin b knockout mice .
