we report a rare case of accumulation of bone scintigraphy tracer in a phlebolith in a patient of adenocarcinoma of lung .
a 43-year - old female patient , known case of adenocarcinoma of right lung was referred for a tc - mdp bone scan with complaint of persistent low backache since 3 months .
tc - methylene diphosphonate ( tc - mdp ) imaging , customarily directed toward identifying altered skeletal metabolism , has been used extensively to image a variety of extraosseous lesions , especially heterotopic ossification and metabolic , metastatic calcification .
bone scintigraphy is an important modality for the examination of various pathological conditions of the skeletal system .
planar bone scan ( a and b ) of a 43-year - old female patient , a known case of adenocarcinoma of right lung .
radionuclide bone imaging is quick , relatively inexpensive , widely available , and exquisitely sensitive and is invaluable in the diagnostic evaluation of numerous pathological conditions .
, we report a rare case of extraosseous uptake of bone scan tracer in a phlebolith . with growing use of integration of ct with spect
these compounds accumulate rapidly in bone , and by 2 - 6 h after injection , about 50% of the injected dose is in the skeletal system .
