constraint - induced movement therapy ( cimt ) is one of the treatment strategies which utilizes the principles of neural plasticity to help acquire motor skills of the affected upper extremity.  this therapeutic approach involves constraining of the unaffected upper extremity using sling , plaster cast , mitt or splints and intensive training of the affected upper extremity with task - specific , goal - oriented activities by reinforcement ( shaping technique ) .
the observation of this case report indicates that the use of cimt could reverse the learned non - use phenomenon of the affected upper extremity in infantile hemiplegia and thus reduce disability to greater extent .
the potential use of the affected upper extremity of children with hemiplegia often fails due to  learned non - use phenomenon  .
were observed at the end of two weeks and three weeks respectively which should be attributed to the improvements in the quality of motor skills of the affected right upper extremity .
a five - year - old female child presented with right hemiplegia with the history of delayed motor milestones and limited motor skills of the right upper extremity since birth .
the quality of upper extremity skills test ( quest ) is a criterion - referenced measure that evaluates the quality of upper extremity function in four domains : dissociated movements ( 19 items with one level of response for each item ) , grasps ( six items with three to five levels of response for each item ) , weight - bearing ( five items with six levels of response for each item ) and protective extension ( three items with six levels of response for each item ) .
