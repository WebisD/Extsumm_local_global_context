optical buffers are recognized as essential components in wavelength routers , in which the packets of data can be stored for resolving packet contention problems and also delay the outgoing packets.1,2 in practice , the optical router patents have been proposed and recorded,35 which can be useful for various applications .
, we have shown that the use of a transceiver for long distance microscopic volume by using the proposed system , in which the drug delivery or molecular communication can be performed via the wavelength router to the required ( connecting ) targets . however , the problems of large microscopic volume and neutral matter may cause a problem , in which the pursuit of new guide pipes and media,27 for instance , nano tubes and specific gases , will be the issue of investigation .
recently , the promising techniques of microscopic volume trapping and transportation within the add / drop multiplexer have been reported in both theory6 and experiment,7 respectively , in which the transporter is known as an optical tweezer . here , the optical tweezer generation technique has become a powerful tool for the manipulation of micrometer - sized particles . to date
moreover , the use of dynamic tweezers is now also understood in practical works.810 schulz et al11 have shown that the transfer of trapped atoms between two optical potentials can be performed . in principle , optical tweezers use forces exerted by intensity gradients in the strongly focused beams of light to trap and move the microscopic volumes of matters , in which the other combination of force is induced by the interaction between photons , which is caused by photon scattering effects . in application , the field intensity can be adjusted and tuned , in which the desired gradient field and scattering force can form the suitable trapping force . hence , the appropriate force can be configured for the transmitter / receiver , which can perform the long distance microscopic transportation . in this paper , dynamic optical tweezers / vortices
