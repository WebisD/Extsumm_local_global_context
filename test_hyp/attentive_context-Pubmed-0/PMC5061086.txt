the national research center for cardiac surgery ( nrccs ) , located in astana , kazakhstan , established a mechanical circulatory support programme in 2011.with the help of experienced european centres , the nrccs established the sole vad programme in kazakhstan providing vad support to all regions of this , the world 's ninth largest country .
this was a retrospective , observational study of patients who received lvad implantation from the start of the programme in november 2011 to november 2014 and the last date of follow up was 28 february 2015 .
this report describes the logistics and clinical results for the first three years of the programme .
in addition , remote monitoring of lvad patients is a unique challenge we face because of the large distances between our centre and our patients .
we implant earlier in patients because of the low likelihood of heart transplant , the large distances between our centre and many of our patients , and to prevent right ventricular failure .
strong governmental support has been a key factor in the initiation and development of our programme . by adopting new technologies and applying the results of our data we aim to reduce adverse events and improve outcomes in our patients .
