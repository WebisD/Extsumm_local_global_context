, we aimed to evaluate the usefulness of pct and crp as early diagnostic markers of bacteremia in cancer patients with chemotherapy - related fn in the ed .
these findings suggest that pct is a useful early diagnostic marker to detect bacteremia in cancer patients with fn and has better diagnostic value than crp . it is recommended to establish an early treatment strategy to prevent complications of bacterial infection in fn patients with high serum pct concentration in the ed .
pct and crp have been considered useful . in previous reports on pct and crp ,
the bacteremia group showed significantly higher rates of pulse ( 115 beats / min vs. 108 beats / min , p=0.01 ) and respiration ( 22 breaths / min vs. 20 breaths / min , p < 0.01 ) than the non - bacteremia group whereas sbp ( 114 mm hg vs. 117 mm hg ) and body temperature ( 38.5 vs. 38.4 ) were not significantly different between the two groups ( p>0.05 , each ) .
in the same way , pct and crp showed much higher levels in the bacteremia group compared to the non - bacteremia group ( the median value of pct , 2.75 ng / ml vs. 0.00 ng / ml , p<0.01 ; the median value of crp , 15.9 mg / dl vs. 5.6 mg / dl , p<0.01 ) .
