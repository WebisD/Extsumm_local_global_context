this paper will describe the incidence of gastric metaplasia in duodenum in various gastroduodenal diseases and discuss the pathogenetic role of gastric metaplasia in peptic ulcer .
the study could be expanded to clarify possible relations between acid secretion , stage of peptic ulcer , and stomach cancer .
the authors obtained two or three pieces of random biopsy specimens from apparently normal mucosa in the anterior wall of duodenal bulb using gastroduodenal fiberscope on 65 subjects .
the gastric ulcer group consisted solely of patients with ulcers located at the body , angle , or proximal antrum : two of the subjects in this group were additionally diagnosed with duodenitis . the incidence of gastric metaplasia according to its underlying diseases
extensive use of gastroduodenal fibroscopy enabled the authors to obtain biopsies of the duodenal mucosa .
historically , presence of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the intestinal tract has never aroused particular interest among clinicians .
three of 7 patients with duodenitis ( 42.8% ) , and one of 8 patients with gastric erosions ( 12.5% ) , had gastric metaplasia . the incidence of gastric metaplasia in the patients with gastic ulcer seemed to be varied according to the location of ulcer . although the number of cases was too low to evaluate it more thoroughly , the incidence of metaplasia was higher ( 66.7% ) in the patients with ulcers located in lower portion of the stomach ( prepyloric and pyloric ) than ulcers located in lower portion of the stomach ( prepyloric and pyloric ) than ulcers located in upper portion of the stomach ( 57.1% in those with ulcers located in angle and proximal antrum : 0% in those with body ulcer ) .
