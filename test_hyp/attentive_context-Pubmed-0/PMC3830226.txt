the purpose of the study was to compare the histopathological features with pcr method to predict the presence of hpv infection in oscc biopsies as the detection of hpv in patients of oscc may be of great help in planning targeted therapy and for better prognostication .
application of fischer 's exact test ( two tailed ) when fischer 's exact test ( two tailed ) was applied for evaluating the difference in the presence of koilocytes it showed that there was a significant difference in the number of koilocytes in hpv positive and negative cases for hpv16 , hpv 18 and combined hpv 16 and 18 .
however , features such as invasion and abnormal alteration in collagen can not be used as predictors for hpv status . therefore , for economically poor patients of oscc , indirect determination of the hpv status using koilocytosis and dyskeratosis as indicators , may eliminate the need for more expensive hpv tests using pcr , as hpv - positive patients are reported to have better prognosis than hpv - negative cases .
the other two histological features of invasion and abnormal alteration in collagen showed no significant difference between hpv positive and negative cases hpv16 , hpv18 , and combined hpv 16 18 .
