in conclusion , in this article we described a case of appendiceal perforation leading to retroperitoneal abscess formation as a complication of percutaneous rfa of an srm .
, we describe the first case of appendiceal perforation as a complication of ct - guided percutaneous rfa of an smr .
although rfa of srm is generally a minimally invasive and safe procedure , one should be aware of the possibility of particular minor and major complications when performing this innovative and promising procedure .
due to the widespread use of imaging modalities , such as ultrasonography , computed tomography ( ct ) , and magnetic resonance imaging , the incidences of incidentally found small cortical renal masses ( srms ) and renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) , have increased during the past years . for decades , the standard therapy for patients with clinically suspected rcc consisted of radical nephrectomy , an invasive surgical procedure with high morbidity .
if vital structures remain in close vicinity of the ablative field , one should consider treatment options other than rfa .
the reported incidence of bowel perforation complicating renal rfa therefore ranges from 0 to 8.3%   . in this article
