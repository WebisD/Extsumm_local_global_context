thus far , the therapeutic potentials of mscs have primarily been supported by preclinical evidence and the need for clinical trials has been suggested ( 4 ) . as there is a lack of clinical data , we here introduce a patient who was treated with mscs in the course of ards and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis .
our current findings suggest the possibility of using msc therapy in an ards patient and it is the first clinical case of ucb - mscs therapy ever reported . for a clear verification of msc therapy in ali ,
while the recent strategies of lung - protective ventilation and proper fluid restriction therapy have reduced mortality in patients with acute lung injury ( ali ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , the mortality rate remains high .
a 59-yr - old man with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis ( tb ) and no significant family history was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia in june 2008 .
accordingly , mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) have been introduced as a possible therapy .
in early research on the use of mscs to treat ali / ards , the main mechanism of action of these cells seemed likely to involve the replacement of injured lung epithelium . however , subsequent studies have suggested that the most important therapeutic effect probably comes from the paracrine properties of mscs ( 2 , 3 ) .
