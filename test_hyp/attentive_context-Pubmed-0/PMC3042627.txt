the aim of this case report is to present a patient with rhinocerebral mucormycosis who was successfully treated due to timely diagnosis , effective surgical intervention , and intravenous antifungal treatment .
a 22-year - old woman was transferred to the oral and maxillofacial department for facial pain , oedema , and double vision , following extraction of the upper right third molar tooth three days earlier .
as known , a raised glycated haemoglobin level is indicative of a poor blood glucose control by the diabetic patient .
dental care may also precede such an infection , by means of a creation of a postextraction or postcurretage wound , which may be susceptible to fungal infection .
the patient had initially visited an ear - nose - throat specialist because of diffuse pain of the midface a week previously .
if the dentist had required a serum glucose or glycated haemoglobin test , he might have estimated the poorly controlled diabetic condition and might have avoided the unnecessary extraction of the upper right third moral tooth . instead , a more precise dental examination might have shown the need for further investigation of the patient 's facial pain .
