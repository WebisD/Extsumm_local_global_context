in preparation for this paper , several online search engines were used to gather journal articles that focused on studying the efficacy of surgical weight loss as compared to the conventional medical therapies and intensive lifestyle modifications .
recent research data has offered a much better understanding of the pathophysiology and outcomes of these management strategies in obese patients . in this paper , the authors have summarized the results of major studies on remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduction of cardiovascular events by weight loss induced by different methods .
furthermore , an individual screening of the articles was conducted for prospective , randomized , and controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of surgical versus medical / lifestyle intervention for weight loss and long - term cardiovascular and diabetes outcomes .
the increasing rates of diabetes in children and adolescents and the limited capacity of the current therapeutic treatments to slow the disease progression raise the concern for a full blown diabetes tsunami for the generations to come .
these methods have been shown to confer overall health benefits ; however , their effect on remission of preexisting diabetes mellitus and reduction in cardiovascular risk has been variable .
