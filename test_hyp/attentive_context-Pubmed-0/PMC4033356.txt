further evaluation of liver histology showed no statistically significant difference in mean fibrosis score , mean portal tract inflammation score , mean piecemeal necrosis score ( pmn ) , mean lobular inflammation score , mean histologic activity index ( hai ) score , and mean inflammatory score between pnalt group and elevated alt group ( table 3 ) .
female gender , absence of dm , and abstinence from alcohol were associated with pnalt .
in conclusion , histological changes observed in hcv patients with pnalt will argue that alt is not a reliable indicator of hepatic inflammation or fibrosis .
most notably , patients with pnalt had a higher rate of cirrhosis ( p = 0.007 ) .
13 ( 41% ) with pnalt were african american ( aa ) compared to 87 ( 41% ) with elevated alt , 14 ( 44% ) were caucasian ( w ) compared to 79 ( 38% ) with elevated alt , and 5 ( 15% ) were hispanic ( h ) compared to 44 ( 21% ) with elevated alt .
there were no differences in age at biopsy , tobacco use , bmi , rna level , and duration of infection between pnalt and elevated alt groups ( table 2 ) .
