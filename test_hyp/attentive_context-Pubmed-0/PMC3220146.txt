two cases of foreign objects found within the pulp chambers of the deciduous teeth with their management are presented here .
a 10-year - old girl reported with a chief complaint of pain and pus discharge from the upper front tooth on the right side .
the occurrence of foreign bodies such as metal screws , staple pins , darning needles , pencil leads , beads and tooth picks lodged in the exposed pulp chambers of carious or traumatically injured deciduous and permanent teeth has been reported . most often , these cases are diagnosed accidentally on radiographic examination of the tooth which may be associated with infection , pain , swelling and recurrent abscesses as a sequelae to the pulpal exposure and lodgement of the foreign body .
though the presence of foreign objects retrieved from the root canals and pulp chambers of the permanent teeth have been reported , the presence of foreign objects found in the deciduous teeth is an uncommon situation .
clinical and radiographic examinations are necessary to confirm the presence , size , location and the type of the foreign object .
timely diagnosis and management of foreign object embedded in the tooth should be done to avoid further complication .
