the purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of surgery using inferior conjunctival autografting and to address the importance of preserving the glaucoma filtration site .
this was a prospective , noncomparative , interventional case series study enrolling 50 eyes of 50 patients with pterygium between november 1 , 2010 and october 30 , 2011 at geta eye hospital , dhangadhi , nepal .
we observed conjunctival scarring at the donor site in four eyes ( 8% ) ; however , there was no symblepharon formation or restriction of upgaze .
we can use the inferior bulbar conjunctiva safely and effectively for grafting in pterygium surgery as a surgical alternative for preserving the glaucoma filtration site in the future .
table 2 shows that patients in the younger age groups and those engaged in outdoor occupations had a tendency to recurrence of pterygium .
we performed surgery on 58 eyes from 58 patients , but eight patients were lost to follow - up . hence , in this study , we enrolled only 50 eyes from the 50 patients who completed the six months of follow - up .
patients may have glaucoma and pterygium together , and surgeons may miss glaucoma in the early stages .
