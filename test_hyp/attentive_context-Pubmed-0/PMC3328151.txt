btx - a is a promising treatment adjunct in improving functional outcomes in children with musculoskeletal conditions by causing a flaccid paralysis of the affected muscles .
further studies should include a prospective methodology , longer follow - up periods , and comparison group and evaluate whether repeated injections are required to improve the outcome of children , thus providing evidence on the effectiveness and safety of this drug in children with musculoskeletal conditions .
, the use of botulinum toxins appears as a promising treatment on its own , as an adjunct to other treatment modalities and as an alternative to surgery .
several authors have suggested the use of btx - a in children with musculoskeletal conditions , yet the evidence supporting its safety and effectiveness is not well established .
proper and timely treatment including standard approaches such as physiotherapy , casting , bracing , and surgery is essential to ensure the child optimal growth and development . besides these traditional modalities
the objectives of this systematic review were to establish the evidence on the effectiveness , safety , and functional outcome of btx - a in children with musculoskeletal conditions .
the use of btx - a in children with cp has been widely documented   and is beyond the scope of this paper .
