generalized linear model confirmed that clinical pregnancy and delivery rates in ohss patients were significantly higher in frozen embryo transfer , 63.1% and 45.6% , compared with fresh embryo transfer , 55.1% and 35.4% , respectively ( table 1 ) .
demographic data of group a and group b patients significant difference with group a average numbers of oocytes retrieved in these groups were 22.144.3 and 21.024.9 , and after fertilization , embryos cryopreserved per patient yielded averages of 13.823.5 and 12.54.3 in fresh ( a ) and frozen ( b ) embryo transfer groups respectively . thaw and et
in conclusion , for the patients who are at risk of ohss , the embryos would be vitrified for frozen embryo transfer in order to reduce complication of fresh embryo transfer in ohss cycle and improve the pregnancy rate .
mean ( sd ) ages of these patients were 26.783.5 and 28.424.2 yrs and combinations of male and female factors were 28.3% and 32.1% in fresh ( a ) and frozen ( b ) embryo transfer groups respectively . 
 
, we presented the efficacy of elective cryopreservation of all embryos in patients at risk of ohss in comparison to the fresh embryo transfer cycles in patients with similar potential risk of developing the syndrome .
