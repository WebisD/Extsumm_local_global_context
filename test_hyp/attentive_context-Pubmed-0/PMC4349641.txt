we hypothesized : 1 ) the incidence of femoral component overhang would be reduced with the use of gender - specific femoral components and 2 ) clinical and radiological results would show no difference between two types of implants in a short - term follow - up because no clinical disadvantage of overhang has been reported so far .
there was significant difference in the incidence of overhang of femoral component between the gender - specific implant and the traditional implant .
potential advantages of gender specific implants , such as avoidance of overstuffing in the patellofemoral joint , soft tissue irritation and anterior knee pain , should be evaluated in a long - term follow - up study .
sixty - two knees ( 59.6% ) that demonstrated overhang with traditional trial components were replaced with a gender - specific implant ( group i ) and the remaining 42 knees ( 40.4% ) that showed no overhang with traditional trial components were replaced with a traditional implant ( group ii ) . therefore , the incidence of overhang after final implantation was 26/62 knees ( 41.9% ) in group i and no overhang ( 0/42 knees ) was observed in group ii . as a result ,
