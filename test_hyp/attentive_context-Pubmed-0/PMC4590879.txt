this defence involves sophisticated mechanisms for detecting various invading bacteria and combating them by the innate and acquired irs . to improve dairy animal resistance against imis , further investigation concerning mg
immunology should focus on the following : ( 1 ) enhancement of immune functions or at least the maintenance of these functions at normal levels under various lactating and nonlactating conditions , especially during periods of immune suppression ; ( 2 ) clarifying the roles of specific mammary immune cells , primarily lymphocytes , and in particular the roles of nk cells and  cells , which are not fully defined ; ( 3 ) in vivo and in vitro investigation of mgirs against certain common bacteria in bovines , including s. uberis , s. dysgalactiae , s. agalactiae , coliforms other than e. coli , and cns because most research studies concerning mgirs have focused on staph . aureus and e. coli , as most studies using other pathogens have involved experiments in ovines and focused on cytokine levels only without detailing the cellular responses ; ( 4 ) clarifying the roles of certain chemokines as rantes and cytokines such as il-17 , tgf , and csf in mg , as well as lf effect against gpb because its role is not clearly understood ; and ( 5 ) changes of leukocytes population in mgs of ovines and caprines during imis .
