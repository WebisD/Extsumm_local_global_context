the aim is to explore how home care workers coordinate their daily work , identify coordination issues in situ and discuss possible actions for supporting seamless and integrated elderly care at home .
two important issues of the studied home care setting must be addressed to support seamless and integrated care : the division of care interventions that are defined as  self - treatment and the coordination difficulties that arise from the fact that workers are distributed in time and/or space .
one approach that can be used to explore this perspective is an ethnographic workplace study . in this paper ,
the first issue concerns the fact that care is provided by two organisations and can be resolved through policymaking or through the merger of the home help service and home health care into one organisation .
cooperative work goes beyond organisational boundaries and integrated care must be developed with this situation in mind , beyond organisational boundaries . in view of this , a core subject for future practice and research is to develop it tools that reach beyond formal organisational boundaries and processes while remaining adaptable in view of future structure changes .
however , since informing and communicating between time shifts within an organisation was shown to be more difficult than between organisations , this may not help resolve the second issue . a more effective solution to this issue may be the introduction of it tools that support distributed access to information and communication between all care workers involved , regardless of organisational belonging .
