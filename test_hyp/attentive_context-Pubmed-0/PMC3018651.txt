transplantation of embryonic renal or pancreatic primordia to replace the function of diseased organs offers theoretical advantages relative to transplantation of either pluripotent es cells or of fully differentiated ( adult ) organs ( reviewed in   ) .
while the transplantation of human embryonic organs in human hosts has been contemplated   , we   and others   have focused on the use of embryonic organs from the pig , a physiologically suitable donor for human pancreas or kidney replacement   .
, exocrine pancreatic tissue does not differentiate following transplantation , obviating complications that can result from exocrine components such as the enzymatic autodigestion of host tissues .   
the ability of cellular primordia to attract a host vasculature renders them less susceptible to humoral rejection than are adult organs with donor blood vessels transplanted across a discordant xenogeneic barrier ; ( 5 ) organ primordia differentiate selectively . in the case of embryonic pancreas
there is no requirement to steer differentiation and no risk of teratoma formation ; ( 2 ) the growth potential of cells within embryonic organs is enhanced relative to those in terminally differentiated organs ; ( 3 ) the cellular immune response to transplanted primordia obtained early during embryogenesis is attenuated relative to that directed against adult organs ; ( 4 ) early organ primordia are avascular .
