this article reviews the application of several imaging fusion techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors .
minimally invasive surgical treatment , minimally invasive treatment guided by imaging navigation , and specific therapy of targeted drugs are important aspects of precision oncology . with further development of medical imaging technology , information from different imaging modalities can be integrated and comprehensively analyzed by the imaging fusion system , which provides more image information of tumors from different angles and dimensions to accurately make qualitative and quantitative diagnoses and achieve the aim of precision tumor treatment .
the arrival of the precision medicine era brings new opportunities and challenges for patients undergoing precision diagnosis and treatment .
multimodality image fusion technology has become the main trend in the development of future imaging technology .
the morbidity and mortality rates associated with malignant tumors have increased year by year , and the burden of malignant neoplasms is increasing .
precision medicine plan brings new opportunities and challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors with advances both in the field of human genomics , metabolomics , and proteomics and considers data from other large - scale biological databases . with our current understanding and background of medicine ,
