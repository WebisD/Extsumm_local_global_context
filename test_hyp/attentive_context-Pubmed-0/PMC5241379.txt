pulsed - dose - rate ( pdr ) treatment is a bt modality combining the physical advantages of high - dose - rate ( hdr ) technology ( isodose optimization , radiation safety ) with radiobiological advantages of conventional low - dose - rate ( ldr ) bt . despite its favorable radiobiological features , pdr - bt has rarely been used as a component of bct . here ,
study group included 96 consecutive patients with microscopically confirmed early breast cancer , 17 of whom , with initial t1 - 3 or n1 - 2 tumor , received induction chemotherapy .
the median volume of tissue receiving 150% ( v150 ) of the prescribed dose was 10.7 cc ( range : 2.87 - 33.44 cc ) , and the median dose homogeneity index [ dhi ] , defined as 1-(v150/v100 ) , was 0.72 ( range : 0.53 - 0.78 ) . in 91 patients , bt has started the day after the implant placement , and in five patients bt was delayed by 1 - 2 days .
, the extent of boost tumor volume may be incorrect if the tumor bed is determined using clinical parameters ( e.g. , palpation , pre - operative mammography , scar position , operative and pathology reports , or surgical clips placed at the excision site boundaries )   .
