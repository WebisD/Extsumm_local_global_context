this article presents the case of a young woman found to have an intimal flap in the infrarenal abdominal aorta after a car accident , and the injury progressed to a pseudoaneurysm over 3 months .
blunt traumatic infrarenal aortic injuries are rare , with a few case reports in the literature .
a 47-year - old woman with a history of hypertension and smoking was involved in a  high - speed motor vehicle accident and presented to the emergency department with back pain .
a more common occurrence is an intimal flap which may form after blunt injury to the aorta , and most of these will resolve with anticoagulation alone   .
blunt aortic injury which initially presents as an intimal flap ( grade i ) may progress and evolve into an intramural hematoma ( grade ii ) or a pseudoaneurysm ( grade iii ) .
aortic intimal flap progressing to dissection or pseudoaneurysm is an occurrence identified in 2% or less of the patients , and the majority of these occur in the thoracic aorta   .
one prior publication did document the delayed occurrence of a post - traumatic infrarenal aortic pseudoaneurysm that was diagnosed 3 years after injury .
