the aim of the present paper is to review the current knowledge on ent manifestations of hiv infection , and present the available diagnostic and treatment options .
finally , the presence of ent disease in patients on antiretroviral therapy could be the result of an increase in the plasma hiv - rna and suggest treatment failure . in this context , the provision of appropriate care to hiv patients may require a multi - disciplinary approach .
the implications of the early identification of hiv - associated ent disease from a public health perspective are also discussed , along with clinical markers of immune compromise .
in addition , the occurrence of certain oral manifestations in patients with known hiv disease who are not receiving treatment may be related to the progression of the disease .
it is important that ent doctors are aware of the ent conditions associated with hiv disease , and the respective diagnosis and treatment .
indeed , up to 80% of hiv - infected patients eventually develop ent manifestations . among the latter , oral disease seems to be the most common , occurring in approximately 4050% of hiv positive patients .
hiv is an rna retrovirus which compromises the immune system , and renders the infected person susceptible to opportunistic infections and malignancy .
