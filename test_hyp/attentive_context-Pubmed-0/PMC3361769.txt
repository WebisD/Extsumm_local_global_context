we describe a case of pseudotumor cerebri in a young man developing 4 years post - traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) .
this is a rare clinical scenario and delayed presentation following tbi with chronic headaches should raise this possibility .
a 29-year - old male was admitted to our unit with head injury following a road traffic accident .
detailed clinical history and examination with appropriate investigations must be performed to diagnose this condition .
when a post - head injury patient presents with history of chronic headache with visual disturbance , pseudotumor cerebri should be considered a strong possibility .
neuroimaging in the form of brain ct , mri , and mr venogram must be considered to rule out vascular pathology and a diagnostic lumbar puncture is recommended .
we experienced the difficulty in managing the patient in the later stage due to shunt dysfunctions with associated slit - ventricle syndrome .
pseudotumor cerebri is a relatively common neurologic illness and may be an important preventable cause of blindness in obese young women .
this procedure was resorted to , as a last option for controlling headaches and it is known to be effective in symptomatic control in the some group of patients described in the literature . the prognosis for vision in most patients with pseudotumor cerebri is excellent ; however , visual loss , which is the only serious complication , may occur either early or late in the course of the disease .
