was used for simultaneous identification and quantification of amino acids , nucleosides , and nucleobases in the extracts of t. clavigera .
however , the amino acids were usually determined by visible spectrophotometry after derivatization with ninhydrin in previous study , which has low sensitivity and complex pretreatment procedure . in the present study , we collected t. clavigera samples from 19 areas along the coasts in china . to determine these hydrophilic compounds in two categories , hydrophilic interaction ultra - performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry ( hilic - uplc - tq - ms / ms )
the results showed that , as traditional seafood , t. clavigera has excellent source of amino acids , nucleosides , and nucleobases with great nutritional and functional values .
the determination results of amino acids showed that the contents of lysine are between 8.19  mg / g and 19.10  mg / g accounting for 5.2212.11% in our study , which was more than that in dongji island ( 4.91% ) by previous report .
meanwhile , inosine is reported to protect liver   and inosinic acid is studied to be fresh aid related to the delicious taste . in this study , it is the first time that hilic - uplc - tq - ms / ms has been utilized for the simultaneous determination of these bioactive compounds in t. clavigera from 19 habitats as a sea snail .
