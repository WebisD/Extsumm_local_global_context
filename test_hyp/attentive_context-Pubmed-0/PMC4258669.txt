participants were divided into two groups using permuted block randomization : ( a ) 30 patients in vitamin d group ( capsules containing 50,000 iu vitamin d ) , ( b ) 30 patient in the placebo group .
hence , the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin d supplementation on inflammation in patients with nafld .
a significant increase was seen in calcium serum in the intervention group in comparison with baseline ( p < 0.05 ) and compared with the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) . after adjusting for baseline values , levels of alt ,
further studies with strong design and more sample must conduct to demonstrate the effect of vitamin d supplementation on inflammation in patients with nafld .
compliance with the treatments was good in both groups and no side - effects were presented . on the basis of 5-d dietary intake and physical activity records , no significant differences were seen between the two groups [ table 3 ] . the comparison of subclinical characteristics at baseline and after intervention of study adjusted changes in metabolic variables in nafld who received either vitamin d supplements or placebo fatty liver grades in nafld who received either vitamin d supplements or placebo dietary intakes and physical activity of nafld who received either vitamin d supplements or placebo throughout the study vitamin d supplementation resulted in an increase of serum 25(oh ) d concentrations in inter group ( p < 0.05 ) and intra - group ( p < 0.05 ) . at the end of study , in the intervention group , tg and crp reduced significantly compare with baseline ( p < 0.05 ) .
