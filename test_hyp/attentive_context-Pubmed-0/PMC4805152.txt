in the present study , we report an eco - friendly , non - toxic , cost - effective method for synthesis of agnps from a. digitata pulp extract as reducing agent . in this method , naturally occurring materials are acts as reducing agents such as bio - molecules such as phenols and proteins present in plant extract as a simple and alternative to complex physical or chemical synthetic procedures
. 3 to 57 nm size , spherical shaped , polydispersed nanoparticles are produced from a. digitata pulp extract confirmed by afm , sem , and tem prove this plant extract as an effective reducing agent for the production of narrow range of nanoparticles by industrial scale .
hence , the present study is aimed to synthesize agnps from a. digitata fruit pulp extract , characterize and to know the potentiality of agnps against different microbial pathogens .
further antimicrobial studies reveal that small size , spherical shaped particles have immense activity against different microbial pathogens and acts as eco - friendly antimicrobial agents .
