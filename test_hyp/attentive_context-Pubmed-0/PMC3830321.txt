gierke , in 1905 , described a lesion of adrenal gland containing fat and myeloid elements .
a 40-year - old man referred to department of endocrinology with adrenal mass and hypertension .
the association of adrenal myelolipoma and hypertension may not be entirely coincidental , as it may be associated with catecholamine secretion , as seen in our case .
abdominal contrasted computerized tomography showing well - defined non - homogeneous mass of right adrenal origin in view of hypertension , adrenal mass , and elevated 24-hour urine metanephrines ( > 3 times ) , possibility of pheochromocytoma was considered .
( original magnification , 100 ) immuno - histochemistry of specimen revealed positive for chromogranin a the patient had remission in hypertension .
all these patients became normotensive and biochemical abnormalities normalized following surgery similar to the patient in our case .
immuno - histochemistry of specimen revealed positive for chromogranin a , suggestive of catecholamine - secreting granules in the tissue [ figure 4 ] .
patient underwent surgery , and well encapsulated right adrenal tumor ( weight : 500 gm ) was excised [ figure 2 ] .
functionality of the adrenal mass in this patient was suggested by the presence of hypertension and elevated metanephrines .
