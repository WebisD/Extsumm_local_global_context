the adaptive immune response in post - olt hepatitis b recurrence is hidden under strong antiviral hbig and na combination treatment .
adaptive immune responses , especially of the cd4 and cd8 t cells and the treg , have strong effects in post - olt hepatitis c viral recurrence and in recurrent hepatitis activities .
however , the effectiveness of active immunization is dependent upon adaptive immune responses being effective for patients with non - hbv - related disease who have received anti - hbc antibody - positive donor livers and patients with acute liver failure who are not immune tolerant to hbv .
hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection are the main causes of end - stage liver disease requiring orthotopic liver transplantation ( olt ) . however , the post - olt course is quite different between the two types of hepatitis .
vaccination is not sufficiently effective for patients with liver cirrhosis ; nevertheless , the donor immune memory for hbv and the strength of the immunosuppressant drugs have important roles .
we summarize the aberrant immune system in hbv- and hcv - related hepatitis , together with the changes in these diseases after olt .
