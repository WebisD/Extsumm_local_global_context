  this work develops a detector and demonstrates its application to identify known and unknown genomes for composition - based classification methods , and we demonstrate that our detector with a hybrid method outperforms current homology - based methods .
nbc and phymm 's ease of use , speed of training and testing , combined with its log - likelihood output ( or in the case of phymmbl , hybrid scores ) make them attractive , simple , yet elegant designs for large - scale metagenomic classification and comparison .
  mass amounts of high - throughput sequenced dna are being produced as a result of metagenomics projects , and new tools are needed to identify the taxonomic content of these environmental samples .
, we address this detection problem and show that we can use the likelihood scores as confidence scores and can interpolate the scores between different read lengths to obtain a consistent detector of  known  reads . in this paper
for example , a species - level confidence detector may reject a read but the genus - level detector may accept it . this would indicate that this is a new species within a known genus . to detect these novel genomes , we show that composition - based methods perform better than homology - based methods on the finer resolution of taxonomic levels . the   nave bayes classifier ( nbc ) and phymmbl offer fast and attractive solutions , because they are based on the dna 's compositional word - frequency occurrence and are able to give a log - likelihood score or similar that can be used to develop such a detector   .
