the second aim was to assess the relationship between the frequency of infection and health status , tested using a point prevalence study ( pps ) and  incidence study for the analysis of capabilities to implement targeted continuing surveillance only in the high - risk portion of ltcf residents .
surveillance ( pps and incidence study ) encompassed 193 people , of which 86 comprised residents ( 44.6  % ) belonging to the rhs group and 107 persons ( 55.4  % ) made up the nh group .
the rates from the two studies can not be compared directly , owing to different methodologies , but both are used in national programmes in europe and throughout the world . in italy , the incidence was estimated to be 11.8/1,000 pds , with a prevalence of 8.4/100 residents   , and in norway , it was 5.2/1,000 pds and 6.7/100 residents , respectively . in the usa ,
hence , the objective of this study was to estimate the epidemiology of infection , depending on the  type of ltcf .
the lowest value of the scale , 0 , was associated with a 62.5  % risk of developing this type of infection ( rr 1.8 ) , as well as in residents with a scale value of 115 ( incidence 62.9  % , rr 1.9 ) . in residents with higher values of the scale ,
