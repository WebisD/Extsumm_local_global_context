we present 3 cases that highlight these difficulties and the broad spectrum of drug eruptions in the setting of lymphoma patients receiving multidrug regimens including bendamustine .
drug eruptions are common , affecting 23% of all hospitalized patients , and complications associated with medications make up the largest proportion of adverse events seen in hospitals .
a 60-year - old caucasian female presented with a 6-month history of constitutional symptoms , dyspnea on exertion , lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions and was diagnosed with stage iv marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow involvement .
a biopsy revealed interface dermatitis with a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate . in our case of dress syndrome ,
drug eruptions can be difficult to diagnose , particularly causality , as even biopsies are nonspecific and patients are often on more than one potentially offending medication .
another case report described a severe desquamating rash involving > 75% of the skin as well as oral mucosa .
case 3 also represents a more atypical presentation than initially reported , with a reaction after the second cycle rather than after initial exposure to the drug . however , no other causative agent was found .
a biopsy revealed a diffuse eosinophilic infiltrate . in a case series of 16 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or follicular lymphoma , over 50% of the patients developed an erythematous maculopapular rash .
