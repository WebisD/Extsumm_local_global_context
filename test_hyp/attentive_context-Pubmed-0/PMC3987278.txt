this is the first case of pituitary apoplexy presenting as myocardial infarction to be reported from india .
haffner et al . showed that the incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction to be 3.5/100 person - years in nondiabetics as compared with 20.2/100 person - years in patients with t2 dm . a 62-year - old male patient coming from the interiors of maharashtra ( kolhapur ) , india , a nonsmoker , nonethanolic , on the background history of diabetes mellitus since the past 10 years , presented with sudden onset severe headache , right sided ptosis , for which he got admitted in a local hospital .
imaging of the brain showed pituitary macroadenoma . within a few hours of admission he developed features suggestive of acute left ventricular failure secondary to acute coronary syndrome ( non - st - elevation myocardial infarction associated with elevated serum troponin t , regional wall abnormalities of mid and basal septum and apical and lateral wall of left ventricle on 2d - echocardiography .
there may be an argument for aggressive cardiac evaluation and treatment in patients with t2 dm associated with hypopituitarism .
a coronary artery bypass surgery was planned , which was undertaken successfully under appropriate steroid and thyroid hormone cover .
