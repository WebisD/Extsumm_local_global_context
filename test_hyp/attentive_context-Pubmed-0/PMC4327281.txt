the purpose of this study was to evaluate by strain gauges the preload and torque removal values on three abutment screws ( gold , titanium , and titanium with surface treatment screws ) applying an equivalent torque force ( 30.070.28 ncm ) .
titanium screws presented the highest torque removal values , followed by gold screws , and surface - treated titanium screws .
the mean preload values of the gold screws was 131.728.98 n , and presented statistically significant differences ( p<0.01 ) compared to groups
it may be concluded : 1 . gold should be the material of choice for abutment fixation screws , since it produced the highest preload values , followed by surface - treated titanium screws and conventional titanium screws ; 2 .
titanium screws presented a mean removal torque of 18.751.89 ncm , and showed statistically significant differences ( p<0.001 ) .
the highest preload value was obtained for screw # 7 ( 49.68 n ) , while screw # 3 presented the lowest value ( 25.30 n ) . in the group of surface - treated titanium screws ,
the group of surface - treated titanium screws present statistically significant difference ( p=0.004 ) ( mean : 16.431.33 ncm ) .
