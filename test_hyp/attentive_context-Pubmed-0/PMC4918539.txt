the functions of telomerase and telomeres have been examinedin many aspects of reproduction biology , such as fertilization , placental development , stress and hypoxia conditions during pregnancy , as well as premature aging following iugr .
can improve our understanding of the significance of telomerase in fetal development and lifelong consequences on illnesses and aging processes in different populations .
it is noteworthy that under pregnancy - related pathological conditions , ta is decreased or absent , which results in significantly shorter telomeres . in depth studies on telomere biology during reproduction
telomerase and telomeres functions , due to their roles in apoptosis and senescence , have been examined in many aspects of reproduction biology , such as fertilization , placental development , stress and hypoxic conditions during pregnancy , as well as premature aging following intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr ) .
importantly , premature aging phenotypes , collectively termed ' telomere syndromes ' ( 6 ) , can be induced by rare mutations in human tert ( htert ) .
this understanding may lead to better prevention policies and may perhaps reveal novel therapeutic strategies .
age - related diseases manifest mostly in old age ; however , the aging process at the cellular level can be viewed as a lifelong progression ( 5 ) .
