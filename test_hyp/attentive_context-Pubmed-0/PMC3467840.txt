the drug solution was added to bio - material solution and mixed by magnetic stirrer until emulsion is formed .
fried seeds subjected to grinding by adding sufficient water to it for 30 - 45 min . the mixture was filtered through muslin cloth and pea nut milk is separated .
five different formulations were formulated using various proportion of bio loaded sustained release bio - micro particles was performed .
it had t50% and t 80% of 1.56 hrs and 2.45 hr formulation fg-5 shows percentage yield t50% and t80% of 1.62 hrs and 2.61 hrs at hence these two formulations are the best among the five prepared formulations .
release of drug through egg shell membrane : egg shell membrane was separated using con . the egg shell membrane attached to the tube . measured quantity of micro particles
same procedure was repeated for different formulated films of aceclofenac with phosphate buffer ( ph-7.4 ) .
indomethacin was dissolved in chloroform and bio - polymer solution was prepared by adding water to it .
the dissolution studies were perform and subjecting it for dissolution for 3 hrs and analyze the samples by uv spectrophotometer at 320 nm .
