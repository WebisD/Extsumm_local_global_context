we aim to underline the importance of screening for sarcoidosis before and during the follow - up of hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) patients undergoing antiviral therapy .
the relationship between the occurrence of sarcoidosis and interferon alfa ( ifn- ) therapy in viral hepatitis c was suggested in earlier reports.  this was also supported by the spontaneous resolution of sarcoidosis after cessation of ifn- treatment for hepatitis c. reported clinical manifestations include cutaneous sarcoidotic lesions , pulmonary nodules , and peripheral neuropathy . in this paper , we report the second case in the literature of fatal central nervous system sarcoidosis secondary to ifn- and ribavirin treatment .
sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystemic disease of unknown origin ; it is characterized by an accumulation of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas .
, clinicians should be aware of associated potential complication while evaluating the benefit / risk ratio of the treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis c infection .
since march 2002 , a 47-year - old woman without any history of sarcoidosis was regularly monitored in consultation for chronic viral hepatitis c ( genotype 1 ) . in april 2007 ,
based on this case report , inf- associated sarcoidosis might also include cns involvement and might lead to death . considering earlier reports of heterogeneous spectra of sarcoidosis manifestations
