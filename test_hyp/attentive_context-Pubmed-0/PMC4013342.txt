in particular , this perspective provides a focus on the work of whitesell and lindquist who have proposed , in essence , a novel theory of cancer , asserting that cancer cells acquire a hyper - mutating phenotype and further claiming that control of cancer will best be achieved by modulating cells ' ability to adapt and evolve in response to selection pressures .
what draws our attention here are two distinct advances : first , the recent clinical successes of velcade ( bortemozib ) , a drug that inhibits the protein destruction pathway , which was approved in 2003 by the food and drug administration ( fda ) of the us for use in refractory multiple myeloma ; and second , the multiplicity of hsp90 inhibitors in phase ii clinical trials ( hsp90 is one of the chaperone proteins intimately involved in protein folding mechanisms ) . based on these developments and a better understanding of protein homeostasis ,
i aim here to provide information that may lead to a novel perspective on cancer , with a focus on the dynamic state of the proteome as it relates to cancer .
p53 is constantly being synthesized , folded , and degraded , and its half - life is extended in response to various cellular stresses. the final section concludes by describing how this understanding that linking protein folding , proteostasis , and cancer may point to future directions in the discovery and development of cancer chemotherapy .
