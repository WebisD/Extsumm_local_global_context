autogenous tooth bone grafts always require that the tooth of the patient be extracted , and thus , its use is limited in many cases . therefore , familial tooth bone grafts that treat the extracted teeth of immediate family members as bone - graft materials have been introduced .
thus , it is difficult to perform an accurate clinical evaluation of familial tooth bone graft .
the possibility that autogenous tooth bone graft may be a substitution for autogenous bone graft has been suggested4 .
ridge augmentation refers to the procedure that was performed for cases with insufficient vertical or horizontal volume of bone to augment the height or width of the alveolar ridge by executing particulated or block bone graft .
the grafted bone in sinus and peri - implant bone were maintained well in case 2 .
a 45-year - old male patient was transferred from another dental clinic for maxillary anterior horizontal ridge augmentation .
ridge augmentation is a type of onlay graft , and thus , the possibility of bone resorption after grafting and dehiscence of the upper soft tissues is high .
the maxillary sinus is wrapped well within its walls , and maxillary sinus bone graft shows healing similar to the wound created by tooth extraction .
