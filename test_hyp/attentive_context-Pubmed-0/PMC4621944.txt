therefore , the purpose of this study was to evaluate marginal and internal adaptation of restorations fabricated with different versions of the cad / cam software and the effect of different parameter settings .
variables such as different versions of software and space parameters were analyzed in the four groups of crown impressions , and the fit of the crown was measured using the replica technique . as the results showed , the crowns designed using the version 4.2 of the software produced a better fit than those designed using the version 3.8 of the software , particularly in the axial wall .
in addition , the use of the version 4.2 of the software combined with the spacer parameter set at 80 m showed the least variation . on the other hand ,
the fit of a crown restoration can be affected by the specific cad / cam software version and by the parameter settings selected , even if the same scanner and milling machine were used . in comparison with the version 3.8 of the cad / cam software ,
the version 4.2 of this software can be recommended for the fabrication of well - fitting crown restorations , and for the appropriate regulation of the spacer parameter . even though the 80-m spacer setting produced a larger gap , this setting can be recommended for the version 4.2 of the cad / cam software because it has shown a good repeatability .
