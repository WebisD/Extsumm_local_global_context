overall , both rigid and flexible bronchoscopy , are safe and effective procedures for diagnosis and treatment of airway and pulmonary pathology .
bronchoscopy requires skilled operators and continues to evolve technologically to the advantage of both the physician and the patient .
the majority of complications , as expected , occur in patients with high levels of comorbid disease undergoing more extensive therapeutic interventions .
endoscopic techniques that allow visualization of the airways of patients with pulmonary maladies have become a mainstay of medical treatment . since the invention of the rigid bronchoscope in 1897 by gustav killian , along with its refinement by chevalier jackson in the early 20 century , and shigeto ikeda 's introduction of the flexible bronchoscope in 1967 ;
these instruments have become important clinical assets in the armamentarium of surgeons , intensivists , and pulmonologists .
bronchoscopy , both fiberoptic and rigid , encompasses a number of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to visualize the luminal surface of the trachea and proximal airways .
more recent advances include stent placement for relief of airway compression , laser applications ( tumor resection ) , curtailing hemorrhage ( using cryocoagulation / cryotherapy ) , assisting in the placement of percutaneous tracheostomies , and securing the airway through facilitation of endotracheal tube placement .
