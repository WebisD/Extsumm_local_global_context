, we evaluated serum cpeptide levels measured by cleia and clarified the clinical features of fulminant type 1 diabetic patients based on residual endogenous insulin secretions .
the patients with detectable serum cpeptide levels showed a significantly lower mvalue ( median 2.94 , range 0.966.15 ,
patients who kept more serum cpeptide levels needed significantly fewer daily dosages of insulin ( p  <  0.01 ; figure  2 ) .
our present results suggest that even very low levels of serum cpeptide could reduce daily dosages of insulin and stabilize blood glucose controls in fulminant type 1 diabetes .
serum cpeptide concentrations of the former four patients ranged from 0.007 to 0.10  nmol / l ( 0.020.29  ng / ml ) and those of the latter eight patients were always less than 0.003 
residual insulin secreting capacity shown as serum cpeptide level and daily dosages of insulin indicated a significant negative correlation ( * p  <  0.01 ) .
it is important because preserving cell function , even at a low level , could help to stabilize blood glucose levels in patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes . in conclusion ,
maximal concentrations of serum cpeptide evaluated by cleia were 0.020.10  nmol / l ( 0.060.29  ng / ml ) in four patients and < 0.003  nmol / l ( 0.01  ng / ml ) in eight patients .
