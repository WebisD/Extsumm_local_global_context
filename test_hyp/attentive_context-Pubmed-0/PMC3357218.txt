genetic epidemiologic studies of single nucleotide polymorphism , if large and unbiased , can provide evidence of the association between candidate gene and disease risk .
this human genome epidemiology association review is an updated meta - analysis of the relationship between the ppar pro12ala polymorphism and susceptibility of dn in t2 dm patients .
no significant impact of the pro12ala polymorphism on the risk of proteinuria was observed , as ors ( 95% ci ) were 0.98 ( 0.581.67 ) , 3.64 ( 0.3240.6 ) , and 1.04 ( 0.621.75 ) for pro / ala versus pro / pro , ala / ala versus pro / pro , and ala carriers versus pro / pro , respectively .
stratified analyses of ala carrier versus pro / pro and nephropathy susceptibility of t2 dm patients forest plots of the meta - analysis for pro12ala polymorphism of ppar associated with nephropathy in t2 dm patients . to avoid the influence of heterogeneity among the included studies ,
the overall meta - analysis , based on 18 case - control studies involving 3,361 case subjects and 5,825 control subjects , indicates that the polymorphism is associated with the risk of t2dm - dn . considering the significant heterogeneity among the identified studies ,
