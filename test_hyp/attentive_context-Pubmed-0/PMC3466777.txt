isolate the urea 
 effect on defined conformers from the unfolding process itself and 
 by restraining the protein structure ( ii ) observe 
 the competition of urea and water for protein interaction in the absence 
 of protein dynamics .
 this has implications 
 for the relative weights of the contributions to the solvation force 
 of the ( co)solvent components . in the direct comparison of the force 
 distributions of the protein  urea and protein
we have previously introduced shannon entropy 
 maps and analyzed the hydration properties of water at the surface 
 of prp , identifying particular loci with different entropies . by studying the effect of urea on folded and 
 intermediate structures , we ( i )
the 
 direct comparison of urea and water forces on the protein was performed 
 on rescaled forces to compensate for the dependence of the solvation 
 forces on the urea concentration .
hexafluoro-2-propanol has been shown to affect the ultrastructure 
 of prp amyloid and to decrease the -sheet content as well as 
 prion infectivity .
the individual 
 preferences to interact with urea or water follow a hydrophobicity 
 scale in a similar trend as force field energies of amino acid analogues .
in contrast , 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanol does not 
 inactivate prion infectivity but alters the morphology of the rods 
 and abolishes congo red binding .
