changes in serum ck and degree of muscle rigidity , and the temporal relationship between these factors , were evaluated in a large number of patients with nms .
mild muscle rigidity was observed in about 71% of 24 cases , and the degree of muscle rigidity was worst on the fourth day , after which it gradually resolved .
pearson s correlation test demonstrated that serum ck concentration was positively correlated with the degree of muscle rigidity ( r=0.0392 , p < 0.01 [ figure 1 ] ) .
mild muscle rigidity was observed in 17 of 24 cases ( 71% ) before the onset of fever . during the course of nms
as shown in table 3 , overall serum ck peaked on day 2 and normalized to 165 iu / l ( mean ) ( normal range 46210 ) on day 12 .
furthermore , the relationship between ck concentration and the degree of muscle rigidity over the time course of nms from onset has not been established . in the present study ,
the findings of our study confirm physicians empirical knowledge of serum ck concentration and muscle rigidity in nms based on the data accumulated from numerous patients with this syndrome .
