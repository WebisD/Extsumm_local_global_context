synchronous primary lung cancers are uncommon and the occurrence of synchronous non small cell lung carcinomas ( nsclc ) with different histological morphologies within the same lobe is rare .
the aim of this report is to discuss surgical and oncological management of this entity together with a review of the current literature .
a 61-year - old female smoker ( 42 pack years ) was found to have left upper zone shadowing on chest x ray following a history of weight loss .
patients with resectable synchronous primary non small cell lung carcinomas within the same lobe should be offered surgical resection after careful pre - operative staging .
skin metastases should be biopsied and egfr testing should be requested in order to determine the originating the tumour and to assess the patients suitability for anti egfr - tki treatment .
positron emission tomography in conjunction with computed tomography ( pet - ct ) showed two nodules in the left upper lobe .
our patient had a disease free survival of 12 months post surgery despite a positive lymph node , but she later developed recurrence with distant subcutaneous metastases and an endobronchial mass , which was treated palliatively .
