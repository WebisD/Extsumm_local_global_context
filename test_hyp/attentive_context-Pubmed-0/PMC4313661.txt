comm . ) and although 2 of the positive specimens in our study originated from young cattle with respiratory symptoms but no identified respiratory pathogen , further studies are also warranted to provide an understanding of the pathobiology of influenza d virus in cattle and its putative role in complex bovine respiratory disease .
webster et al . suggested the existence of a common ancestor for influenza a , b , and c viruses and a more recent common ancestor to influenza a and b viruses only considering the different genome organizations between influenza a / b and influenza c viruses ( 6 ) .
retrospective studies with archived samples would help date the emergence of influenza d viruses and enable an understanding of their evolution .
in addition , the splicing pattern of the matrix gene segment and the reduced 5-n - acetyl binding pocket in the hemagglutinin - esterase ( he ) protein of d / bovine / france/2986/2012 was similar to that of c / ok and different from that of human influenza c virus , confirming the similarity of d / bovine / france/2956/2012 and the newly described swine and bovine us influenza d virus strains .
