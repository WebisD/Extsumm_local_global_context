with this review we provided an update on clinical features , pathogenesis and treatment option of nc . nc is a rare epidermal nevus .
, we will provide an update on clinical features , pathogenesis , and treatment options .
new data are available on signaling pathways in acne - related disorders that may have an impact on nc as well .
in contrast to the acne - related comedones , the epithelium is often hyperkeratotic and sometimes acanthotic and comedo extraction is not as easily achieved as with acne comedones .
new developments in laser technology may become an alternative in near future . with a more detailed understanding in molecular pathogenesis , targeted therapy
dermatologists should be aware of potential association of nc with skin tumors and extracutaneous findings such as ncs .
it is a rare type of an epidermal nevus usually with predilection for the face and neck area .
nc is part of the nevus comedonicus syndrome ( ncs ) , a term coined by engber in 1978   .
clinically nc is characterized by closely arranged , dilated follicular openings with keratinous plugs resembling classical comedones .
