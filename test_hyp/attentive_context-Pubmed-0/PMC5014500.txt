has not been completed in the khuzestan province , the aim of this study is to evaluate the levels of thyroid hormones and tsh in patients with beta - thalassemia in the city of ahwaz .
serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone ( tsh ) were also higher in the treatment group than the control group and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .
logistic regression analysis shows statistically significant differences in serum levels of t4 ( or : 0.58 , with a 95% confidence level and 0.46 to 0.72 of confidence interval ) and tsh ( or : 1.57 , with a 95% confidence level and 1.22 to 2.01 confidence interval ) between the two case and control groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
. these findings double the importance of the annual assessment of thyroid function and early diagnosis in patients with beta thalassemia . with regard to the likely effect of iron on this disorder ,
serum t4 levels were lower in the case group than the control group and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
the logistic regression analysis showed that serum t4 level in the experimental group was 0.58 , compared to the control group , and serum tsh level in cases is 1.57 times more than the control group . despite the high ferritin levels in some studies which showed increased body iron , serum levels of pituitary - thyroid
