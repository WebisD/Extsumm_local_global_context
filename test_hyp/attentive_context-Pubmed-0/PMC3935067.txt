the present study was therefore conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily use of tadalafil 5 mg in the treatment of ed patients after ralp .
once daily administration of tadalafil 5 mg was effective and safe for ed patients who had undergone ns ralp , and the patients showed gradual improvement in their ef over a period of 1 year .
moreover , there was a significant increase in all 5 domains of the iief-5 in the tadalafil group , whereas in the non - tadalafil group no significant increases were observed in any of the domains at 1 year ( q4 , p<0.0001 ; q1 , p<0.0001 ; q3 , p<0.0001 ; q2 , p=0.006 ; q5 , p<0.0001 ) . in the tadalafil group ,
most of the patients who had undergone ns ralp experienced ed after the surgery . at 6 months , the total iief-5 scores of the tadalafil group and the non - tadalafil group were 10.03.4 and 7.04.0 , respectively ( p<0.0001 , mann - whitney u test ) . at 1 year after the surgery , the total iief-5 score in the tadalafil group was significantly greater than that in the non - tadalafil group ( 13.25.6 vs 7.74.8 , p<0.0001 ; mann - whitney u test ) .
