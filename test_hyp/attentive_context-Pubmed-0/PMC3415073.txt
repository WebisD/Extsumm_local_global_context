  congenital abnormalities ( cas ) concern all diseases of organs or body parts developed in utero
future research and multicentric , large - scale trials should be directed to epigenetic profiling of congenital diseases , including neural tube defects .  
one of the major breakthroughs in ca prevention has been the evidence that periconceptional folate supplementation can reduce the risk of neural tube defects ( ntds )   and other congenital abnormalities like cardiovascular malformations ( cvms ) , cleft lip and palate , urogenital abnormalities , and limb reductions .
  the etiologies of congenital abnormalities lie in epigenetics in the vast majority of cases .
scientific as well as political effort is mandatory in order to implement global preventive public health strategies using fortification and supplementation .
they are multifactorial , maternal as well as paternal , but universally associated with environmental teratogens .
prevention of cas is defined by individual and public health strategies that can reduce their prevalence .
these active strategies include nutritional interventions , prevention of maternal infections and diseases , periconceptional care of sick mothers ( epileptic or diabetic ) , control of professional and environmental exposure to teratogens , and special attention to pregnancies exposed to major health determinants such as obesity , tobacco , alcohol , and drugs .
