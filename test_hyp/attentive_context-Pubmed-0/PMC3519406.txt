cervical arthroplasty is a viable treatment option for cervical herniated disc / spondylosis with radiculopathy . the inclusion / exclusion criteria of us fda trials should be followed .
inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) fda trials comparing c - adr with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( acdf ) ; ( 2 ) follow - up  4 years .
the purpose of this systematic review is to provide a summary of the available literature reporting long - term follow - up of c - adr and to elucidate whether the favorable outcomes seen in the short - term continue after 4 to 5 years .
inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) fda trials comparing c - adr with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( acdf ) ; ( 2 ) follow - up  4 years .
c - adr achieves neural decompression and preserves normal segmental motion at the operated level at 4 to 5 years follow - up .
several prospective , randomized , controlled clinical trials regarding cervical artificial disc replacement ( c - adr ) have been published . however , the number of c - adr patients with long - term follow - up for more than 4 years is still sparse .
