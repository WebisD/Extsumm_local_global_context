we report the cases of a 33- and a 39-year - old man presenting with a retroperitoneal extragonadal tumor and bilateral tm without a focal testicular mass .
a 39-year - old man with a 6-month history of lumbar pain came to our hospital to perform an mri examination in order to rule out a lumbosacral hernia .
nevertheless , it is still uncertain whether ultrasound surveillance is really necessary in patients with tm in the absence of other risk factors such as previous testicular cancer , a history of cryptorchidism or testicular atrophy .
on the basis of our direct experience , we highlight the importance of annual ultrasonographic surveillance of the testis and retroperitoneal space in patients with occasionally detected tm . besides , taking into account the increased risk of metachronous testicular malignancy in patients with previous egct   , we recommend yearly testicular ultrasound follow - up after surgical removal of retroperitoneal gonadic tumor .
many studies have demonstrated an association between diffuse bilateral testicular microlithiasis ( tm ) and gonadal germ cell tumors and egcts   .
primary retroperitoneal germ cell tumors account for approximately 30% of extragonadal germ cell tumors ( egcts ) and for about 10% of all primary malignant retroperitoneal tumors .
