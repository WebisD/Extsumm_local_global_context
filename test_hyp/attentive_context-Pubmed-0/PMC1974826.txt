the combination of a sulfonylurea and a thiazolidinedione may be a particularly effective treatment option in the early stages of type 2 diabetes when -cell function is at its highest .
this allows maximal benefit to be obtained from the insulin secretion - promoting abilities of the sulphonylureas and the -cell - protective effects of the thiazolidinediones .
the insulin secretagogue sulfonylureas and biguanides represented the mainstay of oral glucose - lowering therapy from their development in the 1940s to the 1990s .
the combined benefits of thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas may delay the progression of type 2 diabetes and the need for exogenous insulin therapy , and may also offer benefits in terms of reduced risk of cvd .
type 2 diabetes manifests in an insulin - resistant individual when pancreatic -cells are unable to produce sufficient insulin to overcome insulin resistance in the muscles and liver . intervening early to attain glycaemic control and protect -cell function
is now regarded as central to improving long - term outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes .
, there is a strong rationale to support the early combination with thiazolidinediones in type 2 diabetes .
