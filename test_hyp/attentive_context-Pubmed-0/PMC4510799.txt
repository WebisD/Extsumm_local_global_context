the aim of this study was to describe the surgical technique , outline the advantages of the technique when compared with proximal femoral shortening osteotomy , and to report our mid to long term clinical results .
12 patients with crowe type iv dysplasia underwent surgery at our institution in which cementless arthroplasty with a distal femoral shortening osteotomy is performed between january 2004 and december 2010 .
the mean preoperative pain component of the harris hip score was 20.2 ( range 10 - 40 ) .
the mean postoperative pain score was 42.5 ( range 18 - 44 ) . at last followup ,
despite advances in total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) , severe developmental dysplasia of the hip continues to pose a challenge to the orthopedic community.123 there are many anatomic deformities in a dysplastic hip , including increased proximal femoral anteversion , deficient acetabular bone , a small and narrow femoral canal , as well as soft tissue contracture.45 it is generally recommended that the acetabular component should be placed in the true acetabulum for better biomechanics.3567 however , several studies have been published reporting that a leg lengthening of over 4 cm can result in sciatic nerve palsy.389 fortunately , evidence has shown that the risk of postoperative nerve palsy can be substantially reduced by femoral shortening.1011 a variety of proximal femoral osteotomies have been described for the treatment of severe developmental dysplasia of the hip.4510121314 multiple studies have shown relatively good clinical results when these techniques were used as part of the treatment protocol.581215 however , there are some problems and potential pitfalls associated with proximal femoral shortening such as nonunion , difficult surgical technique and is time consuming.511 consequently , the optimal osteotomy strategy for treating severely dysplastic hip remains controversial . to overcome the above shortcomings at our institute , we have adopted cementless arthroplasty with a distal femoral shortening osteotomy
