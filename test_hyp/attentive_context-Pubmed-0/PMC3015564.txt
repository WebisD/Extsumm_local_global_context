this series is our initial experience with the ligasure device in the performance of laparoscopic nonanatomic resections of the liver using a sus scrofa pig model .
open resection animals ( groups i and ii ) were depressed postoperatively , had decreased appetite , and required analgesia . in contrast , laparoscopic animals ( group iii ) were alert , responsive , and feeding ad libitum 1 hour after recovery from anesthesia .
intraoperative blood loss and operative times were significantly lower using the ligasure device and are shown in table 1 .
the application of laparoscopic techniques to these procedures should be considered only where full support for advanced laparoscopic procedures is available , and by surgical teams experienced in all aspects of liver surgery .
not unexpectedly , thermal injury from standard electrocautery was 4 times greater than that observed in tissue examined where the ligasure device was used , as measured on histological specimens .
histological examination of excised liver and remaining liver at sacrifice showed secure sealing of all biliary and vascular structures in the ligasure groups .
the effectiveness of this device for liver resection is not known , but we hypothesize that it has excellent potential for use in laparoscopic nonanatomic liver resection .
