therefore , prevention of exacerbations is one of the most important goals of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) management ( global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease 2005 ) because of the impact on patients daily activities and health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) , with these effects lasting for several weeks or months ( haughney and gruffydd - jones 2004 ) .
acute exacerbations of copd are characterized by a change in cough , sputum production , and respiratory symptoms from baseline that cause the patient to seek medical attention and involve increasing the dose and/or frequency of existing bronchodilator therapy .
it is an important outcome because it indicates that following aggressive treatment of an acute exacerbation with an oral corticosteroid , therapy with an ics / laba combination may better control the disease than treatment with bronchodilator alone . in particular , as highlighted by calverley ( 2004 ) , combining treatments is certainly something to be considered in patients who have reported exacerbations on a regular basis but have not yet received ics or laba therapy in combination , although there are concerns about the increased risk of side - effects and cost of using laba / ics therapy in copd .
