the lld is associated with increased incidences of pathologies that reduce patient satisfaction and quality of life .
this was done by comparing change in limb length after tka based on hka , bmi , and kl grade .
the p value for the change in limb length after a 2 sample t test for each of the groups was 0.870 , 0.730 , and 0.567 for the moderate , severe valgus , and severe varus groups , respectively .
further research is necessary to better characterize the incidence of lld after tka and to determine whether a need exists to adjust surgical techniques to prioritize maintaining limb length during the procedure .
those with a valgus alignment tended to have a greater increase in limb length . for this group ,
next , the patients were separated into preoperative limb alignment ( valgus / varus ) , and the average limb length differences for each group were determined and compared .
the limb length of the 2 groups was compared pre- and postoperatively and did not demonstrate a significant difference , as the p value was 0.916 and 0.521 for the less severe and severe osteoarthritic deformity groups , respectively .
