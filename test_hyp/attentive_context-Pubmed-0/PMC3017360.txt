here we describe a simple and inexpensive modification where we raised the temperature of the golgi  cox solution in which moderately thick slices of brain were incubated only for 24  h and that gave us significantly more impregnation of stain and consistently excellent results in terms of stained neurons .
incubating the brain tissue around body temperature at 37    1c improved golgi 
the effects due to the presence of blood and its constituents or due to perfusion with pbs were ruled out by using the brain taken out with or without perfusion with pbs .
cox staining efficiency and reduced the time of staining , which were the primary drawbacks of using golgi  cox method .
cox method mentioned above could be by increasing random motion of the metallic ions in the staining solution facilitating their influx and deposition within the neurons ; thus reducing the time required as well as increasing the success rate of more stained neurons and reproducibility of results .
stained neurons ( 100 ) in sections through cortical ( a and c ) and sub - cortical ( b and d ) areas after incubation of the brain blocks for 24  h at 37    1c ( a , b ) and at 26    1c ( c , d ) are shown .
