the main purpose of this study was to investigate the root morphology of korean mandibular third molars , and to evaluate the prevalence of c - shaped ( gutter - shaped ) , two - rooted , and three - rooted mandibular third molars with distolingual roots .
there was a high prevalence of two - rooted and one - rooted mandibular third molars from a korean population , and it was found that the incidence of multi - rooted third molars tended to increase with patient age .
cone - beam computed tomography images showing mandibular third molars with one root ( arrow ) mandibular third molars with one root with c - shaped canal ( arrow ) mandibular third molars with two roots ( arrow ) mandibular third molars with three roots having distolingual root ( arrow ) statistical analyses of the occurrences , according the contributing factors , were performed using the chi - square test .
this study used cbct images to evaluate the number of roots and the morphology of 214 mandibular third molars in 137 korean individuals .
the incidences of mandibular third molars with one - root , c - shaped roots , two roots , or three roots were evaluated by age group , gender , and topology [ figures 14 ] . to evaluate the bilateral occurrence of one - rooted , c - shaped , and three - rooted mandibular third molars ,
