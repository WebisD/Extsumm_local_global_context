the acuteness of avian influenza ( h5n1 ) outbreaks requires a concerted effort to enhance knowledge and change behavior among those most at risk in low - income countries .
human cases of avian influenza ( h5n1 ) have resulted from contact between humans and infected backyard poultry ( 4 ) .
provinces exposed to avian influenza and intensive information , education , and communication campaigns ( kabul , march 2007 , and nangahar , february 2007 ) .
preintervention and postintervention surveys would provide a more robust measure of effectiveness . in the immediacy of an outbreak ,
the level of concern generated by the campaign , government response , media reports , and proximity to the outbreak are all likely to contribute to this association . despite this encouraging evidence , level of knowledge was far higher among persons with higher socioeconomic status .
overall knowledge was low , although in provinces exposed to intensive iec campaigns , kap scores of the population were higher .
messages should carefully balance the risk for human disease against potential nutritional and economic consequences of high population concern ( e.g. , food scares ) . successfully promoting behavior change is a lengthy process and requires frequent reinforcement .
