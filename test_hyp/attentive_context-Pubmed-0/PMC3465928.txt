thus , we conclude that increased activity of nep is associated with sensory nerve dysfunction in an animal model of diet - induced obesity and that dual inhibition of ace and nep may be more effective than monotherapy in reducing insulin resistance and the sensory nerve complications associated with metabolic syndrome .
however , little information is available about the effect of vasopeptidase inhibitors in animal models of diet - induced obesity . in order to further elucidate the effects of vasopeptidase inhibitors in peripheral nerve dysfunction associated with obesity we examined the effect of diet - induced obesity on nerve conduction velocity and thermal response latency in the hindpaw of c57bl/6j mice and mice deficient in nep treated with ilepatril , enalapril , ace inhibitor , or candoxatril , nep inhibitor   .
in contrast , inhibition of nep improved sensory nerve dysfunction and had no effect in improving weight gain or glucose utilization . treating high - fat - fed mice with a vasopeptidase inhibitor improved weight gain , glucose utilization , and sensory nerve function .
the mechanisms proposed for the improvement in obesity and glucose tolerance with treatment of rodent models with ace inhibitors are increased energy expenditure , liver and adipose tissue metabolic modulation , lower concentration of leptin , improved insulin signaling , and increased glucose and fatty acid utilization by muscle   . in a study comparing the effects of ramipril , an ace inhibitor , to ilepatril in jcr : la - cp rats , an obese , insulin - resistant , hyperinsulinemic , normoglycemic model , it was found that both compounds reduced the surge of plasma insulin in a meal tolerance test by about 50% but ilepatril was more beneficial in improving vascular reactivity . in our study
