tubers processed by boiling had the lowest glycemic , index while those roasted and baked had significantly higher glycemic indices .
however , little information is available on the glycemic indices of sweet potatoes and their impact on blood glucose and glycemic response after consumption .   as such , the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of different processing methods on the gi and glycemic responses of ten sweet potato cultivars that are commonly eaten in jamaica .
foods baked and roasted had high gi values , while those fried ( sweet potato wedges ) had intermediate to moderately high gi values ( 63  2 to 77  4 ) .  
the results therefore indicate that method of food preparation significantly impacts on the glycemic index of jamaican sweet potatoes ( p < 0.005 )
the gi values were significantly lower for foods processed by boiling ( ganja variety having the lowest gi = 41  5 ) when compared to the other processing methods ( p < 0.05 ) .  
this study is the first to report variations in the glycemic indices and blood glucose responses among the sweet potato ( ipomoea batatas ) cultivars eaten in jamaica and the wider caribbean with respect to different cooking methods .
