these data allow us to distinguish countywide outbreaks and trends from single - hospital changes in resistance patterns , and enable infection control efforts to expand or narrow to the appropriate scale . with awareness programs , county surveillance can broaden physicians knowledge of their hospital s effects on the community , as well as the effects of neighboring hospitals on resistance patterns in their particular hospital .
we have shown that county surveillance of bacterial resistance is a useful addition to local hospital surveillance , particularly as antibiotic resistant bacteria increasingly spread from hospital to hospital and into the community at large . across the county , annual proportions of mrsa and vre isolates significantly increased over the 4-year period .
additionally , county surveillance that includes subcategorization of isolates by ward is invaluable in identifying patients at high risk and locations for transmission of resistant bacteria .
not surprisingly , we report our highest proportion of mrsa and vre isolates from icu and nursing home units .
we also evaluated whether the wide variability in the proportions of resistant bacteria among san francisco hospitals was linked to hospital indices .
one mrsa isolate with intermediate resistance to vancomycin and three vancomycin - resistant s. epidermidis isolates were noted in microbiology laboratory reports . as with the organisms recently reported in the united states ( 3537 ) ,
