the family environment has been bombarded with new expectations , the media , high cost of living and a striving for better quality of life .
thus a mental health professional need not be there merely to diffuse a difficult situation arising out of deviance of an employee .

the dual - earning couple is a new prototype that reflects the increasing educational and career aspirations of women .
relationship - focused family life education programs for the target group of employees at the workplace may actually serve to fulfill this purpose , whereby employees , through group interaction and experiential learning , can be taught skills to deftly handle family - life conflicts either by themselves or through the support of mental health professionals .
