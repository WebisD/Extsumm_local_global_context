the discovery of unknown coronaviruses provides information for a model of coronavirus evolution ( 11 ) and contributes to understanding the process of disease emergence , as in detection of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( 12 ) .
given detection of this coronavirus , more thorough characterization of the ecology of viruses and other microorganisms in native wildlife should be considered to fulfill conservation needs and further safeguard human and domestic animal health against cross - species transmission .

this country is free from many human and animal diseases , such as rabies and foot - and - mouth disease , and infections with human arboviruses because of recent colonization by humans and strict biosecurity border controls ( 15 ) .
an expanded survey for mystacina bat coronavirus in mammals in new zealand and subsequent characterization of viral genomes would provide further insights into the origin of coronaviruses .
the genus alphacoronavirus includes several human and animal pathogens , but on the basis of phylogenetic data in this study , it is not possible to estimate the risk posed by mystacina bat coronavirus to human or animal health .
