taking into account mbc results , the lab and s. xylosus are among the most sensitive bacteria . in a functional milk beverage fortified with phenolic compounds
the aim of the study was to assess the in vitro bactericidal effect of purified phenols extracted from oil vegetation water ( peow ) obtained by membrane filtration techniques from vw on several food - borne strains ( spoilage bacteria , food - borne pathogens and starter cultures ) .
the two thresholds proposed for the pathogenic food - borne bacteria need to be considered together with other pertinent food aspects ( e.g. organoleptic traits , antioxidant effects ) .
in other fermented products , the supplementation of higher levels of peow , as a natural ingredient , could reduce the performance or the quality of ripening .
this work is the first step before the use of these substances on the food models ( e.g. challenge test and storage test ) for the further application of this extract as an ingredient .
for further applications , a deep screening of starter cultures is required in order to select the species able to grow in presence of phenol during fermentation .
the assessment of bactericidal activity could define some threshold doses for a further application on real food models .
