this is the fourth reported case of ischemic colitis secondary to high - dose ergotamine use reported in the literature and the first to require colon resection .
while colitis is always on the differential diagnosis of hospital patients with abdominal pain , the majority of cases are secondary to infectious colitis associated with antibiotic therapy .
widespread necrosis , coupled with clinical deterioration , as in this case , mandated immediate surgical intervention to prevent irreversible septic shock .
finally , ischemic colitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients taking ergotamines who present with abdominal pain .
a diagnosis of ergotamine - induced vasospasm is a diagnosis of exclusion , made when all other etiologies of ischemia have been ruled out . in this case ,
ischemic bowel induced by ergotamines is a much rarer event , with few documented cases in the literature .
the use of ergotamines causing ischemia of peripheral vessels has been reported , particularly in patients with peripheral vascular disease .
while dhe can be useful in patients with refractory migraines , patients should be informed of the risks of both peripheral and visceral ischemia before deciding on this treatment .
