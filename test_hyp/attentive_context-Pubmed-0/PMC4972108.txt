we now demonstrate that -blocker use in cancer patients is linked to reduced tumor cell dissemination to lymph nodes .
as the impact of neural signaling on cancer becomes clearer , it is imperative that stress - sensitive steps in cancer progression are identified for the development of targeted interventions .
this is in line with recent retrospective epidemiologic studies linking -blocker use to improved cancer outcomes .
these findings provide a mechanistic rationale for ongoing clinical trials using -blockers as a possible treatment option for patients with cancer . 

the findings presented here suggest that targeting either neural or inflammatory signaling activated by stress may limit metastatic dissemination and cancer - related mortality ( fig .  1 ) .
tumor - associated macrophages respond to ne / e by secreting inflammatory molecules such as prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) , which drive the production of vascular endothelial growth factor c ( vegfc ) in tumor cells .

activation of the sympathetic nervous system increases levels of catecholamines , norepinephrine ( ne ) , and/or epinephrine ( e ) .
