while the circadian rhythm of glucocorticoid secretion was among the first described , adipose rhythmicity and adipose clocks have raised more recent interest because of their pivotal role in energy homeostasis . by release of endocrine factors ( glucocorticoids and adipokines )
this review will discuss the circadian aspects of hpa axis regulation and adipokine secretion , their known interactions , and the potential consequences for human physiology .
chronotherapeutic approaches targeting this crosstalk may be fruitful in treating metabolic diseases and stress disorders .
together this has led to an increased interest in the interaction of circadian rhythms and health parameters .
it is tempting to speculate that this may not be restricted to targets in peripheral tissues but may extend to central aspects of appetite regulation and stress- and obesity - associated neuropsychiatric alterations .
in order to optimise survival in a temporally variable environment , many behavioural and physiological processes have evolved to have an optimally timed expression .
several metabolic disorders are associated with circadian disruption   , and obesity in particular is often accompanied by altered hpa axis rhythmicity   .
an interaction between the hpa axis and adipose physiology has long been proposed , and the effect of adipokines , adipose derived cytokines , on physiology , particularly with regard to metabolic disorders , is an area of active research . in modern industrial societies , life - style and work demands increasingly interfere with endogenously determined circadian rhythms . off - shift
