we discuss below the position - dependent differential impact of the lesion on -dna stability , as part of our global effort to define lesion - induced energetic alterations that may modulate the processing of potential ber substrates .
a lesion - induced increase in population of these states may lead to erroneous expansion of the repeat sequences , the hallmark of dna expansion diseases .
the results reported here also reinforce our previous proposal of a rough energy landscape for triple repeat dnas and the potential impact of such rough landscapes on biological processes.(37 ) in the aggregate , our data provide a potential rationale for the in vivo observation of ber - induced enhancement of dna expansion.(17 )
such behavior suggests that the abasic lesion induces an increase in dna flexibility , or degrees of freedom , relative to the corresponding lesion - free construct ; that is to say , the presence of the lesions causes the initial states to more resemble the disorder of the final state .
specifically , the lesion - induced impact depends on whether the lesion is located upstream of the loop and on the same strand as the loop ( the cag - fstem construct ) , or downstream of the loop and on the opposing strand from the loop ( the ctg - fstem construct ) ; again , this energetic distinction may be relevant to their possible differential recognition by the machinery of repair .
