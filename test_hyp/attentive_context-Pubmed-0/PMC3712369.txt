numerous polymorphisms in pon1 gene have been described ; however , there is still not enough evidence to support the existence of relationship between metabolic disorders and specific polymorphism in pon1 gene .
serum pon1 levels decrease in states of high oxidative stress like metabolic syndrome , obesity , uncontrolled diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
pon1 , by virtue of its antioxidant property , prevents the formation of oxidized ldl and protects phospholipids in hdl from oxidation by inactivating ldl - derived oxidized phospholipids .
serum pon1 activity was found to be lower in diabetic patients with macrovascular and microvascular complications .
pon is located in a subfraction of hdl containing apo a - i and clusterin ( apo j ) .
plasma paraoxonase ( pon ) activity in human population demonstrates polymorphic distribution due to an amino acid substitution in the active site of the enzyme , giving rise to low- , intermediate- , or high - activity isoenzymes . the polymorphic variation in serum pon activity may affect the metabolism of organophosphates in individuals at high risk of acute organophosphorous intoxication or of organophosphorous - induced delayed polyneuropathy .
after secretion into blood , they bind to hdl particles ; pon2 is expressed widely in a number of tissues but is not present in the blood .
