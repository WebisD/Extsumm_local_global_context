no significant difference could be found between dogs with acute hepatitis and those with extra - hepatic inflammation ( p  >  0.05 ) ; in contrast , the serum concentrations of il-6 in dogs with chronic hepatitis were significantly lower than those in dogs with extra - hepatic inflammation ( p  <  0.01 ) .
the serum concentration of il-6 was measured in dogs with different diseases of the liver .
2 ) ; however , the difference between dogs with chronic hepatitis and those with secondary liver tumours was highly significant ( p  <  0.001 ) . to detect differences in the serum concentration of il-6 between dogs with intra- and extra - hepatic inflammatory diseases or tumours , we compared the dogs with liver disease in this study with dogs that had extra - hepatic diseases .
the serum concentrations of il-6 in dogs with different liver diseases were highly significantly ( p  <  0.001 ) increased compared with those of clinically healthy dogs .
further studies of il-6 and its involvement in liver disease in dogs are necessary to investigate the prognostic use of il-6 in patients with liver diseases .
the difference between acute and chronic hepatitis was also significant ( p  <  0.05 ) .
