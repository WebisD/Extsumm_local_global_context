hence , the 
 purpose of this randomized controlled trial study was to evaluate the effect of yogic 
 exercises on life stress and biochemical markers of stress such as blood glucose levels in 
 nursing students .
* p<0.05 ; * * p<0.01 ; * * * p<0.001 ; ppg : postprandial blood glucose level , sd : 
 standard deviation the postprandial blood glucose level significantly differed between the 2 groups ( yoga 
 group vs. control group , p<0.001 ) and over time ( pretest vs. posttest , p<0.05 ) . for 
 the yoga group , the mean post - intervention postprandial blood glucose level ( mean  sd , 81.3 
  8.7 ) was significantly decreased compared with the mean pre - intervention postprandial 
 blood glucose level ( mean  sd , 90.0  11.4 ) . for the control group , the mean 
 post - intervention postprandial blood glucose level
the 
 mean post - intervention life stress score ( mean  sd , 0.77  0.49 ) was significantly 
 decreased compared with the mean pre - intervention life stress score ( mean  sd , 1.6  0.3 ) . 
 of the life stress subscales ,
as shown in the study results , after 12 weeks of yogic exercises , life stress scale scores 
 were significantly decreased compared with those before starting yoga practice . 
 additionally , nursing students in the yoga exercise group had a significant decrease in 
 their stress levels over this 12-week period , while those in the control group had an 
 increase in their stress levels .
