in the last three decades , a large volume of studies have established that oxidized low - density lipoprotein ( oxldl ) is a useful marker for cardiovascular diseases ( cvds ) ( see   ) .
recently , the importance of the plasma oxldl level as a plausible predictive marker for secondary prevention has been discussed   . to understand the role of oxldl in atherogenesis , it is important to clarify the behavior of oxldl in vivo during atherogenesis , particularly how oxldl is formed , how it moves around tissues , and how it is metabolized . in this paper
, we briefly review recent advances regarding dynamics and kinetics of oxldl in vivo and suggest several possibilities for future research .
oxldl may be transferred between tissues and plasma and does not merely accumulate in the lesions but is equilibrated between the tissues and circulation .
the receptors working in the liver may be different from those of cells in vessel wall tissues .
oxldl can be formed in various sites in addition to the tissue of the vessel wall .
a recent study pointed out that stabilins may have an important role in the recognition and clearance of oxldl and mm - ldl from circulation .
