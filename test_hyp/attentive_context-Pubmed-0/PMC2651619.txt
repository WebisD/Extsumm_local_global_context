hormonal differences between sexes influence intrauterine development and may interact with genetic and environmental factors resulting in a different pattern of susceptibility in adult life to coronary artery diseases in the present study we have considered the effect of gender and diabetes on the relationship between bw and cad .
however , this association depends on gender : the risk of cad is correlated negatively to bw in females but positively in males . in the presence of diabetes this pattern of correlation disappears while it is much more evident in subjects without diabetes .
was found to depend on gender ( p=0.009 ) , while in healthy newborns no statistical significant association was observed ( p=0.541 ) .
a logistic regression analysis with cad as dependent and birth weight and gender as independent has shown a highly significant effect of birth weight ( p<0.01 ) and of the interaction between birth weight and gender ( p<0.01 ) ( data not shown ) .
226 subjects admitted consecutively for treatment of cad to valmontone hospital in rome , italy were studied .
a highly significant association was observed in non - diabetics ( p=0.001 ) while no significant association was observed in diabetic subjects ( p=0.567 ) . in non - diabetics there is a marked decrease of females with high bw and a marked increase of males with high bw .
