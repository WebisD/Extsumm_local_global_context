the utilization of scheduled perioperative iv acetaminophen as part of a standardized protocol for geriatric hip fractures is efficacious for shortening hospital length of stay , controlling pain and decreasing narcotic use , improving participation in pt , and increasing home discharge rate .
other areas of orthopedics have demonstrated the benefit of iv acetaminophen , and this study supports its use in the geriatric hip fracture population .
the aim of this study was to determine whether the implementation of scheduled perioperative iv acetaminophen during hip fracture treatment for those aged 65 and older influenced the following : ( 1 ) length of hospital stay , ( 2 ) pain level , ( 3 ) narcotic use , ( 4 ) rate of missed pt sessions , ( 5 ) adverse effects , ( 6 ) gastrointestinal disturbance , and ( 7 ) discharge disposition .
group 1 consisted of patients treated for 1 year before the initiation of a standardized iv acetaminophen pain control protocol on june 1 , 2012 , and group 2 consisted of those treated for 1 year after the protocol was initiated .
the hip fracture committee at our institution adopted the use of scheduled iv acetaminophen in patients with hip fractures as the standard of care .
