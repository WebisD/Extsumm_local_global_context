large rearrangements are uncommon events explaining cancer - prone glioma families , and novel strategies of exome and whole genome sequencing of glioma families with similar phenotypes are one likely strategy for the future .
in this large family study of gliomas , we found one large deletion in exons 1 - 6 of msh2 in one of the swedish families with a family history of colon cancer .
the aberration in cdkn2a was present in 3 families , all of which have a family history of both breast and colon cancer .
a similar mutation was reported as an american founder mutation in families with lynch syndrome , an autosomal - dominant cancer syndrome traced back to a single couple who migrated from germany , and settled in pennsylvania in the early 1700s .
however , we did not observe the cdkn2a aberration in our families with a family history of melanoma , so it might be possible that other low - penetrance genes contributed to the melanoma - astrocytoma syndrome in this study . in conclusion , candidate genes in known syndromes do not explain these glioma - prone families .
the aberration discovered in cdkn2a supports the finding that germline mutations in cdkn2a / cdkn2b could cause the co - occurrence of the melanoma - astrocytoma syndrome reported previously .
