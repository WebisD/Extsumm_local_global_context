demographic variables in children with asds and normal group in regards to paired associates learning test ( pal ) , individuals with asds had poorer performance on this task compared to normal group ( table 2 )
( t = 17.662 , p = 0.015 ) and " total trials adjusted " ( t = 15.794 , p = 0.013 ) . 
  results of visual memory tests in children with asds compared with normal group without considering the iq as the covariance while iq was considered as covariate , none of the pal variables showed any significant difference between the two groups . in terms of pattern recognition memory ( prm ) and spatial recognition memory ( srm ) tests , significant differences were found between the two groups on " number correct " variable in prm ( t = 6.390 , p = 0.045 ) and srm ( t = 1.026 , p = 0.005 ) tests . considering iq as covariate
children and adolescents with asds had less " total corrects " ( t = 0.786 , p = 0.002 ) and more " prob error given correct " ( t = 0.277 , p = 0.012 ) and " prob error given error " ( t = 13.834 , p = 0.019 ) compared to normal group . by eliminating the iq effect , no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of dms variables .
