groups differed for hypertension by systolic or diastolic criteria ( p < 0.001 ) , high systolic and diastolic blood pressures ( p < 0.01 ) , duration of dependence and number of subjects with increased waist circumference ( p < 0.01 ) , and the prevalence of ms ( p < 0.05 ) .
; p < 0.01 ) , married ( 85.3 vs 66.2% ; p < 0.05 ) , and older ( 38.2 vs 33.9 years ; p < 0.05 ) ; and had higher body weight ( 79 vs 72 kg ; p < 0.005 ) , body mass index ( 27.7 vs 21.6 ; p < 0.01 ) , and obesity ( bmi  25 ) ( 76.5 vs 18.5% ; p < 0.01 ) .
the commonest were increased tg ( 54% ) and waist circumference ( 36.8% ) , and the least common were increased fbs level ( 6.4% ) and low hdl ( 7.6% ) .
older age , higher body weight , and higher body mass index are certain risk factors for development of ms
the prevalence of ms was found to be highest in the alcohol dependent group and it was also in the range of ms reported earlier .
