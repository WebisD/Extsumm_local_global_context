our aim was to design core - matched nes with the following 
 functions : 
 ( 1 ) ability to codeliver hydrophilic and hydrophobic anticancer drugs 
 effectively ; ( 2 ) improvement of the poor pharmacokinetics 
 of ptx and 5-fu by promoting long circulation times and synergistic 
 effects in vivo ; ( 3 ) reversal of resistance to ptx by enhancing its 
 antitumor activity .
the combined core - matched nes facilitate 
 the long circulation of anticancer drugs in vivo , prevent drug loss 
 through rapid clearance and metabolism , and render more drug accumulation 
 in the tumor
schematic illustration of the core - matched 
 nanoemulsions 
 codelivering ptx and 5-fu to achieve the synergistic effects 
 and reversal of mdr .
based on the core - matched technology proposed 
 by our lab , ptx and 
 5-fu were coencapsulated into a single nanoemulsion in the form of 
 prodrugs with high entrapment efficiency ( > 95% ) , good stability , 
 and 
 fine particle size ( < 90 nm ) .
. moreover , the codelivery of ptx and 5-fu in the single 
 core - matched nes contributes to reversal of mdr and the production 
 of profound synergism .
all of these advantages result in the significant 
 inhibition of resistant tumor growth with no obvious toxicity .
