this relatively simple and inexpensive technique could be of great applicability for epidemiological studies , the screening of blood donors and the serological diagnosis of malaria caused by p. vivax . in the present study three purified recombinant proteins produced in e. coli ( gst - msp119 , his6-msp119 and his6-msp119-padre ) and one in pichia pastoris ( ymsp119-padre ) were compared for their ability to be recognized by igg antibodies of individuals with patent p. vivax infection .
serological evaluation was performed with serum samples collected from individuals living in areas endemic for malaria in the north of brazil and compared to serum samples from individuals never exposed to p. vivax malaria .
we compared for purified recombinant proteins produced in e. coli or in pichia pastoris in their ability to be recognized by igg antibodies of brazilian individuals with patent p. vivax infection .
our study demonstrated that for the brazilian population , an elisa using a single recombinant protein based on the p. vivax msp119 can serve as the basis for the development of a valuable serological assay for the detection of p. vivax malaria .
our study demonstrated that , for the brazilian population , an elisa using a single recombinant protein based on the p. vivax msp119 kda can serve as the basis for the development of a sensitive serological test that can be used for epidemiological studies , screening blood donors and diagnosis of p. vivax malaria .
