the purpose of this randomized and prospective study was to examine the effect of rebamipide eye drops to prevent antiglaucoma eye drop - induced corneal disorders .
these results suggest that ophthalmic rebamipide suspensions may improve ocular surface disease as well as corneal epithelial barrier function while allowing for the maintenance of intraocular pressure with antiglaucoma eye drops . the limitations of the current study include a small sample size and a relatively short follow - up duration . because antiglaucoma eye drops need to be continued for long periods , the effect of rebamipide should be evaluated for longer times . in conclusion , these findings suggest that ophthalmic rebamipide suspensions may improve dry eye and repair drug - induced keratopathy when antiglaucoma eye drop - induced ocular surface disorder occurs .
in contrast , significant decreases in fluorescein uptake were observed in eyes treated with rebamipide after 4 and 8 weeks ( 120.7  56.1  ng / ml at baseline ; 87.7  43.8  ng / ml after 4 weeks [ p = 0.012 ] ; and 91.5  37.9  ng / ml after 8 weeks [ p = 0.017 ] ) .
in contrast , no significant difference in fluorescein uptake was observed in control eyes ( 119.9  61.7  ng / ml at baseline ; 123.6  44.4  ng / ml after 4 weeks [ p = 0.671 ] ; and 119.9  42.4  ng / ml after 8 weeks [ p = 0.995 ] ) .
