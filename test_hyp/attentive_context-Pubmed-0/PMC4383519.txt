, little is known about the urinary levels of these angiogenic factors in different stages of dn , and potential correlations between them and albuminuria have not yet been studied . in the present study , we measured urinary ang-2 , ang-1 , and vegf levels to elucidate the possible correlation between urinary angiogenic factors and renal damage in patients with various phases of type 2 dm .
this study is the first to investigate urinary levels of ang-1 , ang-2 , and vegf in human type 2 dm with varying uaers .
the results of this study show that urinary ang-2 increases in a stepwise manner in type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of kidney damage .
, we evaluated simultaneously the levels of ang-1 , ang-2 , and vegf in both serum and urine .
serum levels of ang-2 were significantly positively correlated with urinary ang-2 and vegf levels ( all p < 0.001 ) , as well as with uaer , 24  h upqm ( both p < 0.001 ) , and serum creatinine ( p < 0.001 ) .
ang-2 measurement in urine is a useful , noninvasive tool for the evaluation of renal involvement in the course of dm , especially in normoalbuminuric patients .
