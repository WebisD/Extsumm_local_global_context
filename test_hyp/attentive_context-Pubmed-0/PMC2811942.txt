in a recent issue of critical care , morgan and colleagues present the results of a well - conducted systematic review and meta - analysis of the effect of statin therapy on inflammatory markers after cardiac surgery .
the pleiotropic effects of statins and extensive experience with these agents in cardiology mean that we may be less likely to fall into a trap constructed of an insufficient understating of mechanisms combined with a single - target therapy .
observational evidence suggests that statin therapy may dampen the inflammatory response following exposure to a significant trigger and there is currently much interest in using statins to treat sepsis . in this context cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb )
is appealing methodologically because it allows the study of preventive interventions [ 4 - 6 ] .
once validated , these surrogate endpoints should be used to establish the biological effectiveness of new treatments ( and probably some existing ones ) before moving on to pragmatic studies using mortality as outcome measure . without demonstrating first biological and then functional ( for example , organ performance ) effectiveness , we run the risk of wrongly adding statins to the wasteland of icu pharmacotherapy . on the positive side ,
