we present the details of a patient who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy after an exact preoperative diagnosis of traumatic gallbladder rupture .
management of gallbladder injuries varies with the presence of other concomitant organ injuries and the degree and type of gallbladder injury . in cases with gallbladder rupture simply diagnosed by direct cholangiography ,
traumatic gallbladder rupture occurs rarely and the incidence is reported to amount to approximately 2% of all blunt abdominal injuries .
the gallbladder injury in our case was categorized as a laceration with an exact preoperative diagnosis .
it is very difficult to detect a defect in the gallbladder wall even when using imaging such as ultrasonography , computed tomography ( ct ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
mri and ultrasonography revealed little about the source of the bile leakage ; therefore , on the 10th day after abdominal blunt injury , endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed , and a diagnosis of gallbladder rupture was made ( fig .
after isolating the gallbladder , a perforation was seen in the gallbladder body , as suggested by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography ( fig .
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was planned . because gallbladder rupture is often associated with multiple organ injuries leading to peritonitis
