the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of revised hhss on 
 the foot pressure ratio and static balance during standing .
however , the differences between the 
 two types of hhs were not statistically significant ( table 1table 1.comparison between the general and revised high heeled shoes ( hhss)variablerevised hhssgeneral hhssforefoot ( % ) 51.5  4.962.0  7.3*rearfoot ( % ) 48.5  4.438.0  5.8*eyes open ( score)90.7  5.288.7  4.9eyes closed ( score)88.2  6.885.1  6.2screen blocked ( score)88.2  7.187.0  6.0*p<0.05 ) .
the subjects were 15 young women ( 21.7  2.1  years ; 161.2  5.8  cm ; 50.4  5.6  kg ) in one 
 of two conditions : ( 1 ) wearing general hhss with a heel height 7  cm , or ( 2 ) wearing revised 
 hhss with a heel height 7  cm .
the rearfoot pressure ratio 
 was 48.5% for the revised hhss and 38.0% for the general hhss , and the differences between 
 the hhs conditions were significant .
the forefoot pressure ratio was 51.5% for the revised hhss and 62.0% for the general hhss , 
 and the differences between the hhs conditions were significant .
the spacebalance 3d 
 system was equipped with 2 wireless force plates ( foot placement : 20  cm from heel to heel 
 and 24  cm from toe to toe ) that recorded the weight distribution of 4 zones ( front , back , 
 left , and right ) , and a sensor located in the front measured plate inclination . during 
 measurements
