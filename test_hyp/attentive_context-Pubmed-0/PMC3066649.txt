further research to better define the role of lipid rafts in mast cells could offer novel targets for immunotherapies and treatment of diseases in which mast cells and/or their mediators are involved .
several aspects of raft structure and function in mast cell biology still need to be elucidated . undoubtedly , lipid rafts and their constitutes play a role in many aspects of mast cell biology , such as activation through fcri , morphology , endocytosis , and maturation .
the structure - function relationship of lipid rafts or rafts constitutes are important in various aspects of mast cell biology .
although mast cells may be activated by a number of stimuli and pathways   , the major mechanism for their activation and subsequent degranulation is through the high - affinity receptor for immunoglobulin e ( fcri ) , present in the plasma membrane of mast cells , epidermal langerhans cells , eosinophils , and basophils .
recently , they have gained new importance as immunoregulatory cells with the recognition that they are a major source of cytokines and chemokines and play roles in both innate and adaptive immunities   .
mast cells , like blood cells , are derived from pluripotent bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells but , unlike blood cells , they leave the bone marrow as progenitors and migrate into virtually all vascularized tissues to complete their differentiation under the influence of factors present at each tissue site .
