in addition , we evaluated the percent and total body weight gain as possible factors influencing the levels of this adipocytokine in obese and non - obese pregnant women .
this study suggests that controlling both weight gain and the percent weight gain during the prenatal period may be an important preventive measure to control leptin levels during pregnancy and its subsequent medical complications .
in summary , our results indicate that the significantly greater increase in serum leptin levels in non - overweight pregnant women may be explained by the significantly higher percent weight gain in this group compared to overweight / obese women .
additionally , when the mean serum leptin levels were compared during the first ( t1 ) , second ( t2 ) , and third ( t3 ) trimesters of pregnancy , we concluded that there were significant increases ( t1 vs. t2 , p<0.01 and t1 vs. t3 , p<0.001 ) in leptin levels in group 1 ( non - overweight or g1 ) , as seen in figure 3 .
figure 1 shows that , in the course of gestation , there was a progressive increase in maternal weight gain in both the non - overweight ( bmi < 25 kg / m ) and the overweight / obese ( bmi 25 kg / m ) groups of pregnant women .
