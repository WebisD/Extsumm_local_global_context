this study showed that the variability of fibrotest and actitest values , among nine different laboratories , was acceptable and without clinical consequences for the prediction of the stage of liver fibrosis or grade of activity .
in routine practice , the definition of the upper limit of normal ( uln ) of alt and ggt varies between laboratories , but is rarely detailed . because numerous medical guidelines make reference to alt and ggt expressed as multiples of the uln ( uln units ) , variations in the definition of normal may have important practical consequences .
the aim of this study was to assess the inter - laboratory variability of fibrotest and actitest , including their six serum liver components , in patients with chronic liver disease , and to identify factors associated with that variability .
the intercept and slope between the reference center and other laboratories were excellent for the three proteins with only one decrease for apolipoprotein a1 in a single center using the advia analyzer .
the " gold standard " for assessing fibrosis , liver biopsy , is recommended prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy ; in addition , it is vital for monitoring fibrosis progression . unfortunately , this procedure is invasive , prone to complications , including hemorrhage and death , and has a high risk of sampling error .
