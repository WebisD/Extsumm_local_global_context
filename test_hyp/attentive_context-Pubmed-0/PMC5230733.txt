, we investigated the mortality rate after falls of rural and non - rural older people and explored the risk factors of mortality after falls among older people .
the rural group was significantly younger ( 76.4 years vs 77.8 years , p<0.001 ) , had a greater charlson comorbidity index ( 2.2 vs 2.1 , p<0.001 ) , and took more medications ( 13.7% vs 12.5% , p<0.001 ) than the non - rural group .
rural older people had a higher frequency of fall - related hospitalizations but lower mortality after falls than non - rural older people .
the independent risk factors of mortality after falls included male , older age , non - rural area , severer comorbidity , higher number of medications taken , and presence of inappropriate medication use . after adjusting for age , gender , comorbidity , number of medications , and inappropriate medication use , the rural group had a significantly lower risk of mortality after falls than the non - rural group ( adjusted odds ratio = 0.32 , 95% ci = 0.280.37 , p<0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
the 4-year cumulative all - cause mortality rate after a fall in the non - rural group was 23.4% ( 95% ci = 22.124.7 ) , which was significantly higher than that of the rural group ( 8.8% ) ( 95% ci = 7.99.8 ) .
