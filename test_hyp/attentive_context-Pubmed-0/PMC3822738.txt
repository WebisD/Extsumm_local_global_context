an early cross - sectional study of mild hypertension reported that the predominant hemodynamic feature was a high cardiac output   and this observation has been confirmed consistently since . although not invariably so , the high cardiac output is accompanied by an increased heart rate and several studies have demonstrated that when oxygen consumption is measured , both cardiac output and this parameter are raised . in the mild early stages of essential hypertension
the molecular basis of the physiological remodelling response to hypertension is slowly being understood . the replacement of eutrophic inward remodelling by a pathological change such as hypertrophy appears to herald the development of an increased risk of circulatory disease .
there is evidence for this in the heart , kidney and skeletal muscle but it has not been confirmed in studies of the hepatomesenteric circulation . in other words , it is difficult to provide evidence for a ubiquitous abnormality of sympathetic function in all vascular beds although the overall integrated haemodynamic profile can be ascribed to increased sympathetic discharge .
the challenge ahead is to identify those that are going to develop hypertrophic remodelling against a background of sustained high blood pressure and more indirect measurements of structural changes in blood vessels are urgently required .
