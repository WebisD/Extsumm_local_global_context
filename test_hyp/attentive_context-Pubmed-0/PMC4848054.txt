tfs significantly reduced ptz - induced hypersynchrony at the beta and gamma frequencies , most recently we developed an automatic non - invasive seizure control system based on tfs and tested it successfully on rats .
we have shown that transcranial focal electrical stimulation ( tfs ) via tcres in rat models was effective in reducing penicillin - induced myoclonic jerks , , pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus ( an extreme form of continuing seizures )   and in a third model , we applied tfs in rats treated by pentylenetetrazole ( ptz ) .
the goal is to demonstrate that tripolar electrodes may provide a unique opportunity to record hfos from scalp and thus improve diagnosis of epilepsy and localization of the seizure onset and the irritative zones .
their implementation into clinical practice may eventually help determine where to place and reduce the number of intracranial grids and depth electrodes to be implanted during presurgical evaluation of patients .
state what is intuitively obvious ; artifacts obscuring the eeg at the time of seizure onset can greatly hinder the interpretation of the recorded seizures . during a tonic or tonic - clonic seizure ,
further studies with more patients are needed to more accurately correlate locations of ( presumably abnormal ) hfo activity with clinically determined soz as well as the resected tissue in surgical cases .
