have been constructed to exploit the full potential of the scientific community for knowledge curation , such as ecoliwiki for the model bacteria escherichia coli ( 27 ) , gene wiki for human gene annotation ( 28 ) and pdbwiki for protein structures ( 31 ) . to date , however , there is no community - curated resource for rice . to establish a platform for community integration of rice data and to facilitate efficient management of community knowledge on rice , here we develop ricewiki ( http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn ) , a wiki - based , publicly editable and open - content platform for community curation of rice genes
unlike extant relevant databases , ricewiki features harnessing community intelligence in curation of rice genes , quantifying users contributions in each curated gene and providing explicit authorship for each contributor in any given gene , with the aim to attract more participation from the scientific community in collaborative and collective curation of rice genes .
rice ( oryza sativa ) is not only the most important staple food feeding a large part of the world population , but also an important model organism for biological studies of crops as well as other related plants ( 1,2 ) .
