nowadays , microelectrodes arrays ( meas ) are the state of the art for studies on neuronal network dynamics . by means of those devices it is possible to characterize the neuronal dynamics of several biological preparations ( i.e. , from invertebrates   to different cerebral mammalian areas such as cortex   and hippocampus ) by studying their development   and delivering electrical   or chemical stimulation   to induce synaptic plasticity at the network level .
signal recording systems ( microtransducers ) based on meas and field effect transistors ( fets ) have been established as powerful tools for recording the electrical activity of networks of neurons cultured in vitro   . under this experimental condition
studies of connectivity and synaptic plasticity in dissociated mammalian cultures will help to understand complex dynamics underlying both physiological behaviors and pathological alterations   associated with changes in firing patterns of large populations of neurons as it happens in epileptic disorders .
simultaneous multisite long - lasting recordings with meas have opened new perspectives in the studies of formation and dynamics of complex neural networks allowing detailed investigations at the level of single cells and at population scales both in vitro and in vivo . in the last decades , technical improvements have increased spatial resolution of mea recordings   and recently the detection of subthreshold signals such as synaptic potentials has been demonstrated in invertebrate neurons .
