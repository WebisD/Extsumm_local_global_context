we used the idf definition of metabolic syndrome , excluding the measure of obesity , to determine which obesity measure among wc , bmi , whr , and whtr , and what appropriate cut - off value are most closely predictive of the non - adipose components of the idf 's definition of metabolic syndrome .
to conclude , although the predictive value of different gender - specific wc values is clearly superior to other anthropometric measures for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in both urban and rural population of both genders , a single value of whtr > 0.52 irrespective of gender and area of residence can be used as a universal screening tool for the identification of individuals at high risk to the development of metabolic complications .
the aim of our study was to perform a comparative validation of wc , bmi , whr , and whtr for defining the metabolic syndrome in indian population living in the urban and rural areas of rohtak district , haryana , india .
the optimal cut - off value of wc in urban and rural males was > 89 cm , which was higher than that in urban and rural females , i.e. 83 cm and 79 cm , respectively , while the optimal cut - off for whtr was > 0.51 in rural females , 0.52 in rural males , and 0.53 in both urban males and females .
