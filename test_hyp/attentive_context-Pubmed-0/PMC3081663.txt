austocystin d was originally discovered more than 30 years ago in an effort to identify and characterize secondary metabolites in maize meal cultures of aspergillus ustus ( bainier ) thom . and church.(16 ) more recently , it was reported to act as a selectively cytotoxic agent to certain cancer cell lines with an apparent selectivity toward cells expressing mdr1.(3 ) we sought to elucidate the mechanism of action of austocystin d to uncover a potentially useful approach to selectively target chemoresistant cancer cells that act by expression of abc transporters .
, the natural product austocystin d or compounds with a similar mechanism of action have the potential to target multiple drug resistant tumors , and thus may address a significant clinical need .
these findings suggest a context - dependent cytotoxicity strategy for the design of new therapeutics for multiple drug resistant cancers , where the co - regulation of mdr and cyp enzymes creates a vulnerability to cyp - activated prodrugs that are directly activated in the tumor tissue .
our approach involved the investigation of two possible leads : that abc transporter activity might be required for austocystin d antiproliferative activity and that austocystin d might act by a mechanism similar to aflatoxin b1 , a well - characterized structurally related compound that is activated by cyp enzymes to induce dna damage .
