the case of a patient who underwent reconstruction of the anterior chest wall using a titanium plate sandwiched between two polypropylene mesh sheets is reported .
the procedure with the titanium plate sandwiched between two polypropylene meshes achieved good fixation and flexibility . in patients who require extensive anterior chest wall and sternal resection ,
although various prostheses have been used for anterior chest wall reconstruction , selection of the procedure depends on the surgeons experience .
a 79-year - old woman was referred to our department with a diagnosis of recurrent chondrosarcoma . the first operation for sternal chondrosarcoma included sternal resection and reconstruction with polypropylene mesh and a musculocutaneous flap .
complete resection of the sternal tumor results in a wide defect on the anterior chest wall .
the titanium plate is used to provide protection for intrathoracic organs , while the polypropylene mesh is flexible in both vertical directions and thus allows movement of the chest wall during breathing . in conclusion ,
however , 18  months after the first operation , computed tomography revealed five tumors located on the anterior chest wall and another tumor located in the subcutaneous tissue on the right chest wall .
