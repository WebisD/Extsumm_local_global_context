, we described how a simple digital rectal examination led to the termination of typical af in a 29-year old male .
atrial fibrillation ( af ) is commonly associated with congestive heart failure and strokes secondary to atrial thromboemboli.13 lone atrial fibrillation is a subtype that usually occurs in the younger population and represents af without pre - existing cardiovascular diseases .
thus , this case report provides an implication to use the rectal exam as an additional therapeutic modality for selective af patients .
the case report is valuable for practice in cardiology clinics and emergency medicine for diagnosis and treatment of af patients . a 29 year - old male with no significant past medical history complained of sudden onset of palpitations while walking home from the store on the night of admission .
in conclusion , the case report described how a digital rectal exam and/or valsalva maneuver was able to terminate typical af in a 29-year old male instantly .
the rectal exam is a relatively simple procedure that presents little risks for af patients .
radiofrequency ablation may also be used to prevent recurrence of af in certain individuals . in this report
episodes are often preceded by exercise or emotional stress.1 hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytoma are other rare causes of af.13 pathophysiology of af is not well understood but it is known that ectopic atrial beats stem from areas in the left atrium around the inlet of pulmonary veins.4 an overactive parasympathetic ( vagal ) nervous system may also cause af , such as in athletes .
