the phases 1 and 2 show a significant shift to the cu - rich side of the phase diagram and exhibit , contrary to previously published phase diagrams , , , a first order transition reaction .
the system al  cu has been investigated intensively during the last decades , mainly due to the importance of al - based alloys , for example in aviation and transport industry . in view of this , the main focus of most studies in the system is the very al - rich part .
the 1/2 region was re - investigated and the recent findings of gulay and harbrecht ,   were widely confirmed .
his extensive paper gives an equilibrium phase diagram as well as manifold information on metastable phase equilibria which are not part of the current investigation . according to
the transition between 0 and 1 does not show a two phase field thus indicating a higher order transition and confirming the results of liu et  al . .
examined the cu - rich part of the phase diagram by diffusion coupling , differential scanning calorimetry and high temperature xrd .
although a lot of work was done in the cu - rich part as well , there are still some uncertainties and inconsistencies in the phase diagram present .
