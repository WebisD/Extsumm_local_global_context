this study investigated a change of peripheral b - cell subsets in patients with t1d , lada , and t2d compared with healthy control subjects .
the results show altered frequencies of various b - cell subsets associated with autoimmune diabetes .
the findings also suggest that , similar to regulatory t - cell therapy , transfusion of ex vivo expanded autologous b10 cells might open a new and effective therapeutic strategy in treating autoimmune diabetes .
we analyzed whether the change of b - cell subsets had any association with the clinical manifestations and found that 1 ) mzb and fob cells were correlated with age , 2 ) t2-mzp b cells were associated with sex , and 3 ) b10 and mzb cells were correlated with bmi ( table 2 ) , regardless of the type of diabetes . of note , fpg was positively correlated with mzb and t2-mzp b cells but negatively correlated with b10 cells .
we hypothesized that an altered phenotype of b - cell subsets is associated with autoimmune diabetes .
in addition to the associations in all participants , we examined the correlations between the various b - cell subsets and clinical manifestations in the different types of diabetes . in patients with t1d , the proportion of cd19 b cells associated negatively with fcp ( r = 0.248 , p < 0.05 ) , and the mzb cells exhibited a negative correlation with age ( r = 0.498 , p < 0.001 ) , bmi ( r = 0.364 , p < 0.01 ) , and hba1c ( r = 0.324 , p < 0.01 ) . in patients with lada , cd19 b cells negatively correlated with bmi ( r = 0.498 , p < 0.001 ) and fcp ( r = 0.248 , p < 0.05 ) , whereas fob cells showed a positive correlation with age ( r = 0.236 , p < 0.05 ) .
