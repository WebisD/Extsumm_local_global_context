the aim of this study was to evaluate the flowability , ph level and calcium ion release 
 of mta fillapex , with the addition of 5% or 10% calcium hydroxide powder ( in weight ) , 
 compared to pure mta fillapex and ah plus .
based on the methods and conditions employed in the present study , it is concluded that 
 the addition of 5% calcium hydroxide ( in weight ) to the mtaf provides a reduction in the 
 flowability of the sealer , in conditions required by the iso 6876:2001 specifications 
 and favors a higher alkaline ph .
on 
 the other hand , the mtaf5 and mtaf10 showed similar calcium release ( p>0.05 ) and 
 lower calcium release than the mtaf .
on 
 the other hand , the mtaf5 and mtaf10 showed similar calcium release ( p>0.05 ) and 
 lower calcium release than the mtaf .
after 24 h , 7 and 14 days , the water was assessed for ph 
 levels and calcium release .
the mtaf5 and mtaf10 showed 
 similar ph values ( p<0.05 ) and higher ph level than the mtaf ( p<0.05 ) .
the flowability 
 means and standard deviations ( in mm ) for the mtaf , mtaf5 , mtaf10 and ah plus were 29.40 
 ( 1.05 ) , 20.75 ( 0.89 ) , 16.80 ( 0.71 ) and 21.91 ( 0.36 ) , respectively .
