pancytopenia associated with idiopathic aplastic anemia may pose an increased risk for postoperative bleeding and infection ( 2 ) . here , we report a patient with severe aortic valve insufficiency undergoing bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement who suffered from idiopathic aplastic anemia .
malignant hematologic disorders ( multiple myeloma , myelodysplasia , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and hodgkin 's and non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ) and idiopathic aplastic anemia that occur in the population with an incidence of 0.5 - 5/100,000 increase the surgical operative risk due to coagulation defects , changes of blood viscosity , immunosuppression , and bone marrow insufficiency ( 1 ) .
a 66-yr - old man was admitted to the hospital because of shortness of breath .
( 3 ) , cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation is feasible in patients with idopathic aplastic anemia , and it was not associated with excessive complications that might be expected in a patient with this disorder .
the presence of severe dyspnea and echocardiographically documented severe aortic valve insufficiency led us to schedule a surgery for elective aortic valve replacement . on admission ,
according to the definition of the severity of aplastic anemia ( 5 ) , the patient 's aplastic anemia could be categorized as non - severe aplastic anemia . regardless of the severity of aplastic anemia ,
