up - regulation of the brain ogdhc activity correlates with increased exploratory activity and decreased anxiety .
the up - regulation under metabolic stress may be adjusted by reversible inhibition of ogdhc , normalizing the biochemical and behavioral deviations .
we show a compensatory response of cortex and striatum to the ogdhc inhibition , which correlates with behavioral changes . increasing
, the activity assays do show that ( i ) application of sp induces the brain response at the level of the ogdhc regulation , and ( ii ) the response is to up - regulate ogdhc , obviously compensating for the enzyme inhibition by sp .
that is , the impaired cognition in patients with neurodegenerative diseases was observed along with the decreased ogdhc activity in their brains , whereas in animal model we observe increased exploratory activity with the orientation and inspection efficiency tending to improve ( figures 1 and 2 ) , when the brain ogdhc activity is elevated ( figure 3 ) .
it is important to note that 2-oxoglutarate is the glutamate precursor in the glutamate synthesis from glucose de novo . in view of this , the irreversible degradation of 2-oxoglutarate by ogdhc ( reaction 1 ) is intimately related to the synthesis / degradation of excitatory ( glutamate ) and inhibitory ( gaba ) neurotransmitters . indeed , the perturbed flux through the complex was shown to affect the amino acid levels , which may explain the developmental impact of the ogdhc regulation , shown in our previous paper . in the present work ,
