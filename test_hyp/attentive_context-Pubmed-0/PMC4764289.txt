the aim of this study was to compare gross and fine motor development of infants with the history of lbw with mv and without mv ( wmv ) over 14 days and healthy nbw infants with 8 to 12 months of age using peabody developmental motor scale-2 ( pdms-2 ) . 

we prospectively investigated the development of gross and fine motor skills in infants with the history of lbw and over 14 days use of mv .
the study was conducted on three groups of infants aged 8 to 12 months ( all mentioned ages for lbw infants are corrected for prematurity ) as follows : lbw group , birth weight < 2500 g , in form of mv and wmv groups and with normal birth weight ( nbw ) group . the sample size based on random sampling method

 this study pursued to characterize the motor quotients and compare the gross and fine motor development of lbw infants with and without using mv with nbw infants at the age of 8 to 12 months . 
 


 study population was 70 lbw infants ( wmv group , n=35 ) and ( mv group , n=35 ) and 40 healthy nbw infants ( nbw group , n=40 ) .
