we reviewed the clinical course of this life - threatening complication of ifn treatment along with the already reported myasthenia crisis cases in chc patients .
in patients with chc who is going to receive ifn - based antiviral treatment , whether screening for thymoma or subclinical mg should be included in basal evaluation is not clear but physicians need to keep in mind the potential life - threatening manifestations of mg before and during antiviral treatment especially when patients complain of muscular weakness and easy fatigability .
we experienced a rare case of myasthenia crisis during antiviral therapy for chc , in whom mediastinal thymoma was discovered and successfully managed with surgical thymectomy and meticulous medical care .
a 47-year - old male patient presented with a complaining of sudden diplopia that developed one week after 11-week of antiviral combination treatment for chronic hepatitis c ( figure 1a ) .
standard care for chronic hepatitis c ( chc ) has been a combination of pegylated interferon - alpha ( peg - inf ) and ribavirin , although this treatment has suboptimal antiviral efficacy and significant adverse events . even in the latest treatment recommendation using novel direct acting antiviral agents , interferon ( ifn)-based treatments are still optional .
