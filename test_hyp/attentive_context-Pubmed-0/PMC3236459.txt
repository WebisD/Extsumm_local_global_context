fungal spores are also a cause of allergies , and fungi from different taxonomic groups can provoke allergic reactions . in this paper , after a brief presentation of the medical impact of fungal infections at the global level and a summary of clinical treatments available today for clinicians , we will review the mechanisms underlying in vitro resistance to antifungals in fungal species of major importance in human medicine .
lastly , an overview of ongoing research undertaken to develop new therapeutic strategies to fight against fungal infections will be exposed .
, high throughput diagnostic tools could be used in the course of treatment of fungal infections in order to detect resistance and adjust therapeutic strategies accordingly before any clinical evidence and therefore allow a rapid adjustment of the antifungal treatment .
these last years were very rich in better knowledge of molecular basis of antifungal resistance and more generally of the metabolism of pathogenic fungi .
one of the challenges of finding new antifungal targets in c. albicans was the lack of sophisticated screening technologies often employed with other fungal species such as saccharomyces cerevisiae .
antifungal drug resistance appears to essentially be due to point mutations in either drug targets or transcription factors regulating actors of the resistance . in the near future
