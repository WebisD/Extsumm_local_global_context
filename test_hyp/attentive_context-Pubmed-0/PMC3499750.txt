this report , and the finding of celf4-deficient mice with overlapping traits , for example , seizures , hyperactivity , and obesity , adds to the growing evidence that celf4 is important for the brain development and in the disposition to obesity .
here , we report a male patient with a translocation involving chromosomes 12q and 18q with borderline iq , developmental and behavioral disorders , myopia , obesity , and a history of febrile seizures in childhood . using snp array and ngs , we identified a cryptic complex rearrangement that truncated 2 refseq genes : the protein coding gene celf4 ( also known as brunol4 ) at 18q12.2 and the non - coding rna loc643542 at 18q22.1 .
this report illustrates the utility of high - resolution genome - wide techniques in identifying neurodevelopmental genes .
we found celf4 to be disrupted in a patient with borderline iq , developmental and behavioral disorders , myopia , obesity , and a history of febrile seizures in childhood .
the translocation breakpoint at chromosome 18 was confirmed by pcr amplification and subsequent sanger sequencing of the breakpoint - spanning fragments that revealed a small sequence of micro homology ( agga ) , likely to facilitate the translocation ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
