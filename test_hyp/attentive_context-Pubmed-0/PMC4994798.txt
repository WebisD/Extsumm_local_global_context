our hypothesis is that a multiple component intervention called a copd self - management program ( smp - copd ) , led by a multidisciplinary team , could significantly reduce the use of health care resources and , in particular , the number of exacerbations requiring hospital care .
to sum up , after applying a self - management program in patients with advanced copd , there were fewer hospitalizations and a&e visits for exacerbation of the disease in the group that received the intervention .
quality of life ( copd assessment test ) showed a mean score of 15.25.9 in the cg and 13.66.9 in the ig ( p=0.286 ) . in the cg
this type of program can be an effective care tool adapted to the needs of chronic patients
the number of days of hospitalization for  respiratory cause  was also lower and the time to the first instance of hospital care longer . in terms of the consumption of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids during exacerbations , overall , the ig patients did not use more drugs to treat exacerbations than the cg ; antibiotic use by the ig was higher while glucocorticoid use was lower , but the differences were not significant .
