further studies with a larger cohort and modification of the surgical technique with a goal of reducing postoperative astigmatism and refining nomograms are suggested to determine the long - term safety and refractive effects on the cornea and establish the technique as a valid option to treat hyperopia .
the potential advantages of cryopreservation of refractive lenticules have been largely described for use in the same patient , in the event of future ectasia or presbyopia by restoring corneal volume.3 with the increasing number of eyes undergoing relex smile for myopia , and thus , the extracted lenticules as a by - product , it may be a novel idea to preserve these lenticules on a long - term basis using cryopreservation for potential future use and research .
the preliminary results of fili in hyperopia indicate that this may be a better technique than hyperopic lasik for moderate hyperopia in terms of stability , regression , aberrations , and postoperative dry eye .
following establishment of one such tissue bank , we wanted to explore the possibility of use of such cryopreserved refractive lenticules for potential treatment of hyperopia and study the feasibility , safety , efficacy , and reproducibility of this new treatment .
