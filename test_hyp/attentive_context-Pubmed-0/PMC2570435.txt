the aim of our study was therefore 
 as follows : to investigate the distribution of il-18 allele variants at 
 positions 607ca and 137gc within a population of healthy donors from 
 southwestern siberia , and the influence of these allele variants on the level 
 of il-18 production by their peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( mncs ) .
thus alleles 607c and 137 g are associated with the increase 
 of spontaneous production of il-18 and allele 137 g 
 increases spontaneous and stimulated production .
a study of the relationship between 
 il-18 gene promoter polymorphisms and the likelihood of developing oncological 
 diseases showed that women carrying the c allele in the 137 position of 
 the promoter are at greater risk of developing ovarian carcinoma . on the 
 basis of our results and data from the literature
studies of the association 
 between il-18 polymorphism and atopic asthma have revealed that the g allele at 
 the 137 position 
 leads to an elevated risk of disease development ; moreover , none of the 74 
 patients examined had the cc genotype , which according to our data is 
 associated with reduced il-18 production .
lps - stimulated production of il-18 by pbmc 
 from healthy donors is significantly greater in those carrying ca genotype at 
 the 607 position .
