to report two cases of femtosecond laser - assisted small incision deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty ( dlek ) for patients with corneal endothelial decompensation by fuchs dystrophy and glaucoma
femtosecond laser - assisted small incision dlek was safe and technically feasible in our cases ; however , further evaluation is required to determine long - term effects .
in case 1 , the graft was clear and compact without interface haze , orbscan showed smooth and regular corneal surface , specular microscopy was unremarkable without sign of corneal endothelial damage , and optical coherence tomography showed uniform graft well attached to recipient stroma with minimal interface reflection at 2 months postoperation . in case 2 , the graft was clear and compact with minimal interface haze at 1 month postoperation .
hopefully in the near future , we can use the femtosecond laser and perform both donor and recipient corneal lamellar dissection .
case 1 clinical results showed a clear and compact graft without interface haze at two months postoperation .
this procedure can be an attractive alternative to penetrating keratoplasty ( pkp ) in treating corneal endothelial diseases such as fuchs dystrophy and aphakic and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.13 - 15 the endothelial replacement technique via scleral incision was first described by melles and later modified by terry and ousley to ' deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty ' ( dlek).3,4 recent modification includes introducing the folded donor disc through the a small incision.6 one problem in performing dlek is the technical difficulty associated with manual lamellar dissection .
