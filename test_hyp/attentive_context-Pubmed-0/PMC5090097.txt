excessive inflammatory responses including the release of a cytokine storm and the activation of a large number of t cells are characteristics of early stage sepsis . in spite of their ability to kill pathogens , they are equally effective in inducing cell and tissue damage . on one hand , the cytokine storm could be protective by activating the host anti - inflammatory proresolving response .
anxa1-mediated gata-3 and t - bet might favor th1 differentiation through erk and akt pathway , reversing tendency characterized by th2 skewing of immunosuppression .
enhanced anti - inflammatory response , characterized by a large number of t cells apoptosis and decreased responsiveness to antigen / mitogen , leads to the immunosuppression .
on the other hand , during sepsis , the cytokine storm induces excessive activation induced t cell death ( aicd ) ; the cause of aicd is an aberration in the cell cycle program .
considering that erk and pkb / akt are two major downstream transcription factors of fprl-1 , we further investigated the role of fprl-1 signaling pathways in the regulation of anxa1 on gata-3 .
to explore the expression of anxa1 and/or gata-3 of the th0 , th1 , and th2 cells , immunofluorescence was carried out to confirm that anxa1 and gata-3 expression were located in cell nucleus and cytoplasm ( figure 1 ) . to determine the roles of overexpressed endogenous anxa1 in the balance between gata-3 and t - bet expression , two major transcriptional switches in th1/th2 differentiation
