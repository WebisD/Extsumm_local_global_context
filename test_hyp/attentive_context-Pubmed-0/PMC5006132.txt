, we hypothesized that the polymorphisms in soccs and roccs component and regulatory genes might contribute to genetic susceptibility to lung cancer . to test this hypothesis , we conducted a two - stage case - control study with a total of 2433 lung cancer cases and 2433 cancer - free controls to evaluate the effects of gene polymorphisms in the 9 selected genes related to soccs and roccs ( trpc1 , trpc3 , trpc4 , trpc6 , trpc7 , orai1 , orai2 , stim1 , and stim2 ) . to our knowledge , this is the first study to explore the associations between a comprehensive panel of polymorphisms in genes related to soccs and roccs and lung cancer risk , and to identify subgroups that would be more likely to have higher lung cancer risk .
our study provided evidence indicating that rs9547991 and rs978156 in trpc4 and rs11748198 in trpc7 were potentially susceptibility markers of lung cancer in chinese population .
