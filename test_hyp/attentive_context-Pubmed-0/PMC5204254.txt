the application of sodium dithionite increased phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene expression slightly for the 0.004 mol / l , remarkably for the 0.4 and the 40 mol / l , and led to enhanced biosynthesis of flavonoids the effects of na2s2o4 on flavonoids may be classified into two sets : flavone glycosides and aglucones .
the application of na2s2o4 increased pal gene expression slightly for the 0.004 mol / l , remarkably for the 0.4 and the 40 mol / l , furthermore last a long time [ figure 3 ] .
the glycosides with less activitie changed little at different stages , but the aglucones with more activities were remarkably elevated at the 1 day , then decreased to prevent reactive oxygen species reducing too much activities of polyphenol oxidase in the roots of scutellaria baicalensis .
based on this theory , organisms treated with na2s2o4 can be used as basic models for studying environment stress . furthermore , na2s2o4 has strong reducing ability , easily transforms into noxious nahso4 , and it is widely applied as the dechlorination agents in tap water , beer bottle disinfectant , bleaching agent , and food leavening agent .
the expression of pal , a rate - limited enzyme responsible for the synthesis of flavonoids , was markedly upregulated [ figure 3 ] , led to increased production of baicalin , wogonoside , baicalein , and wogonin [ figure 4 ] .
