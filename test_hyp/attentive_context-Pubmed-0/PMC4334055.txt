the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses .
after obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) .
thus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 )
furthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma .
of the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples ,
two hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model
