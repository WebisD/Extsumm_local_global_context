, we have tested the effects of oral angelica acutiloba kitagawa ( aak ) extract on a dss - induced colitis model .
, patients with uc manifested a significant reduction in the ratio of il-1 receptor antagonist to il-1 , which implies the augmented activation of il-1 system in uc . in a previous study using dss - induced model of colitis
, we demonstrated the effects of aak extract in a dss - induced acute colitis model .
low - dose ( 100  mg / kg / day ) administration of aak did exhibit signs of amelioration , but not to the same extent ( score 8  0.8 ) ( figure 4 ) . to evaluate the mitigative effects of aak on dss - mediated immune response , expression of inflammatory cytokines , inducible enzymes , matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) , and tight junction - related proteins
in the case of corticosteroids , 55% of patients end up in cessation of therapy as a result of recurring acne , facial swelling , and osteoporosis .
clinical response to standard therapy among uc patients is discrete , depending on the combination of factors that eventually led to the disease . despite recent advances in therapeutic regimen , a considerable portion of patients with uc still fail or lose response to conventional nonbiologic agents , which results in varied complications such as fibrostenosis that may require surgical intervention .
