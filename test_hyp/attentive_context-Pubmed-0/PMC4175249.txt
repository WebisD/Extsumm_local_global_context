the aim of this study was to analyze , through ergonomic analyses , those motions most used 
 by radiological technologists that can cause musculoskeletal disorders so that the results 
 can be utilized as the basis for diagnosis , classification and prevention of occupational 
 musculoskeletal disorders in radiological technologists .
the captured working postures were assessed and analyzed using the following ergonomic 
 assessment methods : the rapid entire body assessment ( reba ) , the rapid upper limb assessment 
 ( rula ) , the national institute for occupational safety and health lifting equation ( nle ) , 
 and the strain index ( si ) .
this study was conducted to analyze the working postures of radiological technologists so 
 that the results can be utilized for the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal 
 disorders . in this study ,
in this study , designed to assess the ergonomic risks of radiological technologists , a 
 field survey was conducted on august 1 and august 2 , 2013 , at a hospital located in 
 gangwon - do , republic of korea .
therefore , hospitals need to be educated 
 regarding the concept of musculoskeletal disorders , and this needs to followed by education 
 regarding prevention through use of correct working postures , exercise methods for 
 radiological technologists .
