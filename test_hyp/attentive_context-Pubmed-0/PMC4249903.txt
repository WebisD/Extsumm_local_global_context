in the present study , we described different ascs could be induced into hepatocyte lineage cells in different culture systems in vitro .
this paper firstly provides such a concise review focused on ascs biology and differentiates potential , indicating ascs might be an ideal seed cells in cell transplant therapy and tissue engineering .
recently , the adult stem cells ( ascs ) derived from various tissues , including bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells ( bmscs ) , adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells ( adscs ) , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) have been developed as new cell sources contributing to liver regeneration for their high efficiency of hepatogenic differentiation using simple procedures and no ethnic issues ( 710 ) . in the present study , we investigated whether ascs are the ideal seed cells for the liver regeneration from the followings : ascs biology , including isolation , culture , differentiation to hepatocytes , and the further role of ascs in cell therapy and tissue engineering
based on this progress , ascs transplantation might be a novel therapy for the severe liver diseases , and also will be ideal seed cells for liver tissue engineering .
