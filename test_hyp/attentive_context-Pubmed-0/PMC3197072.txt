some authors found an association between the size of the cerebral metastatic lesion from malignant melanoma and clinical parameters characteristic of tumor behavior .
it deals with specific issues regarding the level of evidence of chemotherapy , radiosurgery , surgical resection , whole brain radiotherapy , use of corticosteroids , and anticonvulsants in the treatment of brain metastases .
it is important that the clinician suspect of the possibility of cns metastasis in all patients with new neurological signs and previous primary melanoma lesion .
they classified the metastases from melanomas to their size : smaller than 1  cm ( group a ) , between 1 and 4  cm ( group b ) , and bigger than 4  cm ( group c ) , in order to assess the clinical course of the disease and predict the response to treatment .
         metastatic spread of tumor cells detached from melanoma into the central nervous system ( cns ) occurs haematogenically since lymphatic drainage is absent in the brain .
rather , brain metastases are likely to originate from a unique subpopulation of cells within the primary neoplasm .
group b lesions are the most common , independent of the site of the primary tumor , except for patients with rectal melanoma .
