the goal of this study was to evaluate the presence and distribution of fdcs and idcs in oral lymphomas .
the microenvironment determined by neoplastic lymphoid cells in oral lymphomas is responsible by the development and expression of dendritic cells types .
tsunoda , et al.24 used caldesmon to evaluate neoplastic follicles of follicular lymphoma and verified a difference in fdcs immunoexpression in follicular lymphomas grade i , ii and iii .
there is not statistical difference of the caldesmon+/fdcs and s100+/idcs quantification between bl and pblomt , and dlbcl and pblomt , respectively .
therefore , cell proliferation in oral lymphomas may be related to the appropriated microenvironment to development of dcs .
therefore , the finding of rare cd21+/cd35+/ fdcs is expected . using antibodies anti - cd21 and anti- cd35 ,
representative samples were diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl , n=17 ) ; plasmablastic lymphoma of the oral mucosa type ( pblomt , n=11 ) ; burkitt lymphoma ( bl , n=15 ) ; extranodal marginal zone b - cell lymphoma of mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue ( malt lymphoma , n=2 ) ; mantle cell lymphoma ( mcl , n=1 ) ; extranodal nk / t - cell lymphoma , nasal type ( etcl , n=3 ) , and peripheral t - cell lymphoma , unspecified ( ptcl , n=1 ) .
