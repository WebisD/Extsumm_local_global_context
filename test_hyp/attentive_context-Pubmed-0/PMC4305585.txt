thus , the purpose 
 of this study was to compare changes in lumbar re at different angles while standing and 
 re - standing and sitting and re - sitting in a subgroup of fp subjects with nsclbp .
we compared the lumbar repositioning error ( re ) according to different lumbar angles in a 
 flexion pattern ( fp ) subgroup of patients with non - specific chronic low back pain ( nsclbp ) . 

s system5 , 
 6 and was defined as subjects with pain 
 provoked by postures and movement - related flexion of the lumbar spine . in the fp subgroup
we also suggest that the measurement 
 method for lumbar res would be more effective while sitting using a flexion angle of 30 in 
 fp subjects .
the lumbar re increased significantly with flexion at 30 during sitting . upon sitting 
 upright , the lumbar re between sitting and re - sitting was significantly greater with a 
 flexion of 30 ( 5.13.7 ) than 15 ( 2.03.7 ) or with an extension of 15 ( 1.51.9 ) ( p < 
 0.05 ) .
our study showed increased re 
 immediately while sitting at a flexion angle of 30. we suggest that a higher lumbar flexion 
 angle may have a negative impact on lumbar positioning sense while in the sitting posture 
 than in the standing posture in fp subjects with nslbp .
