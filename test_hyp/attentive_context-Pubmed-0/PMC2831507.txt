the efforts made to comprehend the essence of disease and its causes have shaped the history of medicine . even today
here we can discern a cause and effect chain , which in particular offers the practicable perspectives of prophylaxis and treatment .  
up till the time that robert koch discovered more than a hundred years ago that anthrax was caused by a bacterium , raging epidemics were seen as an expression of god s curse . while it was possible to control plague and cholera , in addition to new epidemics such as hiv / aids and sars long - forgotten scourges like
today many of these epidemics and infections have been brought under control , but in intensive care medicine sepsis continues to be the chief nemesis and while we can not exactly define the situation , an infection is implicated in the case of the vast majority of patients who die here , or has indeed been the cause of death .   and here we come upon a fortuitous confluence of all the factors that facilitate microbial invasion of the human body .
but such spectacular pathogens account for only part of our problems ; the advances made in clinical medicine mean that today not only are we seeing patients with compromised immune systems , who in earlier times would have long succumbed to their underlying disease , but    that now such forms of immunosuppression induced , for instance , as a result of major surgery and organ transplants have become a serious problem in intensive care units .
