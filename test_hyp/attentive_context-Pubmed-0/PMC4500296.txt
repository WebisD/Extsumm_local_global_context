we present the case of a haemophiliac patient who was admitted as an emergency due to distended abdomen , nausea , vomiting and the clinical picture of ileus .
this unusual presentation of haemophilia with bleeding in the wall of the small intestine is very rare and has only been seen in a few cases in the world .
the native abdomen in a standing position presented air fluid levels with moderate distension of the accompanying bowel loops . a nasal probe was inserted and the symptoms of ileus disappeared , but after taking food by mouth , the picture of ileus returned .
the complications of intramural bleeding are acute intestinal obstruction , but also rupture of the haematoma in the lumen or the peritoneal space .
ct of the abdomen and pelvis was performed , which showed circular , high density thickening of the walls in places in the area of the jejunum , indicating haemorrhage , but also the formation of haematoma in the wall structure . after administering factor viii , the symptoms of ileus ceased , and the patient recovered completely .
ct diagnosis defined the cause of the obstruction and saved the patient from an unnecessary surgical procedure .
