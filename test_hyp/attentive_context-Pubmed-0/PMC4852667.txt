we performed globus pallidus internus ( gpi ) dbs on 25 patients with drug - resistant ts and conducted follow - up assessments of 24 of the patients for over 1 year .
, all patients had significantly improved symptoms and 56% of patients had a significant decrease in ygtss scores compared with the baseline ( p < 0.01 ) . at the 12-month follow - up
twenty - five patients with refractory ts were admitted to our hospital for treatment between september 2007 and august 2014 . following the electrode placement surgery ,
subsequently , researchers have attempted the use of dbs for the treatment of ts with various targets .
since 1995 , researchers have been working toward the use of stereotactic surgery in the treatment of ts . in 1999 , bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) was first applied in the treatment of ts with substantial efficacy .
the mean preoperative scores from the wais - rc were as follows : the verbal intelligence quotient ( viq ) was 98.04  7.87 , the performance - iq ( piq ) was 99.21  7.26 , and the full - iq ( fiq ) was 98.30  6.74 . at the 12-month follow - up assessment , the mean viq , piq , and fiq scores were 100.08  7.71 , 99.29  7.32 , and 99.88  7.21 , respectively .
