the present case report is unique as it shows presentation of adenoid cystic carcinoma as a solitary ulcer on the floor of the mouth rather than the classical nodular swelling .
adenoid cystic carcinoma was first described by billroth in 1859 and called " cylindroma " due to its characteristic histologic appearance1 . in 1953 ,
a 56-year - old male patient presented with a chief complaint of an ulcer in the left floor of the mouth for one week .
the present case differs from usual cases of adenoid cystic carcnioma with respect to site and presentation , making it a rare entity .
adenoid cystic carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumour characterized by a deceptive histologic pattern , indolent , locally invasive growth with high propensity for perineural invasion , local recurrence and distant metastasis .
thus , the aim of this article is to emphasise that though the literature states that adenoid cystic carcinoma ulcerates the superficial lesional mucosa , it can also present as an ulcerative lesion .
it is defined by the world health organization as " a basaloid tumour consisting of epithelial and myoepithelial cells in various morphological configurations , including tubular , cribriform and solid patterns .
