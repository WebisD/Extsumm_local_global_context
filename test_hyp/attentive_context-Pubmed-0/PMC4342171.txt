in conclusion , the ingestion of a pure protein load does not seem to have a clinically significant impact on glucose levels in adult t1 dm patients treated with insulin pumps .
the aim of this study was to estimate the impact of ingestion of a pure protein load on glucose levels in t1 dm patients treated with personal insulin pumps .
here , for the first time , we evaluated the impact of the ingestion of a pure protein load on glucose levels in adult t1 dm subjects treated with insulin pumps . in this short - term clinical experiment
the glucose variability assessed by cgms - based standard deviation of mean glucose levels was 36.4 and 38.9  mg / dl for phase i and phase ii , respectively ( p = 0.01 ) .
mean maximal glucose levels were 146.4 and 145.2  mg / dl for phase i and phase ii , respectively ( p = 0.85 ) .
glucose patterns were recorded during 6 hours of phase i ( fasting ) and 6 hours of phase ii ( protein load ) .
mean baseline glucose levels were 119.8 and 117.6  mg / dl for phase i and phase ii , respectively ( p = 0.68 ) .
