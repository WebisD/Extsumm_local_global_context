males and females showed significant response to milkweed florets , a pentane extract , and a synthetic blend of the extract s six major constituents : benzaldehyde , ( e)--ocimene , benzyl alcohol , phenylacetaldehyde , nonanal , and ( e)-2-nonenal .
mauer and rowley ( 1999 ) determined the headspace profile of common milkweed flower to be predominantly 2-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol ; however , they found that a synthetic blend of these two compounds was not attractive to c. pipiens . due to the multiple demonstrations of c. pipiens attraction to milkweed , both in the laboratory and the field , we used a solvent extract of the flower as a potential model for synthetic mosquito lures .
a positive upwind orientation by c. pipiens to floret volatiles of a. syriaca was demonstrated in this study , suggesting a new potential source of attractants for use in the field as lures .
40  % of all antennal olfactory receptors of c. quinquefasciatus were acutely sensitive to nonanal , and it produced a synergistic effect on trap catch when presented with co2 .
