we compared blood and vitreous levels of vegf , ua , and protein between the two study groups and describe their correlation with the changes seen in oct .
the aim of our study was to analyse the vitreous and serum of diabetic patients with dme and severe npdr and compare them to nondiabetic controls .
, we found that increased concentration of intravitreal vegf in patients with npdr and cystoid dme correlated with increase of cube volume calculated by cirrus hd - oct . since dme usually affects the macular area and not only the foveal region , the assessment of the vegf concentration in clinical practice using the cube volume is comprehensible .
the crt of dm subjects also correlated significantly with the cv (  = 0.581 , p = 0.018 ) .
further , among all oct parameters , only cv correlated significantly with the concentration of vitreous vegf in the dm group (  = 0.515 , p = 0.041 ) .
furthermore , we found that the cv measured with cirrus hd - oct correlate significantly with the concentration of vegf in the vitreous of patients with npdr and dme . in our earlier study , we showed that the levels of intravitreal ua correlated significantly with the degree of dr   and recently also serum ua concentration has been found to be associated with increase in severity of dr .
