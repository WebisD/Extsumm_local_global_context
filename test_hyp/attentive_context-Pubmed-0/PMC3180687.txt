selenium levels were 0.62% lower for every 5 years of older age ( 95% ci : 0.29 , 0.96 ) , and were 6.3% lower in women vs. men ( 95% ci : 4.9 , 7.6 ) .
our main aims were to determine   the major independent dietary predictors of selenium levels ; whether lifestyle and demographic factors that might influence oxidative stress , such as age , smoking , adiposity , physical activity , and alcohol use , are independent predictors of selenium levels after adjusting for diet , and   whether significant geographic variation would remain after accounting for differences in diet , demographic , and lifestyle factors .
finally , although we identified a number of independent determinants of selenium - providing critical information for future studies examining selenium levels and chronic disease - a large proportion of the total variance was left unexplained .
those living in the west , midwest - north , and south had significantly higher toenail selenium levels ( west : 8.9% higher , 95% ci : 7.2 , 10.6 ; northern midwest : 7.4% higher , 95% ci : 5.5 , 9.4 ; and south : 2.8% higher , 95% ci : 0.9 , 4.7 ) .
