the significant prevalence and severity of nonpain symptoms among new and follow - up cancer patients seen in a pc outpatient clinic emphasizes the need for comprehensive assessment and routinely audited symptom management plans .
despite the wide variation in reports that explored symptom pattern and prevalence in patients with advanced cancer , it is clear that they all agree upon the fact that patients with advanced cancer are polysymptomatic .
this paper aims at determining the prevalence and severity of 10 nonpain symptoms in cancer patients visiting the pc outpatient clinic at kfshrc , riyadh , sa .
however , when patients with primary or secondary lung or pleural disease were pooled in one group , they had higher mean severity scores of shortness of breath compared with other patients , 2.4 and 1.2 , respectively ( p = 0.01 ) . symptom prevalence and severity
the mean severity scores were highest for tiredness ( 5.1 ) and loss of appetite ( 5 ) and lowest for nausea and confusion ( 3.4 each ) as shown in table 2 .
the mean number of symptoms was higher in patients with pps of less than 70% ( 5.9  1.9 ) as compared with those who had better performance status ( 4.6  2.3 ) ( p = 0.002 ) .
