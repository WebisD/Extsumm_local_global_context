the information generated from the genome projects will be of the greatest value if it can be converted into functional data , particularly if this increases our understanding of normal gene function and allows strategies to be developed for prevention and treatment of human disease .
this paper will focus on the rise of recombineering as the major homologous recombination - mediated approach for bac modifications , as well as its novel applications and future prospects in the art of genetic tinkering .
coli species ( e.g. , vibrio cholera     , yersinia pseudotuberculosis , and pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , as well as the successful transfers of phage dna - modifying enzymes ( e.g. , phic31      and cre - loxp     ) from traditional hosts ( e. coli ) to mammalian cells   are encouraging signs that their adaptation for use in eukaryotic systems is not too far from becoming reality .
bac homologous recombination technologies have benefited the research community in ways unimaginable only decades before . from microbiology , virology to human genetics , neuroscience , and proteomics , the power to clone and manipulate large pieces of intact genetic information with high fidelity has enabled researchers to design and conduct insightful studies in their respective fields .   with recombineering being increasingly applied in creative ways , the only limiting factor for the potential of recombineering
