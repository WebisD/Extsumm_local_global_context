, we report a case of plch with multiple nodules without cysts throughout the lungs .

langerhans ' cell histiocytosis ( lch ) is a proliferative disease characterized by monoclonal proliferation and the infiltration of organs with langerhans ' cells .
plch is a rare disorder found in only 5% of biopsy - confirmed interstitial lung disease .
nodular lesions are predominant in the early stage of plch and progress to cystic lesions in later stages of the disease . in korea , multiple cystic lesions are the main radiological findings of plch , and no cases with multiple nodular lesions without cysts have been reported . here
localized forms of lch in bone have been referred to as eosinophilic granuloma since lichtenstein first described them in 1940 .
this case involved a young male who currently smoked and had multiple pulmonary nodules , which were suspicious of metastasis .
the term " pulmonary langerhans ' cell histiocytosis ( plch ) " was first coined by farinacci in 1951   and refers to disease in adults that affects the lungs , either in isolation or in addition to other organ systems .
