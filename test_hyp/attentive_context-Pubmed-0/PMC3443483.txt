most importantly , we focus on the role of specific pathways which are needed to restore and maintain proteostasis during aging and their interplay with a special focus on impaired proteostasis in ad , which may add to a novel view and understanding of ad pathogenesis .
our discussion presented here attempts to integrate two major factors that are associated with neurodegeneration , protein homeostasis and aging .
alzheimer s disease ( ad ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder starting with mild memory loss and manifesting in severe cognitive decline .
positional cloning studies of familial ad ( fad ) cases have identified mutations in three genes , amyloid precursor protein ( app ) , presenilin 1 and 2 ( ps1 , ps2 ) , which are tightly linked to the generation of a peptides .
. a better understanding of how the proteostasis network is regulated might help to identify targets which lead to prevention of the deleterious loss of neuronal cells and tissue in ad .
today , we know that the progressive deposition of misfolded and aggregation - prone proteins in defined regions of the nervous system is not unique to ad , but a well - described characteristic of several neurodegenerative disorders , including parkinson s disease ( pd ) , huntington s disease ( hd ) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) . recently , it has been proposed that the accumulation of disease - relevant proteins in aggregates might actually even be considered as a protective mechanism to dispose these proteins and remove them from the cellular metabolism   . generally , within the crowded cellular environment
