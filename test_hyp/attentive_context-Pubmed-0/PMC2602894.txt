we speculate that this could represent an important 
  physiological role of g6b - b and other platelet itim proteins in helping to 
  prevent platelet activation in vivo .
these results are 
  consistent with a model in which cross - linking of gpvi by collagen leads to 
  tyrosine phosphorylation of the fcr -chain and activation of the 
  tyrosine kinase syk .
in summary , the present study reports that both fcr -chain and 
  clec-2 generate weak , sustained constitutive signals that are inhibited by 
  co - expression with g6b - b .
pecam-1 does not inhibit constitutive signaling in dt40 
  cells  a similar set of studies were undertaken to investigate 
  whether the major platelet itim receptor , pecam-1 , also inhibits constitutive 
  and agonist - induced activation of nfat downstream of gpvi - fcr -chain 
  and clec-2 .
constitutive signaling of gpvi - fcr -chain in dt40 
  cells  we set out to extend our previous characterization of the 
  gpvi - fcr -chain signaling pathway in the dt40 b cell line 
  ( 24 ) by testing whether 
  activation of gpvi by collagen is dependent on its associated fcr 
  -chain .
the ability of g6b - b to inhibit constitutive and agonist - induced responses 
  mediated through gpvi - fcr -chain and clec-2 was further investigated in 
  the combined absence of the two sh2 domain - containing tyrosine phosphatases , 
  shp1 and shp2 , or in the absence of the 5-inositol phosphatase , ship .
