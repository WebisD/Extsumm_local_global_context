, we have also developed signaling pathways on leptin   receptor activator for nuclear factor  b ligand ( rankl )   and follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ) . in the current study , we have generated a reaction map of tweak signaling pathway , which is available for visualization at netslim   ( http://www.netpath.org/netslim/ ) , an accessory resource for visualization of netpath pathways .
our current work , which incorporates the tweak - signaling pathway data into  netpath  , would open avenues for further studies of tweak - associated proteins and related disorders , such as cancers and autoimmune diseases . to our understanding , this study compiles for the first time tweak induced signaling events ; these include ( i ) the inactivation of gsk3  followed by dissociation of  -catenin1 , ( ii ) the proapoptotic nature of tweak mediated through the expression of tnf , which further leads to the activation of caspase8 , and ( iii ) the association between tweak and ciap proteins ( 1 and 2 )   .
our compiled data will be useful for the scientific community to explore , further , the role of tweak in differential disease pathogenesis , in biomarker development . using similar approach
