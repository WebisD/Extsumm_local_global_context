we discuss here a rare clinical presentation which helps in better depict this rare genodermatosis and on the lack of correlation between phenotype and genotype in this disease .
x - linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata ( cdpx2 , omim 302960 ) is an inheritable systemic disease and is characterized by skeletal , ophthalmologic , and cutaneous manifestations . in the late seventies , rudolph happle reported a female and brilliantly recognized a group of published patients with chondrodysplasia punctata whose mosaic phenotype and sex rate corresponded with an x - linked dominant pattern of inheritance . in 1999 , the gene emopamil binding protein ( ebp ) was identified and associated with cdpx2 , so called conradi - hnermann - happle syndrome .
while cdpx2 may exhibit variable phenotypes , psoriasiform skin lesions are exceptional and histopathologic investigations of psoriasiform skin lesions show epidermal hyperproliferation in addition to ichthyotic retention hyperkeratosis . in this report , a case of a 12-year - old girl diagnosed with x - linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata with a psoriasiform phenotype is reported with genetical confirmation .
a 12-year - old girl , who had been born with congenital erythroderma , had a 4-month history of linear and whorled inflammatory cutaneous lesions on her trunk , leg , and arms .
