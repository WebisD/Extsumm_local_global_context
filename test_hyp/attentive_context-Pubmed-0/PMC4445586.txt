we called this new paradigm a brain - machine - brain interface ( bmbi , figure 1 ) .
as the bmi field rose to the forefront of modern neuroscience , the possibility of establishing a bidirectional dialogue between brains and artificial devices was also realized . in 2011 , through a technique called cortical electrical microstimulation , my laboratory was able to deliver simple  tactile messages  directly into the brains of monkeys .
we are currently investigating what kinds of social behaviors and global patterns of neuronal activity emerge when groups of animal brains are allowed to collaborate directly , through the employment of different types of brain - to - brain interfaces .
the central task of each of these animal brainets is to optimize the combination of neuronal activity , sampled from multiple brains simultaneously , into a supranervous system that is responsible for attaining a common behavioral goal , such as identifying a complex tactile pattern or moving an elaborate virtual limb .
this international team joined with a brazilian multidisciplinary rehabilitation team , composed of physicians , psychologists , and physical therapists , to take on a very ambitious project : designing and implementing the first bipedal robotic exoskeleton whose movements could be controlled directly by human - brain activity .
