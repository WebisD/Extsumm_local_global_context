, we aimed to summarize recent advances in pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategies in the setting of aosd .
taken together , these findings support the contributory role of several immune mediators in aosd pathogenesis allowing the determination of rational treatment approaches . while current evidence identifies il-1 blockade as a major therapeutic strategy in patients with refractory aosd , inhibition of il-6 , il-17 , or il-18 molecules holds significant promises .
adult - onset still 's disease ( aosd ) is a rare inflammatory disease of unknown etiology , which commonly affects young adults .
given the complex and multifaceted nature of aosd , carefully designed clinical studies aimed to associate distinct clinical phenotypes with specific pathogenetic pathways would allow the designation of tailored therapies for distinct disease aspects .
treatment of patients with aosd includes nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , corticosteroids , and disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs ( dmards ) , while our better understanding of disease pathophysiology allowed the identification of biological agents as important targeted therapies   .  
recent studies have added valuable information in regard to the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of aosd . besides , the exact pathogenesis remains largely elusive , with genetic , environmental , and immunologic contributors being implicated . in the present paper
