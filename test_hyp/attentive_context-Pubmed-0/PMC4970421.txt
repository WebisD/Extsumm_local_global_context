this study aims to determine the usefulness of mandibular ramus as an aid in sex determination .
a short retrospective study was conducted of sixty males and sixty females , using orthopantomographs which were taken using kodak 8000c digital panoramic and cephalometric system ( 73 kvp , 12 ma , 13.9 s ) .
maximum ramus breadth , condylar height , and projective height of ramus were statistically significant with p < 0.05 as shown in table 2 .
descriptive statistics sex was accurately determined in 32 cases out of sixty male mandibular measurements with prediction accuracy rate of 53% , and sex was accurately determined in 36 cases out of sixty female mandibular measurements with an accuracy rate of 60% [ table 3 ] .
sex was accurately determined in 44 cases out of 55 male mandibles with an accuracy rate of 80% , and sex was accurately determined in 35 cases out of 49 female mandibles with accuracy rate of 71% . in our study ,
sex was accurately determined in 32 cases out of sixty male mandibular measurements with prediction accuracy rate of 53% and sex was accurately determined in 36 cases out of sixty female mandibular measurements with accuracy rate of 60% .
