moreover , studies in human sle showed that the clinical response obtained by treatment of patients with rituximab , a b cell depleting anti - cd20 antibody ,   preceded autoantibody decline , thus supporting the autoantibody - independent role of b cells in sle process .    a more detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying the sle - associated tissue damaging - immune response revealed that interactions between t and b cells are essential in the development of this disease and that cytokines are key mediators of this interplay .
systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course .
however ,   both the ability of this cytokine to regulate in vitro and in vivo immunological pathways that are relevant in sle and the evidence obtained in murine models of sle   suggest that il-21 could play an important role in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies and end - organ damage in this disease . therefore , it is tempting to speculate that inhibitors of il-21 could be useful   to attenuate lupus - related clinical manifestations .
however , because of the redundant functions of cytokines , a major challenge for scientists is to identify key molecule(s ) which can profoundly alter the outcome of sle - associated inflammatory response . here
