there was family history of postpartum psychosis in his mother , which is associated with a family history of bipolar disorder and the index case had been diagnosed as mania 3 years ago with complete remission in the interval period .
this case is unusual in that age of onset of mania is very late ( 75 years ) and during the current second episode we could not find any organic etiology .
hence , aripiprazole may be a safe and effective antipsychotic medication for the control of mania in the elderly .
its efficacy has been proven as monotherapy in treating acute mania and in prophylaxis of bipolar disorder .
occurrence of first episode of mania in the elderly ( after 60 years age ) warrants a high index of suspicion for organic causes .
it is possible that the manic episodes were the initial manifestations of ftd in this patient and this will be tested only in the follow - up .
a 78-year - old person , retired as school teacher with no history of any substance abuse or medical history .
hence , we chose aripiprazole for our patient in view of his already prolonged qtc interval and age of 78 years .
