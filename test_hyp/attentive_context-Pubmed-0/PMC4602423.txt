the aims of this study were 3-fold : to establish normal performance ranges for each of the novel tests in nondisabled participants , to evaluate the reliability of each of the novel tests , and to assess the strength of association between individual test outcomes and body mass . in relation to the final aim , a sufficiently strong relationship with body size would indicate that , prior to applying these methods in classification , it may be necessary to develop body - size scaling methods that can be validly applied to measures obtained from athletes with neuromusculoskeletal impairments .
correlations were moderate and significant for 6 of the 7 tests in males ( r  =  0.430.61 , p  =  0.000 ) and 2 of the 7 tests in females ( r  =  0.300.33 , p  =  0.0140.03 ) .
key features of the battery were that measures were isometric and therefore , according to theory , less training responsive than other dynamic strength tests ; instrumented , yielding an outcome measure in newtons ( a ratio scale ) ; comprehensive , assessing all muscle actions of importance in the key disciplines of paralympic athletics ( wheelchair racing , running , throwing , and jumping ) ; and parsimonious , by assessing compound ( or multijoint actions ) and thereby minimizing the number of tests required and ensuring that individual tests accounted for the greatest possible variance in performance .
