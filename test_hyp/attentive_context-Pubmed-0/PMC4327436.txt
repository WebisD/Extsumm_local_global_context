 table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of apical leakage observed for the experimental groups , namely 0.44 mm for group i ( lysanda+iodoform ) , 0.46 mm for group 11 ( lysanda + iodoform + calcium hydroxide ) , 0.48 mm for group v ( mta ) , 0.68 mm for group iv ( lysanda+zinc oxide ) , and 0.77 mm for group iii ( lysanda + iodoform + zinc oxide ) .
the teeth were randomly divided into five groups of 10 teeth each and submitted to root - end filling with the following test materials : group i  lysanda paste with iodoform ; group ii 
dutra and horta11 ( 1994 ) analyzing root - end fillings in dog 's teeth , confirmed the high effectiveness of lysanda paste compared to amalgam .
lysanda paste with iodoform showed the lowest leakage , without statistically significant difference compared to other groups ; 3 .
lysanda paste with iodoform and zinc oxide ; group iv -lysanda paste with zinc oxide ; and group v  mta . in group
procedures for group ii were the same as performed for group i , with addition of 0.22 g of iodoform and 0.11 g of calcium hydroxide . in group iii ,
