, we tested the immunogenicity potential of naltrexone alone or in mixture with alum as an adjuvant against heat - killed l. major promastigotes in the susceptible balb / c mice .
to our awareness , this study is the first evaluation for using an alum naltrexone mixture as an adjuvant for vaccination .
1 , the mean level of mtt in the mice immunized with al ntx  vac and ntx  vac induced significantly higher lymphocyte proliferation comparing to the control group ( p < 0.001and p < 0.01 , respectively ) .
immunization with the alum naltrexone mixture as an adjuvant , in combination with the autoclaved l. major promastigotes antigens , can enhance cellular immunity and shift the immune responses to a th1 pattern .
the mice of ntx- vac group produced the highest amounts of il-5 but ifn- to il-5 ratio was higher in al - ntx- vac group , none of them proofed as significant ( table 1 ) . to assess cell - mediated responses to parasite antigens in vivo
therefore , follow - up studies are needed to elucidate the effect of naltrexone on the mice immune system and to examine adjuvant activity of naltrexone when combined with vaccines against other microorganisms .
