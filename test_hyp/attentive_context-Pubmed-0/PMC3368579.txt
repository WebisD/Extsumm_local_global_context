  it is well established that folic acid supplementation has a role in the treatment of psoriasis in conjunction with methotrexate treatment .
links with alterations in levels of folate and homocysteine in patients with psoriasis have also been implicated in contributing to the propagation of atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic events   .
however , the evidence to support its use in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease by directly impacting on plasma homocysteine levels is lacking .
now management of associated risk factors such as obesity , dyslipidemia , and hypertension as well as encouraging smoking cessation are paramount for these patients as is , of course , the management of their skin .
indeed they also found psoriasis to be an independent risk factor for mortality ( or , 1.86 ; 95% ci , 1.562.21 ) as a result of the association with atherosclerosis .  
these risk factors in combination with the chronic inflammatory process are thought to be significant components in the development of vascular disease   .
psoriasis has very significant psychosocial morbidity which appears independent of objective disease severity   .
it is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality   . indeed patients with psoriasis have almost twice the risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with normal controls   .
