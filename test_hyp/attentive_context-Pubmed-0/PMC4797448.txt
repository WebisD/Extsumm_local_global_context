we present a case of interstitial pneumonitis caused by parasitic infestation , which was diagnosed on transbronchial lung biopsy ( tblb ) .
a 54-year - old female presented with a history of exertional breathlessness and dry cough for two months .
bronchoscopy and transbronchial lung biopsy can be useful in the diagnosis of diffuse lung infiltrates .
with increasing travels and worldwide migration , parasitic infections should be considered in differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases particularly in the evaluation of diffuse lung infiltrates .
the diagnosis of parasitic diseases of the respiratory system is challenging because clinical manifestation and radiological findings are not specific .
the larvae can cause airway inflammation , whereas migration of the mature adult worm may cause mechanical obstruction .
high - resolution computed tomography chest showing multiple ill - defined centrilobular opacities with ground glass opacities bilaterally before treatment histopathology image of transbronchial lung biopsy showing calcified larva with thickened alveolar septa with mild lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate in the interstitium high - resolution computed tomography chest showing remarkable improvement after treatment
the technique is useful in patients with suspected lung cancer , fungal and mycobacterial lung infections , unexplained infiltrates in immunocompromised hosts and in patients with suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis , lymphangitic carcinomatosis , and in selected cases of pulmonary langerhan 's cell histiocytosis , lymphangioleiomyomatosis , and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia .
