, the nlrp3 inflammasome has been shown to possess the function of regulating the maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- ( il- ) 1. in previous work , we found that augmented secretion of il-1 in rats suffering from trauma - induced pancreatitis was substantially depressed by the treatment of hrs , which implies a possibility that hrs is able to inhibit the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome , thereby contributing to the suppression of il-1 production .
we found that , although hrs failed to suppress plasma pancreatic enzymes activity , it significantly attenuated the pancreatic damage in mice in response to the induction of pancreatitis , together with the impaired nlrp3 inflammasome activity , suggesting that the potential of hrs to block the nlrp3 inflammasome activation was probably involved in the amelioration of pancreatic injury .
thus , the herein study extended previous studies to evaluate the potential of hrs to inhibit nlrp3 inflammasome activation , which probably mediated the protective activity of hrs against experimental ap .
, our work has , for the first time , revealed that hrs can act as an antagonist of nlrp3 inflammasome resulting in attenuation of cellular inflammatory processes and consequently relieve the pancreatic injury during ap .
