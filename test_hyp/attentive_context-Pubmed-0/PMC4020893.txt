this paper describes the study design and feasibility in a population that is difficult to research in adequate number.20
the icepac study represents a comprehensive , interdisciplinary approach to understanding the autonomic and psychophysiologic characteristics of ic / bps .
the study aims to define autonomic , psychological , and other ic / bps comorbid disorders , evaluate associated changes in autonomic and sensory nervous system structure and function , and characterize stress response physiology .
this report describes the design , implementation , and feasibility of the interstitial cystitis : elucidation of psychophysiologic and autonomic characteristics ( icepac ) study .
the major obstacles have been by - products of the different perspectives and areas of expertise that a diverse group of investigators has brought , which , interestingly has also been one of the study s greatest strengths .
that is , as perspectives have been shared and a common approach has been forged , each specialty has benefited by the input of the others .
typical symptoms and findings support this hypothesis ( table 1 ) , and suggest ic / bps is better conceptualized as either a chronic pain disorder , one involving autonomic nervous system dysfunction , or a combination of both .
