we report this case to highlight the possibility to administer anti tnf- treatment in psoriatic patients affected by concomitant b - cll .
b - cll is the first example of an indolent cancer characterized by abnormally low apoptosis rather than increased mitosis . although multiple apoptosis inhibiting factors other than tnf- have been identified in b - cll , several data indicate that tnf- is a central mediator in apoptosis resistance of malignant lymphocytes in b - cll .
on the basis of this evidence , tnf- could represent a therapeutic target in patients affected by both psoriasis and b - cll ; specific inhibition of tnf- , either with dimeric fusion protein etanercept or the monoclonal antibody infliximab , could potentially result in the control of proliferation of the leukemic clone .
here , we have described the case of a patient suffering from plaque psoriasis and b - cll .
a 41-year - old white woman , suffering from plaque psoriasis since she was 23 years old , was referred to our outpatient clinic .
psoriasis is a chronic immunologically - based inflammatory skin disease which affects approximately 2% of the general population   .
b - cll is the most common form of leukemia in the western world , characterized by the slow and progressive accumulation of monoclonal cd5 + b lymphocytes in peripheral blood , bone marrow , lymph nodes and other organs .
