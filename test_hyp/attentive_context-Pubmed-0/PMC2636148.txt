a 27-year - old malay male patient presented two weeks 
 after alkali splashed into his left eye while working . prior to 
 reporting to us , the patient consulted a general practitioner 
 who prescribed some topical eye drops ( details of the 
 treatment were not available ) and the eye condition worsened . 

slit - lamp examination revealed a large central corneal perforation 
 ( 4  5 mm ) with surrounding stromal thinning involving two- 
 thirds of the cornea without any signs of infection . in order to maintain the shape of the eyeball and due to the 
 problem of non - availability of donor cornea
a gentle b - scan ruled out any posterior 
 segment abnormality . a clinical diagnosis of left corneal ulcer with limbal ischemia 
 secondary to alkali injury with secondary infection was made . 

efficacy of amt alone or with glue in treating small corneal 
 perforation has been well established but found unable to 
 promote corneal stability in patients with severe corneal 
 thinning and therefore , an additional urgent tectonic procedure 
 has to be undertaken.3 non - availability of donor cornea poses 
 a considerable problem in some countries .
conjunctival flap is unlikely to seal large corneal perforations 
 associated with corneal melting following chemical injury .
