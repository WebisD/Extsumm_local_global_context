, we developed a method to quantify outflow enhancement from plasma - mediated ait and show that nasal ablation of trabecular meshwork increased outflow not only locally but circumferentially .
here we address both with a differential canalography technique that allows examination of the effect of trabectome - mediated ait on focal outflow in porcine eyes .
in contrast , flow rate changes from pre- to post - ait were more substantial in the nasal quadrants ( fig .
visualization of the chamber angle and ablation of tm by ait was quite similar to surgery in human patients .
with the exception of eye 1 , all eyes post - ait showed an initial uptake centered on the in and sn quadrants as expressed by the red color coding that spreads circumferentially from here ( fig .
we provide a heatmap summary image that combines fluorescence and flow rate of all six eyes .
ait led to increased flow and peak fluorescence in all quadrants , beyond the nasal site where ait was performed .
this allows us to visualize how flow can be enhanced in nonglaucomatous eyes to levels above the physiological flow rate and beyond the tm ablation area . in this constant pressure perfusion system ,
