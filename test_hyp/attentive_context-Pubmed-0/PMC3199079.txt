alternatively , the development of a pathology could be accelerated by crossing a-tg models with a rapid onset of a pathology , such as 5xfad mice with apoe - tr mice .
alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common form of dementia and represents a serious economic and social burden worldwide .
the continued development and characterization of both apoe and apoe / a-tg mouse models is critical to understanding the apoe - isoform effects on ad pathology .
transgenic models such as these provide tractable models for identifying biomarkers and the efficient initial validation of therapeutic targets .
, several transgenic ( tg ) mouse models have been developed to assess the structural and functional interactions between apoe and a. however , each of these models has potential drawbacks that affect the interpretation and physiological relevance of the results .
this temporal delay restricts the usefulness of the current apoe / a-tg mice for investigating the process of a accumulation and the resulting neurotoxicity . to accelerate a deposition ,
the familial form of ad ( fad ) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations that increase levels of the 42 amino acid isoform of the amyloid - beta 42 ( a42 ) peptide   . the primary genetic risk factor for ad is inheritance of the apoe4 gene for apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) , compared to apoe3 , with apoe2 reducing risk   .
