 dexmedetomidine in patients with spinal operation is associated with lower postoperative pain score and intraoperative bleeding ; hemodynamic effects are also significantly better in the dex group . 

this study was designed to compare the effect of dex as an analgesic and sedative drug with remifentanil as an adjuvant drug in anesthesia regiment in spinal operation . 


 although in this present study the mean blood pressure ( bp ) and heart rate ( hr ) revealed significant difference in both drugs , dex had a significant lowering impact on intra - operative bp and hr compared to remifentanil .
the mean of blood pressure ( p = 0.005 ) and heart rate ( p<0.001 ) had significant changes in patients who received remifentanil and dex as study intervention compared to the baseline time . in the study patients ,
the mean of post - extubation pain score of patients in the remifentanil group was significantly higher than the patients in the dex group ( 0.42.1 vs. 0.31.8 ; p=0.03 ) .

 in the present randomized clinical trial with a parallel design , 60 patients in the age range of 15 - 65 years who were candidates for posterior spinal fusion operation were included .
