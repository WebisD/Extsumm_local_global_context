the who green page questionnaire has not yet been analyzed in terms of its practical 
 utility with respect to medical diagnostics . the expected goal of this research was to assess the possibility of implementation of the 
 who green page as a tool to supplement basic medical interviews with potential environmental 
 health risk factors for children and determination of real risk factors currently existing 
 in home and school environments .
the questionnaire may prove to be a useful tool in determining the kind of potential 
 environmental risk factors that exist in children s living and study places .
this picture is positive and does not fully correspond with reality from the hygienic point 
 of view and after performing an environmental interview , which emphasizes people s low awareness of environmental 
 risks .
the who green page questionnaire was designed as a potential tool to determine and monitor 
 children s environmental conditions in all places where they live and develop .
domestic animals were present around the homes of 74.5% ( 117 ) of the respondents , and the 
 distribution of answers was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) , as it relates to the 
 child s place of living .
the caregivers expressed minor concerns 
 about the children s living and study environments as well as low knowledge and awareness of 
 existing environmental risks .
