the double facial nerve trunk emerged from the stylomastoid foramen and petrotympanic fissure was found in a 65-yr - old caucasian male cadaver during a routine dissection course .
surgeons should be aware of the possible anatomical variations of the trunk of the facial nerve , because a trunk of the facial nerve exiting from the petrotympanic fissure may also be present .
knowledge of the trunk of the facial nerve is essential for preserving the nerve during surgical procedures of the mastoid process , parotid gland , the cranial base and the facial nerve ( 13 , 17 ) . in this study , we exposed exit point of the trunk of the facial nerve through the cranium .
the branches arising from the rami form to parotid plexus in parotid gland . the superior buccal nerve arising from temporofacial ramus and the inferior buccal nerve arising from the cervicofacial ramus form to the buccal plexus without parotid gland ( 1 ) . the zygomatic ( 2 ) , the marginal mandibular ( 3 - 5 ) , the buccal ( 6 ) , and the temporal branches ( 7 ) of the facial nerve were investigated by many researchers . different surgical approaches and landmarks to the trunk of the facial nerve have been reported ( 8 - 12 ) .
