primary malignant tumors of the spine are rare.123 the treatment of metastatic spinal tumors has evolved significantly with greater understanding of molecular biology of the tumors and advances made in the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.456 high grade metastatic spinal tumors are invasive and without timely treatment , patients can succumb to progression of their disease.7 despite being an invasive and morbid surgery , current evidence suggests that only total enbloc spondylectomy ( tes ) with free tumor margins in selected cases has better survival rates.89 with this background , the authors describe their results of tes for solitary high grade metastatic spinal tumors with 18 months followup .
the present series shows favorable short term results of tes for solitary , metastatic , high grade vertebral body tumors by a team approach .
five patients underwent tes for solitary metastatic vertebral lesion between november 2012 and january 2014 .
all patients had presented to us with spinal instability , unrelenting severe spinal pain and one patient with severe progressive radiculopathy . visual analog scale ( vas )
all patients underwent complete preoperative investigations , computed tomography ( ct ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scan , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) scan to know any other metastatic lesions in the body .
