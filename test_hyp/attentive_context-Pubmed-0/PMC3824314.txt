the vibration sensation of only one of the 50 participants in the h group , a 68-year - old male , measured less at the gt than at the mm , whereas 3 patients in the pnp group were found to have shorter vibration durations at the gt . as compared to the age - matched subjects from the group h , the duration of vibration sensation in the pnp group had a significantly shorter vibration duration at the gt but not at the mm measurement points ( p < 0.01 and p = 0.12 , resp . ) .
pearson 's r in measurements without socks were 0.502 ( p < 0.001 ) and 0.432 ( p = 0.001 ) , and with socks were 0.467 ( p = 0.002 ) and 0.416 ( p = 0.003 ) , respectively ( figure 2 ) .
the effect of wearing socks was found to be insignificant except that found on the mm in the h group , which was seen to have a small effect size upon further analysis with cohen 's d < 0.2  ( d = 0.17 ) .   vibration sensation was found to decline with age in the h group for two measurement points and both conditions .
