the aim of this study is to compare the high tie technique to the low tie technique with regard to anastomotic perfusion .
is favourable on the oncological or technical aspect , low tie ligation may be the technique of choice in patients undergoing rectum resection .
the mean number of lymph nodes harvested in the high tie group was 11 ( range , 623 ) ; in the low tie group , 12 ( range , 633 ) ( p  =  0.35 ) . the mean number of positive lymph nodes harvested in the high tie group was 3 ( 15 ) ; in the low tie group , 4 ( 19 ) ( p  =  0.32 ) .
this study focuses on the colorectal vasculature and the flow change after ht or lt .
when comparing high tie ligation to low tie ligation , this study shows the perfusion of the proximal loop of the anastomosis to be better after low tie ligation . considering neither of both techniques
only a slightly decreased blood flow was observed at the end of the operation ( bfr 0 , 91 ) , whereas an increased blood flow was measured after lt ( bfr 1 , 48 ) .
