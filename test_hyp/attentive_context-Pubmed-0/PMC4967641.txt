a healthy 35-year - old man was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia for acute cholecystitis .
this is a suspected case of hypersensitivity reaction associated with sugammadex reported for the first time in korea .
we need to be aware that the use of sugammadex is associated with a serious risk of anaphylaxis .
anaphylaxis is defined as " a serious , life - threatening , generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction " and " a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and might cause death " . the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is mainly based on the clinical course because the course rapidly deteriorates , as mentioned in the definition .
therefore , we suggest that vigilance after sugammadex administration is necessary . in summary , we present a case of a patient who presented with generalized erythema , dyspnea , and cardiovascular shock 2 min after sugammadex administration ; the case was confirmed to be anaphylaxis associated with sugammadex by a positive skin test .
thirteen cases of anaphylaxis associated with sugammadex have been reported until now in japan . however , to our knowledge , there is no reported case of anaphylaxis to date in our country .
