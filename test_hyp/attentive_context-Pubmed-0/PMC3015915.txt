we report the unique case of a patient with a centrally located left renal mass who underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy . during the hilar dissection
the patient was noted to have a left - sided inferior vena cava with multiple renal veins and anomalous tributaries .
left - sided inferior vena cava ( ivc ) is an unusual abnormality that may be clinically significant during renal surgery .
the embryology of a left - sided inferior vena cava is reviewed , and the safety and feasibility of a laparoscopic approach is discussed .
we report the case of a major inferior vena cava ( ivc ) anomaly encountered during laparoscopic nephrectomy and discuss its embryogenesis and management .
in accordance with other reports , our case demonstrates that laparoscopic radical nephrectomy can be successfully performed without complications in the presence of a left - sided ivc .
unexpected vascular anomalies may increase the risk of hemorrhage and necessitate conversion to open nephrectomy .
computed tomography revealed a 4-cm enhancing lesion located centrally within the left kidney ( figure 1 ) .
case reports have described this phenomenon during laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy without adverse effects . in our experience
preoperative knowledge of pertinent vascular anatomy is essential during laparoscopic renal surgery to avoid potential complications . to our knowledge , this is among the initial reported cases of a left - sided inferior vena cava encountered during laparoscopic radical nephrectomy .
