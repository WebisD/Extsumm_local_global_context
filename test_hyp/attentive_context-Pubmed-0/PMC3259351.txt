, swi has increasing indications for neuroradiology and should be included in the routine imaging protocols of trauma and vascular abnormalities .
latest advances have allowed the technique to be refined , thereby expanding its clinical applicability to brain imaging as a complementary source of information to conventional t1-weighted and t2-weighted imaging sequences .
further investigation is still needed into its extensive clinical application in neurodegenerative diseases and tumoural pathological conditions .
swi , which is a combination of ge techniques with phase information , represents a useful tool for the identification and characterisation of vascular malformations and for a better understanding of cerebrovascular diseases . despite some inherent limitations
for this reason , the phase - added information that is usually not available in the conventional magnitude image makes swi well suited for the visualisation of very small vessels such as the caput medusae of venous angiomas and telangiectasias as a result of a combination of slow flow with changes in deoxyhaemoglobin concentration .
sensitivity to susceptibility effects increases , progressing from fast spin - echo ( se ) to conventional se to gradient - echo ( ge ) sequences , from t2-weighting to t2 * -weighting , from short to long echo times and from lower to higher field strengths . before the clinical implementation of swi , susceptibility imaging relied only on ge sequences .
