we report an adult who presented with non - specific dizziness and lesions of the scc on magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) who was diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome ( hfrs ) with serologically proven hantaan virus infection .
hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome occurs mainly in europe and asia and is characterized by a fever and renal failure associated with hemorrhagic manifestations .
we report a reversible scc lesion associated with hfrs . to our knowledge , this is the first case of virus - associated encephalitis / encephalopathy in which the pathogen was a hantaan virus .
reversible focal lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum ( scc ) have been found in patients with various conditions including seizures , antiepileptic drug toxicity or withdrawal , viral encephalitis , hypoglycemia , wernicke 's encephalopathy , marchiafava - bignami disease , sympathomimetic - induced kaleidoscopic visual illusion syndrome , hemolytic uremic syndrome , altitude brain injury , and acute axonal injury .
analysis of the current literature revealed that the most frequent cause of reversible focal lesions of the scc is influenza virus - associated encephalitis / encephalopathy ( iaee ) .
transient restricted diffusion of the scc in patients with iaee has also been described ( 4 ) . here ,
