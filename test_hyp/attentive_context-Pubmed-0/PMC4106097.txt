the aim of this study was to investigate the association between the 794 ( catt)58 mif gene polymorphism and susceptibility to acs in a western mexican population .
the 6/7 genotype of the mif 794 ( catt)58 polymorphism is related with susceptibility to acs in a western mexican population .
also , in the acs group other clinical parameters such as troponin i ( tni ) , troponin t ( tnt ) , creatine phosphokinase ( cpk ) , and creatine kinase ( ck ) were evaluated in order to find a possible genetic association .
a significant association was found between the 6/7 genotype and susceptibility to acs ( 68% versus 47% in acs and hs , resp . ,
no deviation from the hardy - weinberg equilibrium was detected in the 794 ( catt)58 mif polymorphism ( p = 0.16 ) .
the most common genotypes in acs and hs subjects were 6/7 and 6/6 , respectively .
, we observed that the 6/7 genotype was the most frequent in each subgroup and that the 5/5 genotype was the less common .
, we found an association between the 6/7 genotype of the mif 794 ( catt)58 polymorphism and susceptibility to acs in a western mexican population .
