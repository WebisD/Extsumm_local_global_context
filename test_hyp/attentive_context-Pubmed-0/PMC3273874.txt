the combination of methods from the behavioral decision - making literature such as risky decision - making tasks derived from the classic work of kahneman and tversky ( 1979 ) , and methods of neuroscience such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) and lesion studies has led to breakthroughs in both fields .
the complementary roles of the vmpfc , amygdala , and insula depicted in the model are consistent with both the general hypothesis that separate processes underlie risk - taking for gains and losses , and the stricter hypothesis of separate neural structures coming together in different ways to guide risky decision - making in the gain and loss domains . in conclusion
logical questions are whether risk - taking for gains and risk - taking for losses can best be understood as separate psychological processes , and ultimately , whether they rely on different brain structures . in this paper , we integrate findings from our own work and that of others to come to conclusions that have some generality but also allow for differences between studies based on methodology . in order to frame this investigation , we start with a model put forth to support the findings from two studies we conducted with patients with lesions to areas of the brain known to be critical to risky decision - making , namely the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmpfc ) , the amygdala , and the insula ( bechara et al . , 1999 ;
