ideally , such tests would be noninvasive , lessening the risks to the embryo and reducing costs and workload in the embryology laboratory ( 19 ) .
the most apparent  and routinely applied - way of the assessment of viability is the morphological evaluation of in vitro fertilized embryos using microscopy .
the biggest issue with pre - implantation viability assessment is that due to ethical reasons any assay should be completely non - invasive because no one can predict what kind of interference would be the unwanted result in the later embryonic development .
infertility has been recognized as a public health issue worldwide ( 1 ) leading to an increasing need to the use of assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) , including in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) .
one of the areas of collaboration between clinicians , the clinical laboratory and the research laboratory at the university of pcs is related to the research of infertility . since the clinical background gives the beauty and the medical importance of laboratory research , it was of outstanding importance for us to receive the eflm - abbott diagnostics award for excellence in outcomes research in laboratory medicine ( paris , 2015 ) , the award given to the best published paper ( 47 ) , as judged by an independent panel of experts , which demonstrates improved outcomes arising out of the application or improved utilization of an in - vitro diagnostics test .
