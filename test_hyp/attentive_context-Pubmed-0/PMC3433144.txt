the present study sought to examine the relationship between current neighborhood - level socioeconomic position ( sep ) and cognitive level , including several specific cognitive domains in the active study , and response to cognitive training .
this paper adds to the body of research examining neighborhood - cognition associations in late life , and extends previous findings by looking beyond general cognition or cognitive status to examine effects of neighborhood across specific cognitive domains .
there was a lack of association between neighborhood sep and fluid cognitive abilities , as well as between neighborhood sep and immediate cognitive change following training .
the findings demonstrated that , after controlling for individual - level demographic predictors , census - defined neighborhood socioeconomic position independently predicted differences in late life vocabulary as measured in active , but not differences in general cognition (  g  ) , reasoning , everyday cognition , or speed .
the finding that neighborhood sep predicts crystallized cognitive abilities ( specifically , vocabulary ) suggests that neighborhood effects may be most related to sociocultural influences on cognitive development .
the present study sought to examine whether neighborhood socioeconomic position ( sep ) shows bivariate relationships with baseline cognitive level and immediate response to cognitive training , beyond individual - level predictors of cognition .
