diabetes patients , alpha - lipoic acid may influence angiogenesis through an effect on some circulating factors including vegf , bfgf , mcp-1 , and il-10 . therefore , the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of alpha - lipoic acid on endothelial dysfunction in youth with type 1 diabetes . this pilot study is a 6-month , double - blind , randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an antioxidant diet plus alpha - lipoic acid versus an antioxidant diet alone in improving endothelial dysfunction in adolescents with type 1 diabetes .
after 3 months , a significant reduction in daily insulin requirements was observed only in group 1 , both in the amount of the total daily dose ( 0.74  u / kg / day at 3 months versus 0.83  u / kg / day at baseline , p = 0.048 ) and in the percentage of bolus ( 22.0% at 3 months versus 26.3% at baseline , p = 0.047 ) ( table 1 ) .
moreover , the effects of alpha - lipoic acid on glycemic control need to be investigated as well , both as glycemic variability and hypo- and hyperglycemic events .
