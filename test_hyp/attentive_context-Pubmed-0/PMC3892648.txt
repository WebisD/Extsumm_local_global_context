, we investigated the prevalence of hvisa among mrsa strains isolated at hospital kuala lumpur ( hkl ) in a 3-month period and determined factors associated with its infections .
, we found that icu admission ( p<0.004 ) , hospitalization of more than 14 days ( p<0.014 ) and vancomycin administration of more than 7 days ( p<0.016 ) were independent factors associated with hvisa infections in our group of patients .
heterogenous vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus ( hvisa ) strains have been reported as indicators for reduced vancomycin susceptibility in s. aureus , and various studies associated its presence with vancomycin treatment failure .
as the strains used in this study were collected in a short span of 3 months , and that vancomycin treatment failure is on the rise in hkl , we suspect that the actual prevalence of hvisa in this hospital might be even higher .
we found the grd test useful for hvisa screening , nevertheless pap - auc analysis still remains the gold standard for hvisa confirmation .
medical history of each patient such as diabetes mellitus , renal failure , malignancy , together with prescription history of vancomycin and beta - lactam antibiotics ( as these were the only classes of antibiotics prescribed to the corresponding patients of the study isolates during this investigation ) , length of hospitalization and intensive care unit ( icu ) admission were recorded .
