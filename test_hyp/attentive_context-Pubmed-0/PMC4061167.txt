we aimed to evaluate the results of massive pe and thrombolytic treatment in patients with hemodynamic instability due to massive pe .
a total of 34 patients were diagnosed and treated with rt - pa because of massive pe .
we retrospectively evaluated patients with pe between january 2010 and december 2013 in the department of pulmonary medicine , medical park samsun hospital , samsun , turkey .
pulmonary embolism ( pe ) is a common disorder and an important cause of morbidity and mortality .
the complications of rt - pa treatment were hemorrhage in five ( 14.7% ) patients and allergic reactions in two ( 5.9% ) patients .
we suggested that the bradycardia and intractable tachycardia with systemic hypotension should be included in the criteria of thrombolytic treatment in patients with massive pe . in conclusion ,
twenty - two ( 64.7% ) patients went into cardiopulmonary arrest due to massive pe and 17 ( 50% ) of total patients recovered without sequelae .
if there is any sign of acute pe , echocardiography should be used during cardiopulmonary arrest / instability , and alteplase should be given to patients with suspected massive pe .
there are not enough data on recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ; alteplase ) in patients with massive pe .
