we also discuss the possible significance of the discovery of a new world ( nw ) sand fly - associated virus that shares a common ancestral lineage with nonvectored old world ( ow ) flaviviruses .
however , the phylogenetic position among the mosquito - borne viruses of epev conflicts with its lack of an ability to infect and replicate in vertebrate cell cultures or newborn mice .
abonnenci is not listed among the species of medical interest ( 110 ) , and ( iii ) the absence of viral replication in various vertebrate cells and in the brains of newborn mice suggests that epev could be an insect - only flavivirus rather than an arbovirus .
detailed comparative analysis of the entire viral rna sequence of epev revealed a genomic organization very similar to that of viruses in the genus flavivirus ( 2 , 3 ) .
epev is more distantly related to the other group of aedes - borne flaviviruses that include dengue viruses and the culex - associated group that includes wnv , slev , and zika virus .
when the origins of epev and the other flaviviruses are considered , most of the earliest phylogenetic lineages of the mosquito - borne viruses , tick - borne viruses , and nkvs are found in europe , asia , australia , and , in particular , africa . on the basis of the close relationships of the nw and ow mbfvs , the current opinion is that these viruses were introduced to the nw at various times before , during , or after the period of slave trading ( 33 ) .
