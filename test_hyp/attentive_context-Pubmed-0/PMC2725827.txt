this is the first study evaluating length of stay and mortality rates associated with mdr acinetobacter infection while controlling for important confounders such as severity of illness and underlying disease .
when controlling for severity of illness with the apache score and for underlying disease with the charlson index in a conditional logistic regression model , association with a longer hospital and icu length of stay was approximately twice as likely for patients with mdr acinetobacter infection as for susceptible references ( table 3 ) .
from january 2003 through august 2004 , a total of 166 patients had cultures that grew mdr acinetobacter , and 96 ( 58% ) met the nnis criteria for an mdr acinetobacter infection ( 16 ) .
multivariable analysis controlling for severity of illness with the apache score and underlying diseases with the charlson index showed a trend toward more deaths associated with infection with mdr acinetobacter than with infection with susceptible acinetobacter , but the difference was not statistically significant ( relative risk 2.6 , 95% ci 0.326.1 ) ( table 3 ) . * or , odds ratio ; ci , confidence interval . 
our study indicates that infections with mdr acinetobacter are independently associated with the adverse clinical outcomes of prolonged hospital and icu lengths of stay compared with the outcomes for uninfected patients and those infected with drug - susceptible acinetobacter .
