therefore , the objective of the present paper is to report a case of male paediatric patient with bilateral ectopia of the mandibular permanent lateral incisors and discuss both implications regarding such an anomaly and treatment outcomes .
due to the importance of the early diagnosis in those cases of eruptive alteration , dentists should take into account the followup of both tooth eruption and formation of permanent dentition so that any change in the normal dental development can be diagnosed and readily treated .
in fact , it is a rare developmental anomaly whose aetiology is unknown and controversial .
caucasian male patient of 11 years old was brought by his mother to the paediatric dentistry clinic complaining that the child 's two mandibular teeth  appeared to be tilted  . during the interview the mother reported no relevant previous medical history and no cases of ectopia in the family as well . on facial examination ,
dental ectopia is characterised by the change in the normal pathway of a tooth eruption , which may occur in any region of the alveolar and basal bone .
if not treated early , this dental anomaly may develop into partial or complete transposition of the permanent canines   .
