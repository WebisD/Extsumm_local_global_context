a one - on - one fellowship program enables rapid , safe , and effective laparoscopic skills acquisition by established urologists .
fellowship , enabling supervised training so that interested urologists could become comfortable and competent with laparoscopic urology .
it is an unfortunate fact that many interested urologists do not progress beyond the initial courses stage and indeed a number of urologists who have attended animal laboratory training as well have not proceeded to regular urological laparoscopic practice .
this is primarily due to a lack of approved urology / laparoscopy fellowships , as exist in the united states .
prior practice on simulators using laparoscopic instruments is encouraged to enable the trainees to get the most out of their time spent with the mentor in the clinical setting .
the fellowship program is available to those who have completed the 2 initial training steps , ie , basic / advanced training courses and an animal laboratory course .
although great enthusiasm exists for developing skills in laparoscopic urology in the united kingdom , training opportunities are limited .
six of them are in independent laparoscopic urological practice , and the others are in phase 6 or above .
