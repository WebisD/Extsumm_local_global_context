a 20-year - old female was referred to our hospital with complaints of icterus and breathlessness .
transfusion requirement should be considered as a medical emergency even if serologic testing is incomplete .
patients with multiple alloantibodies should receive phenotypically matched red blood cells to avoid transfusion reaction and they should be given a card indicating the antibody specificities so that he can receive antigen negative blood . in either case , a good communication must be established between the clinician and the transfusion specialist to assess the clinical urgency and the complexity of serological studies . the final decision to transfuse
immune hemolysis is a shortening of red blood cell survival due , directly or indirectly to antibodies .
due to pan agglutinin in the serum of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia , crossmatching blood is a difficult and time - consuming process since the pan agglutinin reacts with all donors red blood cells .. moreover , the most pressing problem is detection and identification of rbc alloantibodies that may be masked by the autoantibodies . in our patient ,
