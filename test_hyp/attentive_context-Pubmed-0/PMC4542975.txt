the goal of this protocol is to achieve the same endpoints as in a conventional procedure , i.e. , isolation of all pulmonary veins with proven bi - directional block , and to reduce fluoroscopy exposure for the patient by > 90% as compared to conventional settings via the additional use of the nfcv technology .
this changed by application of nfcv technology since catheters will be visible during the entire procedure on this virtual biplanar view . in this protocol , we perform an ablation of atrial fibrillation in a patient with paroxysmal , drug - refractory and highly symptomatic atrial fibrillation .
it has been previously shown that the application of the mg technology can lead to a significant reduction in fluoroscopy burden by using diagnostic catheters in atrial flutter and by using both diagnostic and ablation catheters in several supraventricular tachycardias ( svt ) and atrial fibrillation ( af ) cases .
there may be concerns that the application of the non - fluoroscopic catheter visualization ( nfcv ) technology may increase procedural risks in the absence of the catheter shaft visualization and catheter localization that is solely based on the location of the catheter tip .
