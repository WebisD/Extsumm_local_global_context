the aim of this study was to determine the relation between dose - volume parameters ( in the prostate and oars ) obtained from hdr - bt treatment plans and particular prostate cancer prognostic factors along with prostate volume and the number of implanted needles . in the study ,
no relationship was found between any prognostic factor and rectal wall dvh parameters . in other words , increased prostate volume with improved d90 and larger number of implanted needles results in better target coverage ( higher value of v100 ) , better dose distribution ( less hot - spots with lower value of v200 ) and decreased dose delivered to the urethra ( lower urethral d10 and dmax ) .
in conclusion , statistical analysis revealed significant correlation between age , t stage , prostate volume and number of needles used for the implant and increased prostatic d90 and v100 , decreased v200 . amongst prognostic factors
modern high - dose - rate brachytherapy ( hdr - bt ) of prostate cancer enables the delivery of a very high single or multiple dose of radiation to the target volume ( e.g. prostate capsule ) and , at the same time , preventing the organs at risk from unnecessary radiation ( e.g. urethra and rectal wall )   .
