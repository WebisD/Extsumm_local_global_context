consider to cockroaches role in transmission and distribution of many human pathogens , their resistance to many chemical insecticides , the side - effects of insecticide usage in human dwellings , high distribution of the brown - banded cockroach in ahvaz city during recent years , and eventually in order to finding a safe alternative for chemical insecticides , the present study was done to evaluate toxicity and repellency of following five essential oils , eucalyptus oil ( eucalyptus sp ) , mint oil ( mentha piprita ) , yarrow oil ( achillea millefolium ) , oregano oil ( origanum vulgare ) and rosemary oil ( rosmarinus officinalis ) against this cockroach species .
given that s. longipalpa can be found in all parts of the buildings such as clothes lockers , beds , furniture and cabinets and that ootheca stick in hard - to - reach or obscure places , application of chemical insecticide spraying in such places is hard and unacceptable by the people .
however , the use of essential oils presents a safe alternative for indoor application against cockroaches because of less toxicity to humans and no toxic residues .
the tested essential oils showed contact toxicity , fumigant toxicity and repellent activity against the brown - banded cockroach compared to control group during this study .
