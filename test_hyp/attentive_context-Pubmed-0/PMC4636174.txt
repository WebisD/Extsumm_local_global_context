although herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) infections are very common worldwide , herpes simplex encephalitis ( hse ) is a rare disease with an incidence of one case per 250,000500,000 individuals per year .
we present a patient with coinfection of cmv and hsv type ii ( hsv - ii ) , who was admitted to the hospital for acute psychotic symptoms , but never treated with immunosuppressants before this admission .
the co - existence of high crp level and the antibodies to cmv and hsv - ii reminded us of a recent human study , in which the crp level was strongly associated with viral detection rate and mixed viral / bacterial detection rate ; whereas the rate of bacterial detection was not associated with the crp level.21 more significantly , plasma crp was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by virus infections.21,22 in summary , we present a case of a 67-year - old male with coinfection of cmv and hsv - ii and without history of being treated with immunosuppressants .
approximately 50% of patients with hse are older than 50 years.1 cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , another member of the herpesvirus family , is the most common cause of congenital infection , with a prevalence rate of 0.2%2.5% in all live newborns.2,3 in adults , most reported cmv infections are seen in immunocompromised patients such as those with hiv ( human immunodeficiency virus)4,5 and after chemoradiotherapy.6 in these cases , the patients were also co - infected with hsv . here ,
