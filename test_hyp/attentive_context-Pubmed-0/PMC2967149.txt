however , the studies that comply with the inclusion criteria of the meta - analysis , i.e. non - calcified mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions , reported an npv of 100% and concluded that mri can be a useful tool in mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions , especially when mammographic findings are asymmetry or architectural distortion .
therefore , in this meta - analysis , the usefulness of breast mri as a problem - solving modality in patients with mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions is investigated .
studies were included if the following inclusion criteria were met : ( 1 ) all patients underwent a mammography and breast mri ; ( 2 ) the study population had mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions or mammographic bi - rads 3 microcalcifications ; ( 3 ) accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) and/or npv was / were measured ; ( 4 ) studies with original data that were published in peer - reviewed journals .
although there are sparse data , the first solid data indicate that breast mri might be useful as a problem - solving modality to exclude patients with non - calcified mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions from further diagnostic work - up .
