we report a case of f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) positron emission tomography ( pet ) super scan which shows features akin to super scan of skeletal scintigraphy and resolution of these features following initial phase of chemotherapy .
 super scan  is a well described phenomenon on skeletal scintigraphy which is characterized by high skeletal to soft tissue ratio , uniform symmetrically increased bone uptake , and absent renal visualization .
a twelve - year old male presented with multiple joint pains , periorbital and sternal swellings of one - month duration .
it is an extremely rare malignant tumor with fewer than 50 cases in english literature .
another unusual feature of this case is the excellent chemotherapeutic response shown in this patient ; pnet of kidney is known to respond poorly to chemotherapy and a functional imaging modality may serve as a useful tool to demonstrate early response in such rare cases . 
reversal of these abnormalities on functional imaging following therapy guides the clinician to choose the best available regimen for this otherwise chemotherapy nave disease .
similar characteristics of diffuse and intense hypermetabolism throughout the skeleton have been described in the earlier publications.  however , the scan in this case shows a very high contrast between the metastatic and non - metastatic organs with extremely low f-18 fdg uptake in brain , muscles of limbs , mediastinum , and bowel .
