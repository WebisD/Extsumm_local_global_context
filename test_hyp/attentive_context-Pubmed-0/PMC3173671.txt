it is found in up to 40% of patients at surgery or autopsy.1 ) the aortic valve and its adjacent ring are more susceptible to abscess formation and paravalvular extension compared to the mitral valve.1 ) we report a case of staphylococcal endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve complicated by a para - aortic abscess that ruptured into the aortic sinus diagnosed by trans - thoracic echocardiogram .
, we report a case of staphylococcal infective endocarditis involving tricuspid valve complicated by para - aortic abscess in a 15-year - old man with bicuspid aortic valve .
the patient received 4 weeks of antibiotics therapy and had a good quality of life at 5-month follow - up without surgical treatment .
staphylococcal tricuspid valve endocarditis with para - aortic abscess in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve is rare .
transesophageal echocardiography was performed on the fourth hospital day to further investigate the oval echolucent area near the aortic valve , which confirmed a bicuspid aortic valve along with a para - aortic abscess that communicated directly with the aortic sinus ( fig .
repeat transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated bicuspid aortic valve along with a persistent para - aortic abscess communicating with the aortic sinus .
