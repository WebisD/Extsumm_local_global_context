briefly , broken - milled rice ( oryza sativa ) was used as the feeding substrate and distilled water was used as a medium for growth of acetobacter xylinum . under appropriate incubation , the bacterium could synthesize cellulose .
single application of the cellulose mask significantly enhanced moisture uptake by the skin when compared with moist towel application ( p < 0.05 ) . however , it did not change skin characteristics to a significant degree .
, it was reported that eight of thirty - four volunteers had a significantly greater reduction in eye puffiness after application of caffeine gel than after placebo ( p < 0.05 ) , while most volunteers did not show a differential response to these two products.15 the results from our questionnaires demonstrated that the odor , color , and texture of the cellulose masks were acceptable to the subjects , the majority of whom rated the cellulose mask comfortable to use and able to provide skin hydration within an acceptable period .
skin transparency improved in eight of the 30 volunteers ( 26.7% ) when using the cellulose mask .
these results indicate that a single application of the cellulose mask did not significantly reduce sebum levels or increase elasticity of the skin ( p > 0.05 ) . however , it did significantly enhance moisture uptake ( p < 0.05 ) .
