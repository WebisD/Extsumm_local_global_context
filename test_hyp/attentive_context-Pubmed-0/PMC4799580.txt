many randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) about the role of isoflavones in men with pca have been developed ; however , these results are inconsistent . in this study , we review some critical issues involving the effects of isoflavones on psa , sex steroid hormone levels and risk of pca , and the difference in concentrations of isoflavones in vitro and human body . whether isoflavones can lead to pca progression
prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second most common neoplasia in men worldwide , and the sixth cause of cancer - specific death worldwide . in the last 20 years
the effect of isoflavones on sex hormone levels and pca risk may be determined by some factors involving having or not having equol converting bacteria in the intestine , specific polymorphic variation in the region of the associated gene , the concentrations of isoflavones .
the concentrations of isoflavones in vitro studies have never been achieved in the serum of human body of common diet .
it is noteworthy that isoflavones may act as an agonist in pca and lead to several anomalies of the reproductive systems for infant exposure .
most of the clinical trials suggest isoflavones do not play an important role on psa levels reduction in pca patients or healthy men .
