the study was aimed to explore the association between spo2 and spirometer parameters of disease severity in copd patients with a view to identify whether the pulse oximetry can be used as an alternative to arterial values in the clinical management of copd patients in routine practice .
the median fev1 % predicted in the stage 0 was [ median 90% , interquartile range ( 90%-95% ) ] ; stage i was 83% , 75%-89% ; stage ii was 62% , 51%-79% ; stage iii was 45% , 38%-48% and also stage iv was 27% , 21%-33% , which was a significant differences among them in five stages of gold using kruskal - wallis test ( p value < 0.05 ) .
physiological variables of the included patients there was not a significant association between fev1 % predicted and spo2 % ( p value > 0.05 ) , while there was a significant association between fev1/fvc % predicted and spo2 % ( r = 0.556 , p value < 0.001 ) [ figures 1 and 2 ] .
the median fev1/fvc % predicted in the stage 0 was [ median 74% , interquartile range ( 73%-89% ] ; stage i was 72.5% , 69%-78% ; stage ii was 70% , 58%-79% ; stage iii was 56% , 52%-70 % and also stage iv was 57.5% , 47%-68% , which was a significant differences among them in five stages of gold ( p value < 0.05 ) .
