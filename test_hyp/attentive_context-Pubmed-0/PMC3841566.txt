we present two cases of type 2 dm with ds and believe that this is the first report of type dm with ds .
down 's syndrome ( ds ) is one of the common chromosomal disorders and the most common cause of mental retardation .
although cases of ds associated with diabetes mellitus ( dm ) have been reported in the past , invariably all cases were associated with type 1 dm .
it is well - known that patients with ds have an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders affecting both endocrine and non - endocrine organs .
a 28-year - old male patient with a body mass index ( bmi ) of 25.1 kg / m and positive family history of dm reported to the out - patient clinic of the department of endocrinology , medwin hospital with the clinical features of polyuria and polydipsia for last 1 year .
further investigations are warranted to prove whether the presence of type diabetes in patients with ds was a chance association or whether there is a genetic basis for this association . however , these two cases point to the fact that one should screen patients with ds for type 2 diabetes .
