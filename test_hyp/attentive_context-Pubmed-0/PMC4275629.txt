based on the above study it can be concluded that the noise levels detected in this study were considered to be close to the limit of risk of hearing loss ( 85 db(a ) ) ; a necessary reduction of exposure in sound levels is required for acoustic comfort .
the aims of this study were to measure noise levels produced during the different dental learning clinics , by equipment 's used in dental learning areas under different working conditions and by used and brand new handpieces under different working conditions .
in pre - clinical and clinical areas , the microphone was placed at ear level at a distance of 15 cm from a main noise source to simulate the auditory position of the operator .
the noise level of a contra angle handpiece at the clinical areas was lower than at the pre - clinical areas , which may have been because students rarely used the maximum speed of the air contra angle handpiece during dental treatment , while in the pre - clinical area it was always used at the higher speeds .
teachers and students are vulnerable to different noise levels while working and teaching in dental clinics and laboratories .
