we present a case of bilateral femoral shaft insufficiency fractures secondary to long - term alendronate therapy .
a 74-year - old lady presented to orthopaedic clinic with a four - month history of bilateral thigh pain .
osteoporosis - related fractures are a major public health problem mainly in postmenopausal women and the elderly .
four days after consultation , she tripped and sustained a transverse fracture of the left femur and underwent uneventful femoral intramedullary nailing ( figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) ) .
recently , however , there is an emerging concern regarding long bone stress fractures secondary to long - term alendronate intake .
patients on more than 5 years of alendronate therapy should be reevaluated annually regarding continuation of treatment and need close observation .
however , this is a case report with characteristic features and bilateral involvement which highlights the importance of evaluating patients on long - term alendronate therapy and recommends early prophylactic internal fixation of these fractures .
alendronate ( fosamax , merck & company , inc . ) is one of the first bisphosphonates to be licensed and used .
there was still persistent pain in the right femur and a definite linear lucency in the lateral femoral cortex on plain radiographs .
