a 19-year - old young man , presented with a painless gradually increasing swelling at the anterior aspect of left knee of 9 months duration .
after diagnostic arthroscopy , we performed an open excision of the cystic mass and confirmed the retinacular rent pre - operatively .
mri scan revealed a multilobulated , cyst with septations within the anterior aspect of the knee joint , just inferolateral to the patella , with deep extension into the infrapatellar fat pad , and superficial extension into the subcutaneous space across the retinaculum .
we report a case of intraarticular ganglion cyst of knee arising from the infrapatellar fat pad and protruding anterolaterally through retinacular rent into the subcutaneous plane .
they are usually encountered as incidental findings in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , or in arthroscopy .
arthroscopic resection and debridement is the gold standard treatment in ganglion cyst of the knee .
those arising from the hoffa s fat pad , usually present as palpable mass at anterior aspect of the knee joint .
they may originate from both the cruciate ligaments and the menisci , from the popliteus tendon and alar folds , infrapatellar fat pad of hoffa , and subchondral bone cysts .
