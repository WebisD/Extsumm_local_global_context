our investigations suggest that changes in the gut microbiota in response to the cold exposure mediate ba metabolism , possibly through changes in ampk and fxr signaling , to complement sympathetic signaling in the regulation of thermogenesis in ibat and resistance to dio .
cold exposure at 12c causes a strong and rapid induction of the brown adipose phenotype in ibat , but not in ing , an increased whole - animal energy expenditure , and a complete suppression of dio .
a primary and essential task of all endothermic animals is to maintain a normal body temperature by inducing thermogenesis in response to cold . here , we demonstrate that reducing ambient temperature from 29c to 12c or even 17c also protects the host from dio , an effect that is associated with increased ucp1 expression in ibat .
we demonstrated that transplantation of caecal material from mice reared at 12c to gf recipients improved their metabolic phenotype .
recently , it was shown that the depletion of the microbiota by antibiotic treatment or gf conditions stimulates the induction of brite cells by enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling from eosinophil infiltration ( surez - zamorano et  al . , 2015 ) . here , we show that both the acute and chronic exposure to reduced ambient temperature leads to induction of ucp1 in ibat and rapid changes in the composition of the gut microbiota and ba metabolism .
