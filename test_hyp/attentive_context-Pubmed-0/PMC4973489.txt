the factors which significantly correlated with noncompliance to treatment completion were radiation - induced acute mucositis ( p = 0.02 ) , loss of appetite and worsened nutritional intake ( p = 0.000 ) , and lost to follow - up ( leading to noncompletion of planned radiotherapy ) ( p = 0.02 ) .
all the patients registered in the department of radiotherapy and oncology of our institute between january 2008 and december 2012 with a diagnosis of locally advanced nonmetastatic middle thoracic esophageal cancer were included in this audit . of the 1248 patients of esophageal cancer registered in the department , 91 patients ( 7.3% ) of nonmetastatic middle thoracic esophageal cancer who planned for radical treatment
on multivariate analysis , loss of appetite postoperatively leading to nutritional inadequacy and excessive weight loss was the only factor which was significantly correlated to treatment interruption in the form of inability to take adjuvant treatment ( p = 0.02 ) . among the 36 patients in group 2 , 17 patients could not complete planned treatment . the only factors which significantly correlated with noncompliance to treatment completion in this group were loss of appetite and worsened nutritional intake ( p = 0.05 ) and chemotherapy - induced myelosuppression ( p = 0.05 ) . among the forty patients in group 3 , 11 patients could not complete planned treatment .
