the mean tpoab concentration decreased significantly by 49.5% ( p < 0.013 ) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% ( p < 0.95 ) in the placebo - treated group . in subgroup analysis , the decrease in the mean tpoab titre was highest in the subclinical hyperthyroid group ( up to 64.42% ) , and comparable in the other three groups ( 41.13% , 47.18% , and 42.64% in the euthyroid , hypothyroid , and subclinical hypothyroid groups respectively ) .
one patient with hypothyroidism in the selenium treated group with a tpoab concentration of > 1000 iu / ml , had completely normalized antibody concentrations after 3 months .
patients were randomized into two age and tpoab - matched groups ; 30 patients received 200 g sodium selenite / day , orally , for 3 months , and 30 patients received placebo .
it was also found that those patients with tpoab greater than 1000 iu / ml revealed a mean 31.38% reduction in the selenium - treated patients , compared with no significant change in tpoab in the placebo group .
patients of all age groups and both sexes with autoimmune thyroid disease ( as defined by an anti- thyroid peroxidase antibody [ tpoab ] level more than 150 iu / ml ) irrespective of the baseline thyroid status . patients with overt hyperthyroidism who are on antithyroid drugs ,
