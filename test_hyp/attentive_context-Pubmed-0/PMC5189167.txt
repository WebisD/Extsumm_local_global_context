these rates of seropositivity are relatively low compared with the rate found in a study in uruguay , in which 18.4% ( 83/479 ) of the blood samples were seropositive by layer microagglutination ( 7 ) . in that study , the innate susceptibility of pigs to c. burnetii was confirmed during a q fever epidemic .
we did not test such tissues ; however , the positivity rate in our study was similar to that ( 0/16 ) in a previous examination of pig placentas by real - time pcr in the netherlands ( 10 ) . in our study ,
we found that 6.8% , 5.2% , and 0.3% of tested pig samples in gyeongsang province were positive for c. burnetii by elisa , ifa , and pcr , respectively .
similar to results from a previous study ( 11 ) , our results showed that ifa was less sensitive than elisa at detecting c. burnetii in serum .
although the number of c. burnetii  positive pigs was low in our study , a previous study identified contact with pigs as a risk factor for c. burnetii seropositivity in humans ( 15 ) .
additional investigations of the infection prevalence in other animals are necessary to understand the epidemiology of c. burnetii .
