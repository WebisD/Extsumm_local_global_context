a 7-year - old boy was admitted for excision of a cystic swelling at the posterior aspect of the base of the tongue a few centimeters anterior to the valleculae .
it is seen with the use of lasers that do not make use of optical fibers for laser beam delivery , such as carbon - dioxide ( co2 ) lasers which use articulated arm technology .
they have optical fibers for delivery of the laser at the site of surgery , facilitating more precision and control .
laser resistant tubes are available for use during laser surgery . to reduce the obstruction in the surgical field , by airway instruments ,
the saline - soaked throat pack was obstructing the field of vision of the surgeon and also restricting the outward pull of the tongue as cyst was large ( 3  3 cm ) and placed posteriorly .
as the surgery had been completed and we were able to ventilate the lungs , we reversed the neuromuscular blockade .
the removed ett [ figure 1 ] had a very small circular hole and the inner aspect of the tube was black distal to the hole [ figure 2 ] .
