we report a case of cmv - ptc in a patient with apc , comparing with its documented cytomorphology and discuss its useful cytomorphological features in discriminating from other thyroid neoplasms .
cribriform - morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( cmv - ptc ) is a distinct ptc with a better prognosis .
a 24-year - old female presented with altered bowel habits and bleeding per rectum was diagnosed with apc .
the affected patients have shown both germline and somatic mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) genes . unlike classic ptc ,
diagnosed apc patients , especially those with concurrent thyroid enlargement require exclusion of cmv - ptc , which has a recognizable cytomorphology and a favorable outcome .
lack of colloid has been a constant feature both in the case series and this case .
a series of 18 cases describe varying cellular arrangements with papillary pattern , which had been the predominant pattern in three - fourths of described cases .
immunocytochemical staining with beta - catenin and biotin as well have shown a value in cytological diagnosis .
at the same visit , she was diagnosed to have a multinodular goiter on imaging .
