36 wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups : sham - operated group ( sham group , n = 12 ) , ischemia - reperfusion group ( i / r group , n = 12 ) ,    pcr preconditioning group ( pcr group , n = 12 ) .
a few tunel - positive cells were observed in the cortex of rats in sham group whereas a large number of tunel - positive cells was observed in the cortex of rats subject to i / r injury ; compared with i / r group , the number of tunel positive cells was significantly reduced in the cortex of pcr group ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
the cam activity of i / r group and pcr group was significantly increased at 48 hours after reperfusion compared with sham group whereas cam activity was significantly decreased in the cortex of pcr group compared with i / r group ( figure 4 ) .  
mda in i / r group and pcr group was significantly increased at 48 hours after reperfusion compared with sham group , but compared with i / r group , mda content was significantly decreased in the cortex of pcr group ( figure 5 ) .
