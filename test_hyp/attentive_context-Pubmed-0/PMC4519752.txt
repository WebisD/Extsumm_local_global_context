comparison of evolution of the mg strain with that of strains that carry a full complement of glycolytic genes provides an interesting starting point for studies on the impact of gene duplication on evolutionary flexibility of a ubiquitous central metabolic pathway .
a second , semiquantitative characterization explored the phenotype of the  minimal glycolysis  ( mg )
one of the hypotheses that has been proposed to explain retention of functionally redundant paralogs during evolution is a contribution to gene dosage and , thereby , to the capacity of the pathway or process in which they operate ( 97 , 98 ) .
the absence of a clear phenotype under standard laboratory conditions makes the mg strain an even more interesting platform for future high - throughput studies to investigate its phenotype under more conditions .
the availability of a well - defined yeast platform with a minimal complement of glycolytic enzymes should provide clear advantages for quantitative modeling of the kinetics and regulation of glycolysis , as it eliminates the intrinsic uncertainties caused by the simultaneous , context - dependent expression of different isoenzymes . in view of the important role of glucose transport in the kinetics of yeast glycolysis , we are currently constructing mg variants with a single hexose transporter .
