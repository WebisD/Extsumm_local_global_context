only patients who have growth located at the bladder neck on the cut - open specimen should have fsa .
relationship between location of the tumor and the involvement of the prostate gland ( n=128 ) the 1- and 5-year overall survival of patients with negative fsa were 91.5% ( 95% ci , 8593.5 ) and 79% ( 95% ci , 7284% ) , and of those in whom fsa was not performed were 93% ( 95% ci , 8695% ) and 82% ( 95% ci , 7489% ) .
we analyzed our data to assess the need for fsa in patients of radical cystectomy planned for onb .
none of the patients without fsa ( 42 ) had urethral recurrence at a mean follow - up of 36  9.3 months .
, fsa seems to be an unnecessary step and mere visual impression of the tumor and urethra could be helpful in deciding about sending the urethral margin for fsa .
[ figure 3 ] the mean follow - up times were 46.3  25.1 months and 36  9.3 months for the frozen section negative and not sent groups , respectively .
of these 28 patients , three ( 10.7% ) had a positive urethral margin and all these three patients had tumor involving the bladder neck .
