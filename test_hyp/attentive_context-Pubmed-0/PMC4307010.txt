we herein report a man with anti - glur antibody but without anti - nmdar antibody , presenting with predominantly frontal lobar encephalitis , and discuss the clinical significance of this type of non - paraneoplastic anti - glur encephalitis .
this discrepancy suggests that neuronal damage was too mild to produce cytotoxic edema , and only a small area of the left supramarginal gyrus remained permanently injured
the clinical manifestation of nonparaneoplastic anti - nmdar encephalitis ( without ovarian teratoma ) is similar to that of paraneoplastic anti - nmdar encephalitis ( with ovarian teratoma ) . in many cases ,
little is known about the clinical difference between anti - nmdar antibody - only encephalitis and anti - glur antibody - only encephalitis .
the medial temporal lobes and cerebral cortex are affected on mri . on the other hand , patients with anti - glutamate receptor ( glur ) 2 ( nr2b ) antibody have been reported to show an association with nonherpetic acute limbic encephalitis ( nhale ) , rasmussen 's encephalitis , and chronic forms of epilepsia partialis continua   .
. this reversible cortical damage may be another characteristic of anti - glur antibody - only encephalitis .
