genome - based strategies , including genome sequencing , microarray - based expression technology , and large - scale mutagenesis studies , are expected to contribute , in the near future , for the development of new strategies and/or antimicrobials molecules to fight the devastating and presently difficult - to - treat infections caused by bcc strains .
the pathogenic mechanisms and traits used by these bacteria , the clinical outcomes of infected patients , and the interaction of the introduced biocontrol strains with environmental and clinical strains need further studies . presently , there is some evidence that the environment can be a reservoir for the acquisition of novel bcc infections .
the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms employed by bcc bacteria for virulence and pathogenesis is of crucial importance to identify new targets for the rational design of novel strategies and/or molecules to combat bcc infections , since their resistance to most of the clinically - relevant antimicrobials renders the infections untreatable . in order to be regarded as a potential drug target ,
members of the bcc have emerged in the last decades as important pathogens to human , animals , and plants .
members of the burkholderia cepacia complex ( bcc ) are gram - negative bacteria of the -proteobacteria subdivision and include plant , animal , and human pathogens , with a widespread distribution in natural and man - made inhabitats .
