our finding of a depdc5 variant in up to 2.3% of patients in our cohort suggests that this gene may be one of the more frequent genes associated with epileptic spasms , taking into account that this cohort had been previously screened for many of the known genes .
our findings suggest that greater significance should be attributed to a family history of focal seizures in patients with epileptic spasms .
we identified likely pathogenic variants in 3 of 130 ( 2.3% ) patients with epileptic spasms of unknown etiology ( table 1 , figures 1 and 2 ) .
we have combined a targeted resequencing approach in 130 patients and results from clinical diagnostics and extended phenotyping in a known mutation - positive family to determine several notable features that highlight the variability of onset and outcome of depdc5-associated spasms .
as only 1 patient showed classic hypsarrhythmia , the cohort may have some fundamental differences from other studies of infantile spasms in which hypsarrhythmia is essential for inclusion .
third , 1 patient had later onset of spasms in the third year with further cognitive decline in adolescence .
a total of 92 of 130 patients had west syndrome , while 38 had epileptic spasms in association with other epileptic encephalopathies . in 2 cases ( families a and c ) , the depdc5 variants occurred de novo .
