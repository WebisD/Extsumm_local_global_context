, our study indicates that ipf patients with dm are more likely to have a typical interstitial pneumonia ( uip ) pattern on hrct , including reticular and honeycomb patterns , than are ipf patients without dm . the prevalence of hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and other malignancies , excluding lung cancer , is significantly higher in ipf patients with dm than in ipf patients without dm .
cardiovascular disease was present in 2.3% of group a patients and 10.7% of group b patients , a difference that was also statistically significant ( p = 0.000 ) .
since the korean population almost entirely comprises a single ethnicity , it is uniquely suitable for investigation of the clinical characteristics of a disease . the korean interstitial lung disease ( ild ) research group retrospectively conducted a national multi - center survey to evaluate the prevalence of ipf and the characteristics of patients with the disease .
hypertension was present in 18.5% of group a patients and 37.5% of group b patients , and the difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.000 ) .
the korean ild study group affiliated with the korean academy of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases analyzed the medical records of patients who had been newly diagnosed with ipf by pulmonology specialists at 54 large university and training hospitals between january 1 , 2003 , and december 31 , 2007 .
