we report a 2.5-year - old girl with congenital absence of the right pulmonary artery with associated congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation ( ccam ) of the right lower lobe , patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) , and atrial septal defect ( asd ) , who presented with ortner 's syndrome due to severe pulmonary hypertension .
unilateral absence of pulmonary artery ( uapa ) is a rare congenital abnormality , with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 200,000 .
unilateral absence of pulmonary artery should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children who present with cyanosis , pulmonary hypertension , or recurrent lower respiratory tract infections .
this syndrome was first described by ortner in 1897 in two patients who had mitral stenosis and left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis .
a 2.5-year - old girl presented with hoarseness of voice noticed since 3 months of age , breathlessness for the past 15 days and failure to thrive .
fetterolf and norris studied the anatomic relations of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve in cadavers and concluded that the nerve must be squeezed between the enlarged left pulmonary artery and the aorta or ligamentum arteriosum .
pulmonary agenesis is usually unilateral , right sided absence of pulmonary artery being more common .
