we intend to clinically evaluate the digestibility of raw milk vs pasteurized milk , but to guide the design of our study ,
considering the number of respondents who cited discomfort drinking milk , it was surprising that only 5 ( 3% ) respondents were diagnosed as lactose intolerant and only 1 ( 0.7% ) was confirmed lactose intolerant by means of an hbt . in terms of symptoms between before and after beginning to drink raw milk , responses included , 
although these results are consistent with expectations of the cows and husbandry that are associated with raw milk for human consumption , it is unknown how reliable the reporting of this information is .
we queried on the digestibility of drinking milk under three conditions : ( 1 ) the reaction to drinking pasteurized milk before switching to raw milk ; ( 2 ) the reaction experienced currently when drinking raw milk ; and ( 3 ) the reaction of drinking pasteurized milk after having switched to raw milk .
these findings suggest that the symptoms of lactose intolerance were mild enough to not warrant the respondents ' seeking a medical diagnosis or that the respondents self - diagnosed and sought alternatives to pasteurized milk .
