there is high media interest in publishing health - related reportage , and this opportunity to motivate healthy lifestyles should be explored more intensively .
the study presents a new approach to increase participation in a high - cost lifestyle intervention program . from an international perspective
, all participants experienced a significant increase in their vo2max , a reduction in their bmi , and an improvement in the running test ( table 1 ) .
if this paper launched a similar project and received the same level of interest as the current study , almost three million readers might follow this lifestyle intervention program .
the newspaper wanted to collaborate with the university of stavanger to design an exercise program and train three sedentary adults .
the main purpose of this study was to measure the response from readers regarding reports of untrained adults who participated in an individually designed lifestyle intervention program .
a challenge is to ensure that major editorial desks are made aware of this opportunity to acquire new readers or viewers , and hopefully the present study can facilitate this type of collaboration .
thus , there is great potential for recruiting participants to physical activity interventions by working with a newspaper or other large - scale media organizations .
