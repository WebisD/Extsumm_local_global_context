interestingly , the compliance was significantly higher among the two groups at either end of the curve , that is , younger than 50 years ( 77% ) and older than 81 years ( 63% ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
educating patients about their disease and its complications , using guiding brochures and dvds , and improving the patient - physician relation by personalizing the treatment can plausibly improve compliance rates .
mean age and sd among compliance patients group and noncompliance patients group were similar ( table 1 ) .  
poag patients attending out - patient eye clinics at the 3 cities , tira , taibi , and qalanswa in israel , were invited to join the study .
logistic regression analysis revealed that age can not predict compliance ( p > 0.05 ) .
we found a positive statistical significance in the correlation between age and number of prescribed drugs ( p < 0.05 ) .
the overall noncompliance rate was 50% and was not influenced by gender or by number of anti - iop drugs .
the aim of this study is to estimate the degree , components , and determinants of noncompliance among poag arab patients in israel and to verify associated factors for noncompliance .
