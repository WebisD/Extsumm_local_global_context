these studies indicate that sp signaling contributes to granuloma development and proinflammatory cytokine production in t. crassiceps   infection and suggests a potential role for this mediator in human cysticercosis .
sp injection induced recruitment of leukocytes into the pleural cavity of mice and into the skin of humans       and stimulated the migration of human fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes in studies using modified boyden chambers or micropore filter analysis , respectively   . in the current studies , we determined granuloma size and measured levels of il-1 , tnf- , and il-6 protein within granuloma obtained from t. crassiceps - infected wt and mice deficient in spp or nk1 .
the current studies demonstrating that sp signaling contributes to granuloma formation in taenia crassiceps   infection , together with other published observations , suggest the possibility that diminishing granuloma formation in ncc by blocking sp , which contributes to granuloma formation and epileptogenic responses ,   may be beneficial in the treatment of this disease .
the current studies were performed to determine the contribution of sp and its specific receptor , nk1 , to granuloma development and proinflammatory cytokine production within granulomas arising in mice infected with t. crassiceps .
to begin to examine the contribution of sp signaling to granuloma formation in ncc , we measured granuloma volume in mice with normal and deficient sp signaling .
