( 2004a ) , who compared neoplecostomus corumba ( neoplecostomus sp . in that work ) and n. paranensis using allozyme electrophoresis . in view of the difficulty in identifying species of this genus , in the present study , two populations of neoplecostomus , one from so domingos stream of the grande river in the municipality of muzambinho , in minas gerais state , and another from paraitiguinha stream of the tiet river basin in the municipality of salespolis , so paulo state ( both in the upper paran river basin ) were compared using allozyme gel electrophoresis in order to improve our understanding of the biodiversity within this genus
according to thorpe and sol - cava ( 1994 ) , populations belonging to the same species have genetic identity values ( i ) > 0.85 , whereas those belonging to different genera have i < 0.35 and species belonging to the same genus have i values of 0.350.85 . the i value for neoplecostomus sp . 1 and neoplecostomus sp
for example , stochastic events such as genetic drift could lead to the fixation of alternative alleles ( kerr and wright , 1954 ) in these presumably small populations and may provide a reasonable explanation for the low intraspecific and high interspecific variation in neoplecostomus species .
