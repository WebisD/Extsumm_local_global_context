a 31-year - old obese female was initially treated for pseudotumor cerebri with placement of a lumbar peritoneal shunt in 2003 .
ventriculoperitoneal ( vp ) shunting is commonly utilized as a diversion procedure for patients with hydrocephalus .
retrieval and repositioning of a displaced vp shunt in the peritoneal cavity using laparoscopic techniques has been previously described . in the present case ,
the technique described was well tolerated without complication and resulted in improvement of clinical symptoms .
laparoscopy avoids laparotomy and may provide improved confirmation of shunt functionality and placement at the time of revision .
this approach also allowed us to simultaneously repair the fascial defect associated with the shunt entry site into the peritoneal cavity , allowing us to reap the benefits of decreased recurrence and decreased patient morbidity associated with this technique .
the advent of laparoscopy has afforded a minimally invasive approach that has resulted in decreased patient morbidity related to shunt placement .
vp shunts fail for a variety of reasons , including failure secondary to disconnection of abdominal tubing with migration of the tubing , most commonly further into the peritoneal cavity ; this occurs in 2.5% to 4% of shunts placed according to current published series .
