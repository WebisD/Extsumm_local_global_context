single implants restored with lithium disilicate crowns and zirconia abutments with titanium insert could with - stand maximum masticatory force in the incisive area when the preparation depth was 0.5 mm .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to investigate the change of fracture load of customized zirconia abutments with titanium insert according to the different preparation depths , with aging and chewing simulation .
the change of preparation depth was more influential than the chewing simulation on the fracture load of the customized zirconia abutment with titanium insert .
within the limitations of this in vitro study , the following conclusions could be drawn : regardless of chewing simulation , the circumferential preparation depth of 0.5 mm of zirconia abutments had a significantly higher fracture load than other groups .
the results revealed that increase of the preparation depth by 0.2 mm tended to decrease the fracture load by 68 n , while the aging and chewing simulations tended to cause decreases of 102 n. changes in the preparation depth of 0.2 mm had a higher effect than the aging and chewing simulations .
in the present study , the fracture loads of customized zirconia abutments with titanium inserts were investigated according to preparation depths and the performance of artificial aging ( thermocycling & chewing simulations ) . moreover , for representation of the ' crown - abutment - fixture complex ' , lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated , and the optimum preparation depth of the crown was also assessed .
