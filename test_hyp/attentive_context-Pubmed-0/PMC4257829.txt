pregnant women were frequently infected during these outbreaks ; epidemic clones infected 8 pregnant women and their offspring . however , during 2012 and 2013 , serotype 4b isolates of different genotypes also infected 5 pregnant women , resulting in 1 miscarriage , 3 premature newborns , and 1 stillborn infant and 1 premature newborn in a twin pregnancy . in summary , we defined 2 epidemiologically unrelated outbreaks of listeriosis caused by a rare type of l. monocytogenes that occurred at the same time in a small region of spain .
management of this frequently fatal disease requires careful investigation of the source of infection to stop its spread and prompt treatment of infected persons to prevent severe illness and death .
in gipuzkoa , 27 human listeriosis episodes were reported during january 2013february 2014 . all cases produced sepsis in the patients , except 1 case that produced diarrheal disease in a 34-year - old parturient woman who had undergone a splenectomy .
humans are usually infected after eating contaminated food , although the source of the infection is infrequently detected in sporadic cases . for outbreaks , after the epidemiologic survey , a food is usually implicated as the source of infection , but it is not always possible to obtain microbiological confirmation ( 11 ) . in this study , the strain ( same phenotype and genotype ) that caused the second outbreak was obtained from a recently consumed food in the home and in several unopened samples from the same batch of food . however , this source could not be identified as related to the first outbreak .
