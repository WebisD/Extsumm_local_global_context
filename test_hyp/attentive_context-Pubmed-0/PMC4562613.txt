the present preliminary study is the first to compare the advantages and disadvantages of these 3 methods ( est , endoscopic papillary large balloon dilatation ( eplbd ) , and eslbd ) , being the first to do so .
in conclusion , est , eplbd , and eslbd might clear cbd stones with equal efficacy and safety .
the proportion in severity was similar ( p=0.693 ) with no significant difference in the rates of post - ercp pancreatitis , cholangitis , and bleeding among the groups .
the procedural costs were also compared between the groups ; the costs of eplbd were higher than est and lower than eslbd ( p<0.001 ) .
a total of 92.9% , 91.8% , and 96.5% of the patients in the est , eplbd , and eslbd groups , respectively , had their stones cleared during the initial ercp ( p=0.519 ) .
table 3 shows the complications within 30 days after ercp ; they occurred in 4.7% , 4.7% , and 5.9% of the patients in the est , eplbd , and eslbd groups ( p=1.000 ) , respectively .
ml was used in 9.4% ( 8/85 ) , 14.1% ( 12/85 ) , and 8.2% ( 7/85 ) of the patients in the est , eplbd , and eslbd groups ( p=0.419 ) , respectively .
