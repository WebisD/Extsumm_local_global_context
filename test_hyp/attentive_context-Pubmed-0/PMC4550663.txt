these include the similarity of primate anatomy , physiology , susceptibility to low - dose aerosol infection , and , crucially , immune response to those of humans ( 31 , 32 ) . in this study , we used the rhesus macaque model to investigate mucosal and systemic immune responses induced following aerosol bcg vaccination . in doing so , we reveal features of the aerosol - induced immune response that may contribute to the enhanced protection reported in the literature and inform future vaccination strategies and the search for correlates of protection .
consequently , we intend to further investigate the efficacy of aerosol bcg vaccination and characterize the events following low - dose experimental m. tuberculosis infection to confirm the protection reported in the literature and further interrogate correlates of mucosal immunity and protection .
our results show that polyfunctional cd4 t cells are detected in the lung following aerosol vaccination and that the functional repertoire of cd4 and cd8 t cells induced by aerosol bcg was consistent with that reported in our prior studies of i.d .
the safety of delivering novel tb vaccines to rhesus macaques and healthy human volunteers has recently been established ( 69 ) . however , despite the excellent safety record of bcg , particular caution is warranted in the context of delivering live , attenuated bacilli to the lung and nasopharyngeal surfaces .
