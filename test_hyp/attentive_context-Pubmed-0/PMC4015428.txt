log epa and log ( epa  +  dha ) correlated with a decrease in hemoglobin a1c .
dha , docosahexaenoic acid ; epa , eicosapentaenoic acid . a decrease in hemoglobin a1c correlated with bmi ( r  =  0.396 , p  =  0.0013 ) , age ( r  =  0.275 p  =  0.0032 ) , hemoglobin a1c at baseline ( r  =  0.490 , p  <  0.0001 ) , log epa ( r  =  0.285 , p  =  0.0246 ) and log ( epa  +  dha ) ( r  =  0.260 , p  =  0.0411 ) . there were no significant differences in decrease in hemoglobin a1c between male and female patients ( 1.0    0.8% vs 1.0    0.9% , p  =  0.9758 ) . decrease in hemoglobin a1c was greater in patients treated with antidiabetic concomitant drugs compared with that in patients without those ( 1.1    0.9% vs 0.6    0.4% , p  =  0.0342 ) . in the multiple regression analysis to examine the effects of variables on the decrease in hemoglobin a1c , we included the following independent variables , which were significantly correlated with a decrease in hemoglobin a1c in the univariate analyses : age , bmi , hemoglobin a1c at baseline , usage of antidiabetic concomitant drugs and log epa .
