the primary aim of this research was to determine the reference values of cervical lns to guide elastographic studies not to establish the benign versus malignant nature of the lymph nodes .
after obtaining the approval of the ethical committee , patients referred to the radiology department for cervical vascular doppler ultrasonography examination from january to march 2013 were enrolled in this prospective study .
elastosonography is a user dependent technique closely related to experience . due to the shape of the neck ,
97 cervical lns of 89 consecutive patients ( 70 lns in 64 females , 27 lns in 25 males ; mean age 54 years old ; age range , 2184 years ) who were referred to our clinic for the examination of cervical vasculature were analysed by elastosonography .
the purpose of this study is to determine the reference sonoelastography values of cervical lns .
64 ( 66% ) of the lns were found on the right side and 33 ( 34% ) were found on the left side of the neck .
afterwards , elastographic images were given 1 of 4 elasticity scores ( ess ) based on the percentage of stiff areas modified from choi et al . which was introduced for the differential diagnosis of axillary lns in breast cancer .
