we report three cases of thyroid dysfunction related to the prolonged administration of gnrh agonist .
therefore , in the present case report , we describe three cases of thyroid dysfunction after the use of gnrh agonist . in the above cases , the administration of gnrh agonist showed the possibility of thyroid dysfunction , and
currently , gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is commonly used for various sex - hormone - related diseases ( uterine myoma , endometriosis , precocious puberty , dysfunctional uterine bleeding , assisted reproductive technology , etc . ) .
therefore attention should be paid to the thyroid in patients vulnerable to autoimmune thyroid disease when beginning the treatement of gnrh agonist .
the main mechanism of action is the change in the secretion of gonadotropin and sex hormones . in the initial administration , they are associated with an increase in estrogen due to the increase of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone , and with the prolonged administration , they are associated with estrogen reduction due to desensitization by down - regulation of gnrh receptor .
in addition , some case reports have shown that gnrh agonist - induced relative estrogen reduction may cause autoimmune thyroid disease by immune rebound [ 6 - 10 ] , but there have been no reports in the korean literature . here ,
