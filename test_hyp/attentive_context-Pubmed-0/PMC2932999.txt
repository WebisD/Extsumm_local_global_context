we have used structural and functional studies here to gain an understanding of the mechanism of resistance to the na inhibitors of influenza b viruses with mutations at residue 197 .
the influenza virus neuraminidase ( na , aaabbreviations : fu , fluorescent unit ; munana , 4-methylumbelliferyl - n - acetylneuraminic acid ; na , neuraminidase ; kdn , 2,3-difluoro-2-keto-3-deoxy - d - glycero - d - galactononulosonic acid . ec 3.2.1.18 ) functions in virus infection to remove sialic acid from receptors present on the surface of host cells . in the absence of na activity ,
we present here structures of b / perth/211/2001 nas with d ( b / perth d ) or e ( b / perth e ) at position 197 in the apo form and in complex with 3 and provide an insight into the mechanism of resistance of mutations at d197 .
furthermore , the structure of the b / perth e complex with 2 is presented , and from these data we propose the mechanism of reduced binding of 2 in wild type influenza b nas .
we demonstrate that although d197 does not interact directly with substrate or inhibitors , mutations of d197e and d197n in influenza b alter binding of substrate and all three na inhibitors 1 , 2 , and 3 , as shown by decreased specific activity and increased ki and ic50 values .
