a 60  year old man presented to our department with pain and swelling over lateral end of left clavicle ( fig . 1 , fig .
we have reported this case to emphasize the fact any expansile lytic lesion occurring in the lateral end of clavicle should be taken seriously and the diagnosis can be easily missed both clinically and radiographically if the clinician is not aware of the wide array of differential diagnosis which range from an infectious etiology like tuberulous osteomyelitis to a neoplastic etiology like giant cell tumour .
the clavicle is a rare site for bone tumors and shares its oncological behavior with that of flat bones rather than long bones .
there seems to be a difference in opinion regarding functional outcome after claviculectomy for tumour like lesions of clavicle and our case report further highlights the fact the claviculectomy without any reconstruction seems to be a good option with no disability noted in long term .
, the giant cell tumor is an aggressive potentially malignant lesion which means that its evolution based on histological features is unpredictable .
