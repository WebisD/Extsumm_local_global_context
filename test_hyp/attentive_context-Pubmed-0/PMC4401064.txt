gst activity in cystic liver tissue could be concerned as a biomarker for hydatid cyst diagnosis with other parameters of hydatidosis .
the prevalence of liver hydatid cyst was reported 4.7% in people of peru country using recombinant antigen , epc1 glutathione s - transferase [ repc1-gst ] , in western blot technique ( 10 ) .
however , the hydatid cyst diagnosis technique is under developing due to specificity and sensitivity problems . in the present study , gst enzyme activity of hydatid cyst protoscolices ( parasite ) ,
statistical t - test showed gst enzyme activity of parasite was lower than healthy liver tissues ( p < 0.05 ) .
protein concentration of healthy liver was higher than infected liver ( p < 0.05 ) .
healthy and cystic liver tissues were compared and mentioned gst enzyme importance for diagnostic biomarker in hydatid cyst disease .
extract samples of protoscolices , healthy and cystic liver tissues were analyzed by sds - page electrophoresis and the results are shown in fig .
significant higher gst specific activities in cystic liver samples was observed as compared with healthy liver ( p < 0.05 ) .
the mean values of protein concentrations and enzyme activities for parasite , healthy and infected liver samples are presented in table 1 .
