thus , an understanding between habitat variation and sandflies populations is essential , and to examine whether these changes can increase the risk of transmission of leishmania , we studied populations of sandflies in a conserved area and two distinct agroecosystems .
, changes in the determinants of transmission can lead to the development of new outbreaks .
these results clearly show that sandflies fauna exhibited changes in species number as well as population structure in degraded environments . as a result
moreover , the values for diversity and species richness decreased with an increasing degree of ecological disturbance , as observed with the cocoa ( 1.80 and 9 ) and orange agroecosystems ( 1.32 and 7 , resp . ) .
cluster analysis was performed to assess the segmentation of each capture , and we identified 2 groups of homogeneous captures with 46% similarity .
tukey 's test was performed for paired agroecosystems , specifically between forest and cocoa agroecosystems and cocoa and orange agroecosystems ( table 3 ) .
the simple correspondence analysis between sandflies species and agroecosystems identified a strong association between l. gomezi and l. atroclavata with disturbed agroecosystems and a strong association between l. ovallesi , l. walkeri , l. shannoni , l. hernandezi , l. panamensis , l. migonei , l. cayenensis , and l. pilosa with conserved agroecosystems ; species such as l. trinidadensis , l. olmeca nociva , and l. spinicrassa showed no association with any agroecosystem (  : 124.7 ; df = 30 ; p = 0.005 ) ( figure 4 ) . in the conserved agroecosystem ,
