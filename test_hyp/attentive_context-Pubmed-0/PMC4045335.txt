the present 
 study aims to explore the effects of rock glacier solute 
 fluxes on a high alpine lake within a crystalline - rock watershed . 

we applied comparative research design in the study of two neighboring 
 water bodies , lake rasass and the adjacent pond , with and without 
 a rock glacier in their mineralized catchments having similar soil 
 conditions and underlying geology .
in addition , we used chironomid - based 
 paleolimnological techniques to track long - term temporal trends in 
 the ecotoxicological state of both water bodies and to establish their 
 baseline conditions .
overall , 
 our findings illustrate that natural ard systems generated 
 by active rock glaciers in mineralized areas with sulfide - bearing 
 lithologies may seriously disturb lake ecosystems and endanger the 
 quality of drinking water in pristine alpine environments .
the results provide evidence that 
 the present adverse conditions 
 in the lake are not unprecedented in its holocene history and can not 
 be associated exclusively with global warming and enhanced thawing 
 of the rock glacier in recent years .
more adverse 
 effects may be expected in lakes situated at the toe of greater and 
 more active rock glaciers than the one in the ras catchment .
