in this study , the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of the rapid - acting insulin analog aspart , injected by either jet injection technique or by conventional insulin pen , were compared .
the time to maximal glucose - lowering effect , as represented by t - girmax , was reduced by > 50% when insulin was administered with the jet injector as compared with conventional insulin administration .
, the current study shows that when insulin is administered with a jet injector instead of a conventional insulin pen , a more rapid onset of insulin action can be achieved .
we found that the jet injector greatly enhanced the rate of insulin absorption , resulting in a truly immediate onset of action and approximately halving of the time to reach maximal glucose - lowering effect in comparison with conventional insulin administration .
however , the time to 50% of glucose disposal ( t - gir50% ) , representing the total duration of insulin action , was approximately 40 min shorter for insulin administration by jet injector than that by conventional insulin pen .
in addition , insulin administration by jet injection reduced the total duration of hyperinsulinemia and insulin action by 3040 min when compared with conventional insulin administration .
