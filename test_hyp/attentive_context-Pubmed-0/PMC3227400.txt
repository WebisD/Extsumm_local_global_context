lau and colleagues   have conceptualized a framework for aging in place safely and acknowledge the importance of multiple factors , including the biological and psychological characteristics of the individual , the network of social support , formal services , the need for medical services , and the structure of the home and neighborhood . this and other frameworks clearly recognize that aging in place strategies must consider not only the personal ( micro ) environment , including housing , but also community and structural components as well   .
lawler   suggests that aging in place strategies can minimize inappropriate care and work best as a comprehensive and holistic approach to the needs of aging individuals and communities .
  the results of this study reinforce the importance of social connectedness , participation , and integration in creating and maintaining elder - friendly communities and suggest that the findings are areas of concern not just for the old - old , but for recent and soon - to - be retired individuals wishing to maintain life satisfaction .
the study suggests the possibility of using more nontraditional research techniques for gathering community level data such as the kinds of findings generated from the world caf process . while creating and fostering elder - friendly communities can be a long and ongoing process
