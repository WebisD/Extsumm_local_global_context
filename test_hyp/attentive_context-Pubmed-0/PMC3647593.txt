in general , women tended to have better glycemic control and adherence to recommended self - care compared to men .
in adjusted logistic regression models of self - care activities ( figure 2(a ) ) , women were more likely to report high fruit and vegetable consumption ( aor 1.36 , 95% ci 1.151.61 ) , blood glucose testing ( 1.27 , 95% ci 1.041.55 ) , and self - foot examination ( aor 1.32 , 95% ci 1.111.57 ) but less likely to report fatty food consumption ( aor 0.69 , 95% ci 0.590.80 ) and regular exercise ( aor 0.72 , 95% ci 0.620.85 ) compared to men . based on adjusted logistic regression models of 3,045 patients with at least one known diabetic complication , men and women had similar odds of hemoglobin a1c and microalbuminuria testing ( table 4 ) .
in contrast , ldl testing was less frequent in women compared to men ; only 52.6% of women had their ldl checked in the previous year compared to 59.0% of men ( p < 0.001 ) .
this study also examined whether sex differences in diabetes process of care measures and self - care activities were detectable in the subgroup of subjects with a history of diabetic complications , a particularly high - risk group for adverse outcomes .
