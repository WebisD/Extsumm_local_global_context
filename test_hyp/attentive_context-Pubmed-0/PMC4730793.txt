therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of maternal restraint stress on the levels of nkcc1 and kcc2 , as well as gabaa receptors 1 and 5 subunits in the hippocampus of the offspring to provide insights about the involved mechanisms of maternal stress as a cause of dysregulation of gabaergic synapses that are known to be associated with the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases at adulthood .
pregnant rats were divided into two groups ; 1 ) control group , 2 ) maternal restraint stress group ( n  =  4/group ) . for the restraint stress ,
as we demonstrated , fetal exposure to maternal stress hormones delays structural and functional development of gaba transmission in the rat pup 's hippocampus during the preadolescence period .
moreover , prenatal stress also increases gabaa receptor 5 subunit expression throughout the preadolescence period , which may underlie the learning and memory impairments in the offspring at adulthood . in summary , we have provided an explanation of certain prenatal factors mediating structural and functional development of the gabaergic synapse that may be the link between prenatal stress and the emergence of neuro - psychiatric disorders at adulthood .
