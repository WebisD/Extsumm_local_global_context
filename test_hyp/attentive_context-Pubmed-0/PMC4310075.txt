the aim of this investigation is to compare the cord blood lipid concentration in term , late preterm and preterm newborns in a sample of iranian neonates .
term infants had the highest level of triglycerides ( 47.03 mg / dl ) , whereas preterm infants had its lowest concentration ( 61.69 mg / dl ) .
the lowest amount of cholesterol content was documented in term infants ( 72.51 mg / dl ) .
no significant difference existed in the mean level of hdl - c , apolipoprotein a and apolipoprotein b levels in the three studied groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
neonates with a gestational age of 37 weeks were considered as term , those with gestational age of < 34 weeks as preterm , and those with 34 gestational age < 37 weeks , as late preterm neonates .
this cross - sectional study was conducted in 2013 among 100 neonates in isfahan , iran .
cord blood concentrations of triglycerides , total cholesterol and ldl - c were significantly different in term , late preterm , and preterm newborns [ table 1 ] .
preterm infants had a high level of cholesterol concentrations . in this investigation , we did not document significant difference in the mean cord blood level of hdl - c , apolipoprotein a and apolipoprotein b levels in the total study group .
