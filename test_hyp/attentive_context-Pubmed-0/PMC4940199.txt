a total of 60 patients reporting to goa dental college and hospital from march 2013 to december 2014 were included in this prospective study and were randomly divided into 2 equal groups based on the type of approach employed for fracture fixation ( group a , transoral approach ; group b , transbuccal approach ) .
28 patients in group b had a score of 1 ( pre - trauma occlusion ) , compared to 16 patients in group a ( p=0.027 , significant ) .
the mean age in this study was 26.73 years ( range , 17 - 53 years ) , with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life ( n=46 , 76.7% ) which showed male predominance ( n=58 , 96.7% ) .
this is in accordance with our study , which reported 1 case ( 3.3% ) of hypertrophic scarring and no incidence of facial nerve palsy in group b. three months after surgery , only two patients in group b had an infection , as compared to six patients in group a. this was due to the infected plate , which was retrieved under local anesthesia .
two patients in group a had a score of 3 ( major discrepancy ) , compared to no patients in group b.(table 5 ) the occlusal discrepancy was noted only in the first week postsurgery in either group and was corrected using elastic traction in all patients .
