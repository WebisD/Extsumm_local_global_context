the main implication of our study is that oncologists , surgeons , and cancer patients should be aware of the excess postoperative mortality risk related to diabetes when considering treatment options .
second , we found no studies evaluating the effect of diabetes on postoperative mortality in women with breast or endometrial cancer .
this additional risk was present across a range of cancers and a range of surgical cancer treatments .
we searched medical literature analysis and retrieval system online ( medline ) and excerpta medica database ( embase ) from inception to 1 july 2009 for articles evaluating the effect of diabetes on any prognostic outcome in cancer patients .
our overall search strategy included terms for diabetes ( e.g. , diabetes , glucose intolerance , hyperglycemia ) , cancer ( e.g. , cancer , malignant neoplasm ) , and prognosis ( e.g. , mortality , survival , recurrence ) and was limited to english language human studies .
our literature search yielded 8,828 articles , of which 20 were eligible for inclusion in the present systematic review of the risk of preexisting diabetes on short - term postoperative mortality in cancer patients after initial surgical treatment .
