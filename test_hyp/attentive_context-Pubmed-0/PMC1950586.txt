however , we believe that an arthroscopic approach involves less post - operative morbidity and allows patients , including professional athletes , to return to high - functioning lifestyles . the purpose of this study was to define associated pathologies and determine if professional athletes could return to high - level athletics following arthroscopic decompression of fai .
recent developments , particularly by ganz and colleagues , have enlightened us to the pathology of fai and the associated treatment options . in order to treat high - demand patients with fai
additional studies are needed to determine the effect on long - term joint degeneration of early surgical intervention to treat fai .
post - operative improvement , as quantified by the modified harris hip score , was present in all classes of athletes and in athletes undergoing any arthroscopic procedure ( removal of loose bodies , debridement of ligamentum teres , excision of osteophyte , labral excision , microfracture , chondroplasty ) .
a retrospective chart review was performed of all professional athletes presenting for arthroscopic treatment of fai by the senior author between october 2000 and september 2005 .
this study has demonstrated that full return to professional competitive sport is possible following arthroscopic treatment of fai .
