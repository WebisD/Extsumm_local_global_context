as a late bloomer , development of mrna therapeutics benefits from a plethora of related knowledge on similar delivery systems . advancing from passive targeting strategies employed for most mrna nanoparticle tumor vaccine to date , active targeting of mrna nanoparticles to dcs will further improve current therapeutic outcome for the treatment of cancer .
they include the optimization of the mrna molecular structure   , direct in vivo administration of mrna   , delivery routes   , evaluation of rationally designed gene carriers   , and , recently , self - replicating rna . along this developmental trajectory
, dc - targeted nanoparticle gene delivery systems may be an imminent next step forward for nonviral tumor vaccine delivery . in this brief report ,
this will be followed by a brief discussion on three promising dc receptors that are suitable for targeted delivery of mrna nanoparticles for tumor vaccination .
messenger rna ( mrna ) has achieved great success in an increasing number of biological applications .
practicable conjugation strategies as well as target receptors reviewed in this paper will provide a convenient reference to facilitate future development of targeted mrna nanoparticle vaccine .
apropos , the notion of nonviral genetic vaccination is also increasingly associated with mrna instead of dna . given a mature drug and gene delivery field , mrna nanoparticle delivery science is often deferred or closely compared with dna and sirna systems   . however , as various reports have shown , unique properties of mrna delivery exist   and continue to be a relevant research focus today . mrna delivery science has made significant progress since the first demonstration of cell based mrna tumor vaccine delivery via rna loaded dcs .
