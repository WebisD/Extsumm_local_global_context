, we reiterate the importance of high clinical suspicion in making this rare diagnosis , the consequences of delayed diagnosis and the role of biopsy of a suprapubic tract with clinical features of malignancy .
about 96% are symptomatic at presentation with a history of stricture disease in more than half and sexually transmitted disease in one fourth of all patients .
rarely , it can manifest as a periurethral abscess , fistula , or fungating perineal tumor . while urethral carcinoma is known to aggressively infiltrate periurethral tissue ; concomitant involvement of suprapubic catheter tract has not been reported in the literature . in this paper
a 65-year - old diabetic male with a long history of urethral stricture developed rapid worsening of his lower urinary tract symptoms and noticed a painful swelling in his upper scrotum for 2 weeks .
our patient had a history of long - standing urethral stricture complicated by a periurethral abscess .
locally advanced urethral scc must be excised with a wide margin along with flap reconstruction of the defect when indicated , to allow optimal local oncologic clearance .
our anecdotal experience leads us to recommend biopsy of the suprapubic tract whenever examination arouses suspicion , especially when urinary tract malignancy is present .
