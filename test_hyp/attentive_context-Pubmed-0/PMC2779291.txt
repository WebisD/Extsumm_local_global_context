we describe a case of primary rectal syphilis which was suspected to be rectal cancer .
the vdrl quantitative test was 1:64 and the fta - abs igm and igg test was positive . a human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv )
most physicians have a tendency to consider rectal ulceration as a neoplasm ( 7 , 8) . similarly in our case symptoms and signs suggested rectal neoplasia and the clinical history did not reveal homosexuality .
therefore , it is difficult to diagnose and physicians occasionally might prescribe inappropriate treatments ( 5 , 6 ) . in this paper
a repeat biopsy was done and the histologic result showed focal lymphoid hyperplasia . a vdrl quantitative test after 3 months was 1:1 .
follow - up sigmoidoscopy after 1 month showed nearly complete regression of the chancre ( fig .
however , after the vdrl test the patient confessed that he had been raped by a homosexual male . therefore , when rectal syphilis is suspected ( i.e. , perianal condyloma acuminatum associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy ) the history of sexual intercourse , especially rectal intercourse , has to be taken .
inguinal lymphadenopathy need not require an initial biopsy when evidence of regional infection is present . usually after antibiotic therapy of at least 4 weeks
