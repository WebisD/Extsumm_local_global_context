the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of short - term subcutaneous administration of anti - tnf drugs on epcs number in patients with active ra .
the results of our study demonstrate that short - term treatment of ra with tnf inhibitors is associated to an increase in circulating epcs concurrently to a proportional decrease of disease activity ; these findings suggest that therapeutic intervention aimed at suppressing the inflammatory process might also positively affect the  health  of endothelial barrier . in ra patients , traditional risk factors , genetic predisposition , and inflammatory mechanisms
our results enhance the current knowledge on the impairment of endothelial biomarkers in ra , as evaluated by epcs and adma .
an effective treatment with anti - tnf agents , aimed at reducing disease activity , seems to contribute to the improvement of endothelial barrier function .
aimed at evaluating , ex vivo and in vitro , number and function of endothelial progenitors in 13 patients with impaired endothelial function ; all patients were treated with methotrexate , and 6 out of 13 were also taking anti - tnf drugs .
no significant correlation between epcs and das28 values was detected ( p = 0.056 ) ; however , an inverse correlation between mean increase in epcs number and mean decrease of das28 after 3 months of anti - tnf therapy was observed ( r = 0.56 , p = 0.04 ) ( figure 3 ) .
