mating kinetics has been previously documented to contribute to nonrandom mating in yeast   . here , we tested the null hypothesis that the sexes of t. thermophila mate randomly with respect to sex of a partner .
our experimental design allowed individuals a limited amount of time to choose between two compatible sexes ( or not to mate at all ) , and we recorded the number of times each compatible sex was chosen as a partner . under the conditions tested , we found that this species mates randomly with respect to sex .
discovery of mating bias among sexes in t. thermophila could have delivered insights into affinities between sexes at the molecular level and facilitated predictions about the structural differences between the sex - specific molecules , which are currently unknown .
interaction between a sex - specific ligand on the surface of one sex and the receptor on the surface of the other sex is hypothesized to be the underlying mechanism of pairing between sexes , but awaits empirical support .
alternatively , random mating found in our study may reflect presence of a unique receptor for each sex - specific ligand and thus lack of competition between the sexes .
