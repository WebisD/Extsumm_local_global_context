we report a case of severe de novo cryoglobulinaemic mononeuritis multiplex ( mnm ) that occurred during week 30 of antiviral treatment for chronic hcv infection .
chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection is an important cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and a major indication for liver transplantation . despite the exciting and promising discovery of direct - acting antiviral agents , pegylated interferon alpha ( peg - ifn ) and ribavirin
cryoglobulins had been undetectable in the pre - treatment period and at the time of presentation the patient was hcv rna - negative .
in summary we report a patient with hcv - related cirrhosis who developed de novo mnm associated with cryoglobulinaemia during week 30 of antiviral therapy , having achieved evr . while interferon therapy is the treatment of choice for hcv - related mnm ,
nonetheless , such patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis present a challenging dilemma as the inevitable virological rebound after discontinuation of antiviral therapy can have grave implications .
occurrence of de novo cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis after successful viral suppression late in the course of interferon therapy is unusual , especially with use of the pegylated form .
the de novo development of mnm during hcv therapy with undetectable hcv rna is most unusual .
