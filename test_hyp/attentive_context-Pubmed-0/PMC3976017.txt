the objective of this study was to compare hippotherapy to the use of a horseback riding 
 simulator ( joba , panasonic inc . , japan ) with respect to their effects on the static and 
 dynamic balance of children with cp .
, the horseback riding simulator could be a useful alternative to hippotherapy 
 for improving of static and dynamic balance of children with cp .
this study included 26 children with cp who were receiving physical therapy at the h 
 horseback riding center and the n horseback riding center in kyung - ki in korea .
the hippotherapy group carried out anterior - sitting , posterior - sitting , and 
 side - sitting exercises for 10  min each while horseback riding at a walking pace ( 6  km / h ) . 

first , the number of subjects was small , and second , 
 only static and dynamic balance were evaluated . in spite of these limitations , our results 
 show that the use of a horseback riding simulator can be a good intervention for children 
 with cp .
our data indicate that both hippotherapy and use of the horseback riding simulator improved 
 the static and dynamic balance of children with cp .
