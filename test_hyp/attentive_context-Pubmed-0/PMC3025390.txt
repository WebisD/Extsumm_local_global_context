the current results support the view   that fs cells play a major role in regulating the ionic composition and volume of the interstitial and follicular fluid and suggest that nhe2 serves as an absorptive na / h exchanger on the luminal surface of fs cells that counters fluid accumulation resulting from cftr - mediated secretion of anions .
thus , if ion secretion serves an important function in the pituitary , as suggested by studies on the pig cystic fibrosis model and human infants with cystic fibrosis , then one might expect that disease conditions or drugs that impair ion secretion or homeostatic regulation of the volume and ionic composition of the canalicular fluid would affect pituitary function and human health .
the most prominent histological finding consequent to gene - targeted ablation of the nhe2 na / h exchanger was the dilation of the canaliculi formed by fs cells in the pars distalis of the anterior pituitary .
given the known absorptive functions of nhe2   , the expression of nhe2 mrna in pars distalis and at lesser levels in pars intermedia , both of which are reported to contain fs cells , and the previously demonstrated transcellular fluxes of ions and water across fs cells   , the data suggest that nhe2 serves as an important absorptive na / h exchanger on the luminal surface of fs cells of the anterior pituitary .
