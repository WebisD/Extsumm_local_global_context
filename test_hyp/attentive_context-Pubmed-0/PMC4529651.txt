, we share our experience at an urban level 1 trauma center of managing a hemodynamically stable pediatric patient who sustained a grade iii / iv splenic laceration following blunt trauma with follow - up imaging demonstrative of splenic pseudoaneurysm and proposed algorithm to manage such a case .
splenic pseudoaneurysms ( spa ) are a serious sequela of blunt traumatic injury to the spleen .
the limited existing literature leaves us with a still unclear algorithm for the management of non - operative blunt splenic trauma in pediatric patients .
we believe that our proposed management algorithm timely detect formation of delayed spa formation and addresses the possible fatal disease course of pediatric spa .
although the american pediatric surgical association does not recommend routine follow - up imaging in pediatric trauma patients regardless of grade of injury , several reviews have described the potential benefits of follow - up ct imaging for detection of pseudoaneurysm . here
questions still remain regarding the timing of repeat imaging for diagnosis of spa following non - operative blunt splenic trauma , which patients should be imaged , and how to manage spa upon diagnosis .
however , the management in pediatric patients is poorly defined . with regards to spa ,
