thus , pai-1 may contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance and may be a causal link between obesity and cvd.  there are few studies which have evaluated adipokines in indian population.  hence , we studied adiponectin and pai-1 levels and their correlation with various parameters in subjects with ms .
in the present study , subjects with ms had higher bmi , bfm and percent body fat , which is reflected in lower level of adiponectin and higher level of pai-1 . also , they had increased insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion compared to healthy controls .
plasma pai-1 levels are elevated in obesity and insulin resistance , are positively correlated with features of the ms , and predict future risk for type 2 diabetes and cvd .
subjects with ms were associated with higher hscrp level , emphasizing low - grade systemic inflammatory state .
lifestyle measures have been shown to improve insulin resistance , insulin secretion and various components and effects of ms,  and hence there is an urgent need for public health measures to prevent the ongoing epidemic of diabetes and cvd .
roc curve analysis revealed best prediction value of pai-1 at 25.0 ng / ml , with a sensitivity of 92% , specificity of 96% , accuracy of 95% , positive predictive value of 92% , negative predictive value of 96% and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 22.9 and 0.08 , respectively ( roc 0.975 , se 0.0178 , 95% ci = 0.9421.009 ) .
