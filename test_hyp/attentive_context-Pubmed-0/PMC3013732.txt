in addition , we have added enrichment profile of various transcription factors obtained from chip - seq data sets . these promoters along with their annotations are provided as a user - friendly database , where each known and chip - seq promoter is linked to a new interface for visualization of enrichment profile . here , we describe the updates of our mpromdb , which enables users to study promoter activity at tissue / cell centric level for human and mouse genome .
we have removed chip  chip results and added active rnap - ii promoters identified after analyzing six different cell types of human and 10 different cell / tissue types of mouse chip - seq experiments performed with rnap - ii antibody .
several high - throughput technologies , such as cap analysis gene expression ( cage ) , chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) followed by microarray analysis ( chip  chip ) , ( 6,7 ) , and more recently , chip coupled with sequencing ( chip - seq ) ( 8) and sequencing of cdnas ( rna - seq ) ( 5 ) , are enabling the genome - wide identification of alternative promoters and their patterns of use . however , these high - throughput approaches need to be applied with caution because of the inherent problems with each method ( 9 ) . in our recent study , we have shown that a combination of chip - seq and computational technique provides a better approach to annotate active promoters ( 9,10 ) .
