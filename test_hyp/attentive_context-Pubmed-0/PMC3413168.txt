the purpose of this feasibility study was to quantify changes in lumbar spinal anatomy using computed tomography ( ct ) following decompression with the io - flex system versus hemilaminotomy with foraminotomy ( hl ) in cadaveric lumbar specimens .
the minimally invasive io - flex system yields significantly better decompression of the lateral recess and foraminal area in cadaveric specimens with lss , without extensive removal of the stabilizing posterior spinal elements , including the facet joint , compared with traditional hl .
hl resulted in removal of 83% greater laminar area ( p < 0.01 ) , including resection of the structural pars interarticularis and removal of 95% more bone in the central canal ( p < 0.001 ) versus the io - flex system .
ligamentum flavum area ( 79% and 83% , p = 0.94 ) were observed for the io - flex system and hl , respectively .
decreases in facet width were approximately threefold greater in nondiseased ( p < 0.01 ) and stenotic ( p = 0.03 ) specimens following hl versus the io - flex system . in nondiseased specimens , facet area was similarly decreased after each treatment ( 11% versus 14% , p = 0.94 ) . however , decreases in joint cross - sectional area were significantly less following use of the io - flex system ( 3% ) versus hl ( 7% , p < 0.01 , tables 1 and 2 ) . in nondiseased cadaver specimens , similar increases in soft tissue canal area ( 47% and 56% , p = 0.16 ) and decreases in
