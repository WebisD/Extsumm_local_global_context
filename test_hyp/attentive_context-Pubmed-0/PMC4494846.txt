5electropolymerization of pyrrole ( a ) and thiophene ( b ) electropolymerization of pyrrole ( a ) and thiophene ( b ) the morphologies of the polypyrrole and polythiophene fibers were investigated using a scanning electron microscope ( leo 1430vp ; carl zeiss smt , oberkochen , germany ) coupled with a backscattered electron ( bse ) detector .
all chemicals and reagents were of high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) or analytical grade .
4chemical structures of ppy ( a ) and pth ( b ) spme fiber coatings chemical structures of ppy ( a ) and pth ( b ) spme fiber coatings polymerization was performed using medical steel wires as working electrodes . an ag / ag electrode was applied as a reference electrode , with platinum net bent into a cylinder as a counterelectrode . for ppy , a potential range from 0.2 to + 2.5  v and seven scans
polypyrrole ( ppy ) and polythiophene ( pth ) coatings were synthesized by electropolymerization with a linear sweep voltammetry technique .
the three - electrode cell was filled with electrolyte solution consisting of 100  mm pyrrole / thiophene ( fig .  4 ) and 250  mm tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in acetonitrile.fig .
