a 53-year - old man presented with transient acute onset of left - sided numbness and speech disturbance one week prior to admission .
spontaneous recanalization of the occluded mca has been a common finding in acute ischemic stroke .
the angiographic changes in our patient illustrate that the chronic mca occlusion were spontaneously recanalized by an unknown mechanism within 21 months , with a good clinical outcome .
the incidence , mechanism , and ideal management of this extraordinary finding remain unclear . through this rare case , further investigation and studies into the underlying mechanism of spontaneous recanalization should be performed .
he also has an incidental saccular aneurysm at left posterior communicating artery ( p - com ) origin .
after two months , the left p - com aneurysm was managed by the microsurgical aneurysmal neck clipping and there were no developing or new neurologic symptoms after surgery .
the brain cta of 21 months after neck clipping developed recanalization of the previously occluded right mca .
these findings were compatible with the long - standing stage of the occlusion of mca rather than the acute occlusion .
the brain single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) showed mildly decreased perfusion in right middle cerebral artery territory and the vascular reserve was also decreased mildly after acetazolamide injection ( fig .
