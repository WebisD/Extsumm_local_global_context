the current study aimed to investigate the fungicidal effect of uv radiation on the growth of dermatophytes isolated from nails , considering the low efficacy of current treatment options and ease of exposing nails to uv light .
uv - a , uv - b and uv - c seem to be effective in decreasing colony growth in some prevalent fungi , which caused onychomycosis in the patients .
if there were enough samples , by using different types and doses of irradiation such as uv - a uv - b and uv - c for every single nail sample separately , the current study could directly examine the effects of radiation on them , but since the volume of samples was low , they were just cultured after the isolation of fungal strains and it was possible to evaluate different types and doses of irradiation in the isolated strains .
continuous irradiation with the uv - a and uv - b doses used in the study did not completely suppress the growth of the isolates , but higher intensities of uv - c light inhibited the growth of t. rubrum .
of the two t. rubrum isolates ( figure 1 ) , type 1 was less sensitive to uv - a and uv - c , and more sensitive to uv - b .
