preoperative superselective renal artery embolization helps to prevent excessive bleeding complications during organ - preserving surgery , it allows the preservation of a maximum amount of functioning renal tissue and it enables easy detection of the tumor site via the discoloration ; thus , simple enucleation is then feasible during the operation . in conclusion , preoperative superselective renal artery embolization can be an effective tool to facilitate organ - preserving surgery in a case of a horseshoe kidney with renal cell carcinoma .
radical nephrectomy is the standard therapy for renal cell carcinoma ( 8) . in cases of neoplasm in a horseshoe kidney , however , there is a place for limited resection or heminephrectomy , with special attention being paid to the abnormal arteries and the renal pelvis ( 8) .
a 59-year - old man presented with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varix bleeding . a ct scan
the horseshoe kidney is probably the most common of all renal fusion anomalies ( 3 ) .
the tumor was confined to the kidney and it proved to be a renal cell carcinoma , grade 2 ( fig .
this is especially true when preoperative renal artery embolization is necessary and a part of the organ has to be removed due to malignant disease while the maximal amount of functioning renal tissue needs to be preserved .
