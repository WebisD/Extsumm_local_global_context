we report a case of bilateral choroidal osteoma - macular in the right eye and peripapillary with macular involvement in the left eye along with high myopia and posterior staphyloma in a male child associated with a cnv membrane in the left eye treated with the off - label use of intravitreal bevacizumab ( avastin ; genentech , san francisco , ca , usa ) .
we report a male child diagnosed with bilateral choroidal osteoma , high myopia and secondary choroidal neovascularization ( cnv ) membrane in one eye .
on review of the literature we were unable to find a similar case of co - existant choroidal osteoma and posterior staphyloma reported earlier .
this case highlights the need for careful examination when presented with a case of choroidal osteoma filling the depression of a posterior staphyloma thereby making it appear flat rather than a typical elevated lesion .
co - existence of posterior staphyloma made the clinical diagnosis of choroidal osteoma difficult due to the osteoma filling the depression of the posterior staphyloma .
bevacizumab may have better penetration in these cases due to a very thinned and degenerated rpe / bruch 's membrane complex.8 there are reports of cnv secondary to choroidal osteoma in adult patients treated with intravitreal bevacizumab.89 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a choroidal osteoma induced cnv treated with bevacizumab in a young child .
