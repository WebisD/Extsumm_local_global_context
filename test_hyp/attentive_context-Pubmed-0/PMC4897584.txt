the subject of ideals in topological space has been studied by kuratowski   and vaidyanathaswamy .
an ideal  on a topological space ( x ,  ) is a nonempty collection of subsets of x which satisfies ( i ) a   and b  a implies b   and ( ii ) a   and b   implies a  b  . given a topological space ( x ,  ) with an ideal  on x and if (x ) is the set of all subsets of x , a set operator (  ) : (x )  (x ) , called a local function   of a with respect to  and  , is defined as follows : for a  x , a( ,  ) = { x  xu   } , for every { u  (x ) } where (x ) = { u  x  u}. a kuratowski closure operator cl ( ) for a topology (x ,  ) , called the -topology , finer than  is defined by cl(a ) = a  a( ,  ) ; when there is no chance for confusion , we will simply write a for a( ,  ) and  for ( ,  ) . if  is an ideal on x , then ( x ,  ,  )
