initiatives such as the surviving sepsis campaign , launched in 2002 as a collaborative initiative of the european society of intensive care medicine , the international sepsis forum , and the society of critical care medicine , aim to effectively reduce risk of death from severe sepsis and septic shock .
recently , new treatment approaches based on interventions for coagulation or inflammation have failed to improve survival in sepsis .
a deeper understanding of the processes leading to sepsis is necessary before we can design an effective suite of interventions .
although diffuse and limited , current available information supports the development of large comprehensive studies aimed to urgently evaluate immunological monitoring as a tool to prevent or treat sepsis , and thereby to diminish the morbidity and mortality associated with this severe condition .
, two phases have been described in sepsis : an initial systemic inflammatory response syndrome followed by the negative feedback of a secondary compensatory anti - inflammatory response syndrome .
nonetheless , although substantial benefits raised from the implementation of this campaign have been obtained , much work remains if we are to realise the full potential promised by this strategy .
the potential role of immunological monitoring in this disease has not been appropriately considered to the present moment . for years
