therefore , in order to identify whether bdnf could prevent immune rejection after peripheral nerve xenotransplantation and facilitate the nerve regeneration , we performed nerve xenotransplantation from rats to mice and found a dramatic reduction of natural killer ( nk ) cells , b cells , type 1 t helper ( th1 ) cells , and type 17 t helper ( th17 ) cells , while a remarkable increase of natural killer t ( nkt ) lymphocytes , type 2 t helper ( th2 ) cells , and regulatory t cells ( tregs ) was observed in the spleen of xenotransplanted mice treated with bdnf compared to that in mice receiving xenotransplantation only .
in summary , the current study demonstrated that the number of nk cells , th1 cells , th17 cells , and b cells in the xenotransplated nerves was significantly reduced by bdnf , while the number of nkt , th2 cells , and tregs in the xenotransplanted spleen was significantly increased by bdnf .
it was found that the number of nk cells , t cells , cd3+cd4 + t cells , cd3+cd4 t cells , th1 cells , th17 cells , and b cells was significantly increased in the mice receiving xenotransplantation and that bdnf could significantly suppress upregulation of the aforementioned t cells and b cells in the xenotransplanted mice .
