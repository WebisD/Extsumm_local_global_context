dental operating microscope is used to bypass the fractured instrument in the middle canal of a three canaled mandibular canine with the patients consent .
however , certain internal and external morphological variations in the mandibular canine like single or bifid roots with two or three canals have been reported in the literature . till date , no case report on management of two rooted three canaled mandibular canine with a fractured instrument has been reported in the literature . in the documented case ,
thus the present case report highlights the endodontic management of an unusual case of mandibular canine with two roots and three canals .
a 38-year - old healthy asian woman was referred to the endodontic clinic by a general dentist .
so it is important to note the internal and external root canal morphological variations so that similar anatomy may be predicted and managed successfully . sometimes retrieval of a fractured instrument is impossible or undesirable . in these cases , bypassing the instrument under magnification is a valid alternative , which can lead to a favorable outcome as presented in the given case .
it also highlights the need for use of dental operating microscope and ultrasonics in locating the elusive canal orifices .
