also , further studies will be necessary to determine the responses of other inflammatory mediators ( e.g. , nitric oxide , macrophage inflammatory protein-1 , etc . ) during endotoxemia . in conclusion , the difference of cardiopulmonary dysfunction between normal and stz - induced diabetic rats was minor whereas the tnf- levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased more markedly in diabetic rats receiving an lps challenge .
, we used type 1-like diabetic rats to investigate hemodynamic dysfunction and lung injury after intravenous lps infusion . also , the changes in tnf- in serum and lung lavage fluid were determined .
animals were randomly assigned to four groups ( 24 rats for each group ) : ( a ) normal rats receiving 0.9% normal saline administration ( ns ) , ( b ) normal rats receiving lps administration ( nl ) , ( c ) diabetic rats receiving normal saline administration ( ss ) , and ( d ) diabetic rats receiving lps administration ( sl ) .
after administration of lps , the survival time of stz - treated rats was markedly shorter than that of control rats ( 180.0  14.6  min versus 224.4  17.9  min , p = 0.027 ) . also , the survival rate of diabetic rats was significantly lower than the rate for control rats ( figure 1 ) .
