the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of three self - etching dentine - bonding agents ( g bond , clearfil s bond and clearfil se bond x ) with a three - dimensional cell culture and perfusion conditions that were not used in the previous study.3 the hypothesis tested was that different self - etching dentine bonding agents have different cytotoxic profiles .
all three self - etching dentine - bonding agents were non - toxic compared with the negative control group ( p>.05 ) . these agents could be used clinically in cases where there is more than .5 mm of remaining dentine above the pulp .
in a previous study , the cytotoxicity levels of self - etching dentine - bonding agents ( g bond , clearfil se bond x and clearfil s bond ) were evaluated using the agar overlay technique .
vitrebond was more toxic than g bond , clearfil se bond x and clearfil s bond ( p<.01 ) , whereas the experimental group did not have any toxicity compared with the negative control group ( p>.05 ) .
our study used a dentine model and three - dimensional cell cultures that have been previously described by ulker and sengun.14 cell perfusion was limited by the blood circulation inside the tooth cavity and was equal to 20 - 82.4 ml / min/100 grams of tissue.15 it has been reported that perfusing the chamber with 5 ml medium / h did not decrease toxicity but can lead to increased cell death or cell disruption.16 therefore , in the present study , the perfusion conditions included a cell feed flow rate of 2.0 ml / h . at this flow rate
