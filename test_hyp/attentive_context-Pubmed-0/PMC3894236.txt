the importance of leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) stimulated signaling in mouse embryonic stem cell ( esc ) culture in vitro has long been recognized . by activating janus kinase ( jak ) and
the induced pluripotent stem cell ( ipsc ) technology provides a powerful tool to reprogram somatic cells such as skin fibroblasts to a pluripotent state , and brings us much closer to the establishment of personalized , cell - based therapy for the treatment of currently incurable diseases such as diabetes and neural degenerative diseases . in many aspects ,
in addition , these studies provided important insight for further understanding of the mechanism behind lif regulated esc pluripotency . in this review , we will summarize the current knowledge on the role of lif and especially jak - stat3 signaling pathway in esc pluripotency maintenance and in somatic cell reprogramming .
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) , lif plays essential roles in the generation and maintenance of mouse pluripotent embryonic stem cells which are capable of infinite self - renewal and differentiation to any cell type of the three - germ layers of an embryo . over the past two decades
