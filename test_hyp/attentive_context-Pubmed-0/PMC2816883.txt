therefore , we did this study to delineate the change in the incidence of cld according to the gradual reduction of postnatal dexamethasone use in vlbwi in our nicu .
therefore , as long as the possibility that postnatal dexamethasone produces neurodevelopmental adverse effect remains , it may be desirable to refrain from the routine use of postnatal dexamethasone for the prevention of cld and restrict postnatal dexamethsone therapy to the ventilator - dependent vlbwi who aggravates relentlessly clinically and radiologically beyond the second week of life .
however , the length of simv and supplemental oxygen , and mortality showed a significant trend to decrease as the time elapses ( p<0.001 , p<0.001 , p<0.01 , respectively ) , while the extent of initial physiological weight loss and the length of ncpap revealed a significant trend to increase as the time passes ( p<0.001 ) .
five hundred fifty nine vlbwi weighing less than 1,500 g at birth who were admitted to nicu unit at samsung medical center between november 1994 and december 2002 were enrolled . to see the trends over time
this favorable outcome is thought to be attributable to the introduction of other measures for the reduction of the lung injury such as early weaning from simv to ncpap and fluid restriction therapy in the early postnatal period .
