here we describe an outbreak of candidemia caused by a nac species , which involved six neonates over a short period of 11 days in neonatal intensive care unit ( nicu ) of our hospital , a rural tertiary care center in srinagar garhwal , uttarakhand state , india .
candida species have emerged as one of the most common causes of blood stream infections ( bsi ) among neonates and account for 9 - 13% of such infections , with most of the surveillance studies reporting a rising trend . although candida albicans remains the most common fungal isolate from neonatal candidemia ,
meticulous attention to hand hygiene practices , use of sterile alcohol swabs , scrupulous care of medical devices , routine glove wearing even when urgent situation arise in nicus were the measures implemented .
isolated from the cases was diverse and since all the isolates were recovered over a short period of the time and exhibited nearly identical phenotypic characters , they were part of an outbreak that probably must have originated from a common source .
the other five cases occurred within a period of 10 days after the patients had been in nicu for 19 , 28 , 8 , 26 and 15 days respectively .
