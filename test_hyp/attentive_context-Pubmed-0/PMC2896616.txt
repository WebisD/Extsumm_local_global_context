a good transduction efficiency of polarized cellular monostrates with a last - generation lv vector pseudotyped with vsv - g was obtained , but only at high virus to cell ratios . given that no studies have tested directly the effect of lv vectors on the tight junction ( tj ) stability and organization in airway epithelial cells , we evaluated the transduction efficiency as well as acute cytotoxicity , transepithelial resistance ( ter ) , and occludin localization at the tj level in a bronchial - derived cell line grown in polarized fashion .
we find that the vsv - g - pseudotyped lv vector infection at high viral loads is cytotoxic and determines occludin loss from the apical plasmamembrane and reduction of ter . in order to rule out the toxic effect of lv particles
positively charged polycations such as polybrene are known to be required for efficient infection of cells with retroviruses and retrovirus vectors , possibly by stabilizing the interaction between negatively charged virus particles and target cellular membranes   .
pei / lv particles and free pei did not cause any alteration on ter and in occludin localization , indicating that pei - induced nanoscale holes in the plasma membrane do not affect tj integrity . in conclusion ,
