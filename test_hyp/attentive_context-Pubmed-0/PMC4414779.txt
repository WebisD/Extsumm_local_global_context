we describe the radiological findings of the paradoxical response of a cerebral tuberculoma mimicking a malignant brain tumor .
however the lesion revealed indistinguishable radiological findings of a malignant intracranial tumor such as a high grade glioma after anti - tb treatment .
brain tuberculoma could be aggravated mimicking brain malignancy during administration of anti - tb medication .
tuberculosis ( tb ) is common disease in developing and developed countries caused by various strains of mycobacteria , usually mycobacterium tuberculosis ( m. tuberculosis)14 ) .
this paradoxical response can be effectively managed by continuing the anti - tb drugs with careful radiologic follow - up .
she continued the anti - tb medication to treat the remaining lung and brain lesions .
these paradoxical responses are not uncommon in human immunodeficiency virus - negative patients and have been observed in 6 - 30% of patients with a tb infection6,7 ) .
these episodes of paradoxical deterioration are commonly associated with extrapulmonary tb and the central nervous system is the most common location for this presentation .
after 13 months of medication , the right hemiparesis improved and the lesion had decreased in size with decreased perilesional edema ( fig .
