the majority of the articles have confirmed that there is a correlation between pd and ra , since both disorders have characteristics in common and result from an imbalance in the immunoinflammatory response . although it is necessary to highlight the importance of the mechanical treatment for periodontitis and pharmacological treatments mainly for ra patients , more research is needed to assess whether the coexistence of both diseases can affect the clinical signs of periodontitis and systemic markers of rheumatoid arthritis and strengthen the capacity of oral bacteria to stimulate an autoimmune response , thus establishing that cell constituents or mediators could share common pathophysiological pathways for both diseases and therefore define the best therapy .
for this review , the us national library of medicine national institutes of health pubmed was searched by two independent researchers who agreed with the search criteria of studies with patients with both pd and ra and checked by a third researcher separately .
then , 26 articles were finally included for this review , which related to pd and ra , considering epidemiological aspects , mechanical periodontal treatment , mediators of inflammation , oral microbiota , and antibodies as seen in figure 2 .
