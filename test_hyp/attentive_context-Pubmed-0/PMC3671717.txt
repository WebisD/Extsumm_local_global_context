the purpose of this study is to evaluate , by comparing , the existing correlation between preoperative radiological classification of endolaryngeal tumors involving the anterior commissure ( endoscopy , ct scan ) and postoperative classification ( pt pathology ) .
squamous - cell carcinoma represented the main pathology ( 124 patients ) with a case of adenosquamous carcinoma , a case of pseudosarcomatous carcinoma , and a last case of verrucous carcinoma .
this is a single - center retrospective study ( 19982005 ) conducted at the croix - rousse hospital on 127 patients with endolarynx cancer involving the anterior commissure .
the tumor is classified ct4a , and the patient is amenable to an aggressive therapy given the high risk of local recurrence and low radiosensitivity .
laryngeal cancers represent about 30% of head and neck cancers with a high incidence for the glottic location ( from 25 to 85% )   .  
our study shows that radiological pretreatment classification ( ct ) of laryngeal cancer involving the anterior commissure is often inaccurate when compared with postoperative pathology ( pt ) .
now the evaluation of the cartilaginous extension , especially thyroid , is an important element in the pre - therapeutic assessment of the endolaryngeal cancer . in case of infiltration
