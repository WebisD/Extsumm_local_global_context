strikingly , the phenotypes of wg and dwnt4 misexpression were similar to non - autonomous polarity defects associated with fz clones ( surrounding wild - type cells orienting towards mutant area ) and opposite to fz gof defects ( wild - type cells orienting away from fz - overexpression regions ) . to establish that these gof phenotypes are mediated by fz / pcp signaling , and not by potential effects of the canonical wnt/-catenin pathway , we induced wnt4-expressing clones in fz null mutant wings ( the entire animal lacks fz , but can signal canonically via the dfz2 receptor ) .
d ) indicate that the wnt gof pcp phenotypes are mediated through fz / pcp - signaling and that fz acts downstream of wnts in this context .
as the extra - cellular domain of fz , mainly the wnt binding crd , is necessary and sufficient for the non - autonomous function of fz , we revisited these issues and asked systematically , whether and how wnts might function in drosophila pcp generation .
strikingly , such a scenario would suggest that wg regulates pcp directionality through both pcp systems , affecting fz / pcp interactions directly ( this study ) and through canonical wg - signaling transcriptionally regulating graded fj and ds expression in eyes and wings . in summary ,
