the conference was divided in two sections : a gathering of experiences , of paths where science meets metaphysics to have a new language born , made of images and movement , and a panel to understand how taiji quan , the arts of movement and meditation , can prolifically meet cognitive sciences and neurosciences .
modern science , which paved the way for an outlook of reality considering the universe as a whole , in which all parts and phenomena are connected among them , can be integrated to the ancient eastern wisdom for the control of the mind and to the body arts ( taiji quan , qi gong , yoga ) to develop a new ecological awareness , an awareness based on nature and on the dynamic relation among all living creatures .
goodwill of the conference is to act as a starting point to develop a net of experts , doctors and scientists , who will investigate the dynamic interactions between spiritual insight and scientific analysis to come to the creation of a new paradigm of modern science .
science , philosophy , medicine and body arts of the ancient east are reunited together to create a new ecological awareness of body and mind .
