the dentigerous cyst is a common non - inflammatory odontogenic cyst of the oral cavity .
we report an unusual histopathological variant of the dentigerous cyst , the keratinizing dentigerous cyst , which has been reported only once previously in literature .
treatment involves surgical enucleation or marsupialization with or without preservation of the impacted tooth , followed by histopathological evaluation to rule out an odontogenic keratocyst ( okc ) , ameloblastoma , or rarely , malignant transformation .
it 's pathogenesis involves the accumulation of fluid between the unerupted tooth crown and surrounding follicle , giving rise to the characteristic clinical and radiographic finding of a cystic lesion surrounding the neck of the tooth ( latin : dens , tooth + gerere , to bear ) .
the present case is about a 21-year - old male patient of indian origin reported with a complaint of mild pain and swelling in the lower front region of the jaw for the past 1 year .
long term follow - up of patients presenting with a keratinizing dentigerous cyst is advised to observe its potential for recurrence or malignant transformation since very little is known about this unusual entity .
we report a case of keratinizing dentigerous cyst which , to the best of our knowledge , has been reported only once previously in the literature .
