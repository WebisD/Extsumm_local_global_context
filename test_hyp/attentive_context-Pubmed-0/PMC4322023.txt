, we examined bone mass in a trabecular abundant site of lumbar spine and ca balance such as intestinal ca absorption and ca accumulation in ovx rats after 8 weeks of dhea administration .
seventeen female sprague - dawley rats , 6 weeks old , were surgically ovariectomized and randomized into two groups : ovx control rats ( oc , n = 8) and ovx rats with dhea treatment ( od , n = 9 ) .
the present study confirmed the positive effect of dhea on trabecular bone mass of lumbar spine in ovariectomized rats . on the other hand , dhea administration did not affect intestinal ca absorption .
we suggest that dhea administration might have limited impact on intestinal ca absorption in estrogen deficiency state .
the intestinal ca absorption , rate of intestinal ca absorption , ca accumulation , and rate of ca accumulation decreased from mc 1 ( the 4th and 5th of the experimental diet period ) to mc 2 ( the end of the experimental period ) , but the interaction of time and group was not observed . in both mc1 and mc2 , all parameters did not differ between the groups .
