, we review the specific characteristics of histone h3.3 , the spectrum of mutations identified in tumors , and recent work directed at understanding how mutation of this protein contributes to disease .
2013 ) , diseases of adolescents and young adults . the majority of the mutations have been identified in genes encoding histone h3.3 , which serves as a replacement histone as its deposition is not coupled to dna synthesis . here
we anticipate that the development of additional model systems to interrogate the function of mutant h3 proteins together with insight from analysis of tumors will fuel the collaborative synergy between experts in cancer biology , chromatin biologists , and chemical biologists to develop effective therapies for patients and to improve our understanding of the fascinating biology of histone h3 .
chromatin is critical for the regulation of genome stability and for transcriptional control and its importance in disease has been highlighted by the frequent identification of mutations in chromatin - modifying enzymes in cancer genomes ( plass et al .
much progress has been made in our understanding of these histone mutants since their discovery , but there remains much to be done to develop therapies for pediatric hgg and for the skeletal and bone tumors .
