the aim of our study was to identify the underlying genetic cause of disease in a cohort of 64 sls cases  selected on the basis of msi , loss of mmr , young onset and often a family history for ls  by screening the mmr , pole and pold1 genes in both leukocyte and tumor dna .
our results further emphasize the importance of pole / pold1 germline and somatic screening in unexplained msi - h and mmr - deficient tumors .
inactivation of the mismatch repair ( mmr ) genes mlh1 , msh2 , msh6 and pms2 causes lynch syndrome ( ls ) , an autosomal dominant predisposition for colorectal and endometrial cancer .
the exact role of somatic pole / pold1 variants in tumors with high microsatellite instability ( msi - h ) remains unclear .
the number of variants detected in the sequenced area in the present study implicates an ultramutated phenotype , with > 100 variants / mb in all pole / pold1-edm mutated tumors in this cohort . as only a limited region ( 31  kb )
all three variants are missense , but are predicted to affect function ( supplementary table 2 ) . as these variants are not found in ultramutated tumors , evidence of deleterious functional effect is lacking . in conclusion , targeted next - generation sequencing of 62 sls cases led to the detection of 9 highly mutated tumors with a germline ( n=2 ) or somatic ( n=7 ) pole / pold1-edm variant . even though pole germline variants have previously been shown to co - occur with somatic mmr variants , in this study we found germline and somatic pole / pold1 variants in a cohort selected for sls characteristics .
