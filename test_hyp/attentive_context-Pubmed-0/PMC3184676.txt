r - test ecg monitoring for a period of 7 days , with the possibility of repeating the test , could be a preliminary test to determine the use of the implantable loop recorder in patients with unexplained syncope .
2 ) , five patients with supra - ventricular ectopic beats , four patients with short traits of parossistic supra - ventricular tachycardia and three patients with short traits of atrial fibrillation ) ( figs .
the issue-2 study with the early application of a loop recorder in patients with unexplained syncope demonstrated that in a minority of patients during syncope recurrences there are tachy or bradyarrhythmias , supraventricular or ventricular that are responsible for syncopal episodes . in our study , the r - test was able to detect an arrhythmic cause of syncope in some patients with negative hutt and negative traditional holter ecg monitoring . in our opinion ,
of the 45 patients who underwent the r - test , five patients were symptomatic for syncope : in three cases there was a registration of complete atrial ventricular block with idio - ventricular rhythm and in two cases there was evidence of major pauses > 3 sec ( fig .
