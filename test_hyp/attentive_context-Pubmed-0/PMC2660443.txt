patients were seen in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. symptoms of hypogonadism were assessed by completion of the androgen deficiency in the aging male ( adam ) questionnaire , which was validated to assess hypogonadism in aging men ( 19 ) .
mean sex hormone levels , measures of obesity , and cholesterol levels in men treated with any statin , atorvastatin , and simvastatin compared with untreated men p values given for student 's t test comparing treated patients with the untreated group .
researchers should also investigate mechanisms that lead to changes in shbg and total testosterone in this context .
the opportunity to conduct similar studies of men with type 2 diabetes , comparing men treated with statins to untreated men , has now probably passed owing to the almost ubiquitous use of statins in this group
average testosterone , shbg , and measures of obesity in men treated with atorvastatin split into two groups : those treated with 10 mg and those treated with 20 mg or more the 10-mg atorvastatin group was compared with the no statin group with student 's t test ; significant results are shown in boldface .
this is the first study to analyze fully testosterone levels and hypogonadal symptoms in comparison with statin use in a population receiving routine medical management .
