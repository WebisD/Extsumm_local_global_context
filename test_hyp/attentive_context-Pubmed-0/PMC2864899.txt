the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of ftld - fus in our ftld - u cases and to describe the clinical , neuroimaging and neuropathological features of ftld - fus .
we estimated a frequency of ftld - fus of three percent in the total series of patients with clinical ftd , based on the clinical variables age at onset , family history , and clinical subtype .
all four ftld - fus cases presented with severe behavioural changes , young age at onset , negative family history , and caudate atrophy on mri .
this study showed a frequency of ftld - fus of six percent of all our pathologically proven ftld cases , and 11 percent of the ftld - u cases .
age at onset 40  years , negative family history , bvftd and caudate atrophy on mri could be useful clinical predictors of ftld - fus as an underlying pathology in patients with clinical ftd .
ftld - fus cases were pathologically characterized by striking atrophy of the caudate nucleus , ubiquitin and fus - positive , p62 and tdp-43-negative nii with remarkable morphology .
frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( ftld ) is the common underlying pathology of all four clinical variants , and can be divided into ftld with tau - positive immunoreactive inclusions ( ftld - tau ) and ftld with ubiquitin - positive immunoreactive inclusions ( ftld - u ) . after the tdp-43 protein
