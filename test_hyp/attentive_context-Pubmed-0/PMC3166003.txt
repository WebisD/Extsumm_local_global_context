these results call into question the current classification of eblv-1 into 2 single subtypes . to provide a better understanding of eblv-1 molecular epidemiology in europe ,
all phylogenetic analyses , regardless of the reconstruction criterion used , formed a monophyletic cluster of the eblv-1 strains from spain ( only the bayesian inference reconstruction is shown ) .
the bayesian inference , maximum - likelihood , and maximum - parsimony analyses identified the cluster from spain and eblv-1a and eblv-1b as being monophyletic ( figure 1 ) , although only maximum - likelihood and maximum - parsimony analyses suggested a closer relationship between eblv-1a and the cluster from spain .
the genetic differentiation of the eblv-1 strains from the iberian peninsula matches their association with another bat species ( figure 2 ) , which suggests that the host bat s evolutionary history plays a major role in eblv-1 molecular epidemiology , as has been proposed for rabies virus in bats in north america ( 14 ) .
duvv , duvenhage virus . the genetic structure and relationships between haplotypes were examined within the main lineages through a parsimony - based network built with a median - joining algorithm implemented in the network 4.5.1 program ( 11 ) . to evaluate and compare genetic variability and polymorphism among lineages
