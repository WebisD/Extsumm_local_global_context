we report one such rare case of tongue neoplasm which turned out to be acc in a middle aged lady .
the adenoid cystic carcinoma ( acc ) is a relatively rare epithelial tumor of the salivary glands .
a 45-year - old - female patient presented with an asymptomatic growth of the tongue , which was perceived just 2 weeks before consultation .
the frequency reported in the tongue is 19.8% , with 85% observed at the base of the tongue .
it accounts for about 5 - 10% of all salivary gland neoplasms , representing 2 - 4% of malignant occurrences of the head and neck area .
approximately , 31% of lesions affect minor salivary glands , particularly the palate , although they can also be observed in the sub - mandibular and parotid glands .
minor salivary gland neoplasms occur less commonly than the major salivary gland tumors and tongue is a relatively uncommon site for salivary gland neoplasms
however , due to local recurrence and late metastasis , surgery remains the mainstay of management with or without radiotherapy .
the most common intra - oral site for minor salivary gland tumors is the hard palate , followed by the base of the tongue where up to 96% of all tumors are malignant , and acc represents 30% of them . on the other hand ,
