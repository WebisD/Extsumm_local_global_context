the present study investigated outcomes in japanese patients with favorable - risk mrcc according to the memorial sloan kettering cancer center ( mskcc ) criteria who had been treated with ifn or tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( tki ) therapy as a first - line systemic therapy .
ifn is associated with a survival benefit in japanese patients with favorable - risk metastatic rcc in the era of targeted therapy .
the cr rate was higher in the ifn group than in the tki group , and the objective response rate ( orr ) and clinical benefit were higher in the tki group than in the ifn group , but these differences did not reach the level of statistical significance ( p=0.649 , p=0.212 and p=0.122 , respectively ) .
three patients ( 10% ) in the ifn group and two patients ( 12% ) in the tki group suffered from toxicities and could not continue ifn . because they could not continue their primary systemic treatment ,
food and drug administration and european medicines agency have approved novel agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathways for patients with metastatic rcc ( mrcc ) on the basis of the results of large randomized clinical trials . single - agent interferon ( ifn )
