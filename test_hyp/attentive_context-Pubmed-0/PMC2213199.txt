toll - like receptor ( tlr ) agonists such as endotoxins initiate the synthesis of the inactive il-1 precursor ( fig .
steps in the processing and secretion of il-1. ( a ) tlr ligands such as endotoxin trigger gene expression and synthesis of the il-1 precursor , which remains diffusely in the cytosol . in the same cell , inactive procaspase-1
dysregulation in any of these steps might account for increased secretion of il-1 and for il-1mediated diseases .
sojia ( also known as systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ) is a devastating , systemic inflammatory disease that affects growing children for which there are few treatment options other than high dose corticosteroid treatment . in this issue ,
neutralization of tnf , a successful treatment in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis , is now discredited in sojia since the tnf inhibitors etanercept and infliximab are associated with treatment failures , worsening of disease and/or exacerbations of other autoimmune diseases in these patients .
the rapid resolution of clinical , hematological , and biochemical manifestations of sojia after a few days of il-1ra treatment is reminiscent of the treatment of refractory adult onset still 's disease , a systemic inflammatory disease of adults characterized by similar manifestations of disease seen in sojia .
