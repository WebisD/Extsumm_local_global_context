taking together these limitations may lead to the loss of the significant differences of the patients with mechanical prosthesis comparing with recipients of biological prosthesis and healthy volunteers .
current study contains the following limitations : the number of examined patients with implanted mechanical prostheses was low ( 7 persons ) ; duration of prosthesis functioning was significantly shorter in this group compared to patients with biological heart valve prostheses .
however , dynamic changes of their quantities in systemic blood flow , participation in pathogenesis of responses against foreign materials , and potential diagnostic importance were poorly investigated . in connection with this , our study was aimed at assessing t cell subsets of peripheral blood from recipients of long - term functioning biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses .
parameters of hemogram ( wbc total , count of neutrophils , lymphocytes , and monocytes ) were shown to lack differences between patients with biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses as well as healthy volunteers ( table 2 ) . while examining t cell arm of immunity it was found that recipients with biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses did not differ in terms of both relative and absolute counts of all examined t cell subsets . at the same time , these parameters were shown to differ when compared with healthy volunteers ( table 3 ) .
