eus - td with sems placement for infected pp , pancreatic abscess or wons is a technically feasible and apparently safe alternative to ctd and td .
peripancreatic fluid collections ( pfcs ) can develop secondary to either fluid leakage or liquefaction of pancreatic necrosis following acute pancreatitis , chronic pancreatitis , surgery , or abdominal trauma.14 previously focusing on the original atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis,5 pfcs include acute fluid collections , acute and chronic pancreatic pseudocysts , pancreatic abscesses , and pancreatic necrosis .
more recently , the use of covered self - expandable metallic stents ( csemss ) has provided a safer and more efficient approach route for internal drainage . in this review , we focus on the best approach and stent to use in endoscopic drainage for pfcs on the basis of the original atlanta classification5 because of lack of clinical results confirming the revised atlanta classification.6
 however , since this finding is extremely uncommon , the term  pancreatic abscess  was confusing even investigators of pancreatic diseases . in 2013 , the revised atlanta classification proposed to clarify several issues from the original atlanta classification.6 the revised atlanta classification classified local complications mostly followed by acute pancreatitis into four types according to pathological conditions and timing as follows : 1 ) acute peripancreatic fluid collection ( apfc ) ; 2 ) acute necrotic collection ( anc ) ( sterile or infected ) ; 3 ) pancreatic pseudocyst ( pp ) ; and 4 ) walled - off necrosis ( won ) ( sterile or infected),6 in this classification , the term  pancreatic abscess  was removed and divided into infected pps and wons based on their component and radiologic images.6 until 2013 , an infected pp was lumped together with an infected won in the same category as a pancreatic abscess .
