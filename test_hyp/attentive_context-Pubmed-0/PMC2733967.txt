if wt1 mutation is documented , karyotyping and serial abdominal ultrasonographies are warranted for the evaluation of tumor development in the gonad and kidney , and the analysis of genotype - phenotype correlations should be continued .
, we present two cases of idms with different wt1 gene mutations that had previously been reported in association with dds .
the first patient is well on peritoneal dialysis with no sign of malignancy on three - monthly screening and we are considering of nephrectomy at the time of transplantation .
however , analysis of a large number of patients might provide clues to the role of each mutation , and might help in understanding the normal physiology of nephrogenesis and the prediction for tumorigenesis . in this report
the nephropathies in dds are characterized by the histological finding of diffuse mesangial sclerosis ( dms ) , a finding also described in some cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome ( isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis , idms ) .
the mutation present in the second patient was previously reported in a dds patient with early onset esrf resulting from dms , ambiguous genitalia , and a 46 xy karyotype .
wt1 has been shown to play a role in kidney induction ( 2 ) and during later steps of nephrogenesis ( 3 ) , and there are suggestions that wt1 may play an important role in the maintenance of normal podocyte function ( 4 ) . besides wilms ' tumor , a number of human diseases have been shown to be associated with mutations of the wt1 gene ( 5 ) .
