imt was positively and significantly associated with age ( r = 0.265 , p < 0.05 ) , waist circumference ( r = 0.263 , p < 0.05 ) , body mass index ( r = 0.285 , p < 0.05 ) , systolic blood pressure ( r = 0.276 , p < 0.05 ) , uaer ( r = 0.359 , p < 0.05 ) , hba1c ( r = 0.462 , p < 0.05 ) , and duration of diabetes ( r = 0.370 , p < 0.05 ) . in multiple stepwise regression analyses , age , body mass index , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , waist and hip circumference , uaer , fbg , plasma hba1c concentration , serum concentrations of triglycerides and total , hdl and ldl cholesterol , current smoking , and duration of diabetes mellitus were included in the model as independent variables .
therefore , in this study we sought to clarify the relationship between microalbuminuria and markers of carotid atherosclerosis including imt and plaque in type 2 diabetic patients .
patients of the microalbuminuria group with elevated uaer had higher fbg , bmi , waist and hip circumference , triglycerides , hba1c , and imt than those of the normoalbuminuria group with normal uaer ( p < 0.05 for all ; table 1 , figure 1 ) . the plaque incidence rate and plaque type rate ( soft , dense , and calcified plaques ) between two groups were shown in table 2 .
