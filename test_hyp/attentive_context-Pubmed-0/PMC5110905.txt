we present a case involving the transnasal intracranial penetration of a wooden branch that resulted in a delayed intracranial infection due to initial misdiagnosis .
a 48-year - old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of headache the day before .
the present case illustrates the necessity for special attention to patients suspected of having pneumocephalus with a rare presentation during the initial examination . early surgical removal of the intracranial foreign body is necessary to prevent complications .
brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed a fistula from the left nasal cavity to the frontal lobe with enhancement along the tract and ventricular lining ( figure 4 ) .
when intracranial penetrations of wooden objects occur through the transnasal or transorbital route , physical examinations may reveal no abnormalities , and the objects may be difficult to visualize with conventional radiography .
intracranial foreign bodies frequently result from trauma , including penetrating injury , and rarely involve wooden materials compared with metallic materials .
once the diagnosis of an intracranial foreign body is confirmed , surgical removal of the foreign body is required .
computed tomography ( ct ) that was performed upon admission showed a round hypodense signal in the left frontal area , which suggested pneumocephalus , and a small amount acute subdural hematoma in the left frontotemporoparietal area ( figure 2 and 3 ) .
