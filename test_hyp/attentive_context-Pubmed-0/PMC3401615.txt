the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms ( pcns ) is around 2.5%.1,2 pancreatic cysts are increasingly discovered probably because of the ubiquitous presence of multi - detector computed tomography ( ct ) scans and their increased use to evaluate patients with abdominal complaints .
eus with fine needle aspiration ( fna ) along with cyst fluid analysis has been advocated to improve the utility of eus in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts .
size > 3 cm and/or the presence of mural nodules appear to be the best indicators of malignant change in patients with the side branch form of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( sb - ipmn ) and mucinous cystic neoplasms ( mcn).3 eus with cyst fluid aspiration and/or fna can play a role in differentiating pcns .
endoscopic ultrasound ( eus ) plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of patients with pancreatic cysts but eus and cross - sectional imaging alone have proven to be inaccurate in identifying the exact nature of the cysts .
there is inadequate information on the natural history of pancreatic cysts but our knowledge base can not be expanded without being able to determine the exact nature of the cyst noninvasively . toward this end ,
