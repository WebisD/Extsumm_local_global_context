we present a case of volvulus of terminal ileum which was diagnosed and treated surgically in a neonate just 15 h after delivery .
this is the first report of intrauterine volvulus of terminal ileum without malrotation that was diagnosed by ultrasound .
based on our case , we suggest : in any case of suspected intestinal obstruction , first we have to rule out intestinal malrotation with an upper gastrointestinal barium study .
some other causes can be due to postoperative adhesions , duplication cyst , meconium  ileus  , and internal hernia . according to our knowledge ,
once malrotation is ruled out , we suggest immediately performing an ultrasound examination of the abdomen to rule out an ileal volvulus .
therefore , it is of medical importance to recognize the radiological signs of bowel torsion as soon as possible .
thus , ultrasound examination that shows a target lesion  bird beak  sign of the involved bowel allows to quickly identify this morbid entity without loss of precious time .
our case deals with terminal ileum torsion around its axis with twisting of mesenteric vessels .
the most common causes of these cases of intestinal obstruction are intestinal atresia that is fatal in the first hours of life if not treated immediately .
