in myelodysplastic syndrome , interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5 is a common cytogenetical abnormality seen in 16 - 28% of the patients .
a 78-year - old woman presented with weakness , fatigue and hemoglobin of 8.3 g / dl , to another clinic in september , 2009 , and she was given erythrocyte suspension replacement .
less often adverse events of fatigue , rash and diarrhea can be noted . in conclusion , in isolated 5q - syndrome which is a mds subgroup and characterized by transfusion dependency ; lenalidomide can decrease transfusion dependency with a tolerable adverse event profile that can be overcome with dose modifications .
assessment of all prevalent cases in our country will be helpful to reveal the efficacy and adverse event profile of lenalidomide .
one of the major problems during the progression of the disease in transfusion - dependent mds patients is the iron overload secondary to transfusion and the dependency for chelation therapy to treat iron overload .
this syndrome is rarely seen ; therefore , there is not enough data about isolated 5q - syndrome as well as lenalidomide therapy in our country .
she had been lost - to - follow up for approximately a year and during that time she had received a total of 4 units of erythrocyte suspension , and erythropoietin treatment was started .
