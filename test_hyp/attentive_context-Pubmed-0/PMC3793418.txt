hence , the aim of our study was an evaluation of the periodontal parameters ; pd , and al , on the distobuccal aspect of the second molar after surgical extraction of the impacted third molar .
further studies using reconstructive procedures are recommended for preventing or resolving persistent periodontal defects on the distal aspect of the second molar after surgical removal of the impacted mandibular third molar .
we concluded that the extraction of deeply impacted third molars causes increased pd at the distal aspect of the second molars , but al decreased .
pre - operative panoramic view of a class c impacted mandibular third molar ( a ) , post - operative panoramic view of the same tooth ( b ) periodontal pd was measured on the distobuccal aspect of adjacent second molars with using a customized occlusal stent as a guide for the path of insertion of periodontal probe and michigan o periodontal probe ( hu - friedy , chicago , il ) before surgery ( pd1 ) and 6 months after surgery ( pd2 ) .
the results of this study showed that routine surgical management of full impacted mesioangular third molars resulted in statistically significant increased pd on the distal aspect of the mandibular second molars and the decrease in al were also statistically significant 6 months after surgery .
