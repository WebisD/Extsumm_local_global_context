this is shown by the reduced incorporation of brdu into replicating dna of hepg2 cells and an increase in the number of dna damageinducing and apoptotic proteins , bax and caspase3 in hepg2 cells treated with c. vulgaris .
, we investigated the anticancer effect of c. vulgaris extract on the hepatoma cell line hepg2 by evaluating changes in proliferation , dna damage and apoptosis .
the results of the present study suggest that the anticancer mechanism of c. vulgaris in hepatoma cells ( hepg2 ) is by inhibiting dna synthesis , triggering dna damage and inducing apoptosis .
our results showed that c. vulgaris mediated apoptosis in a p53dependent manner with increased expression of bax and decreased expression of bcl2 proteins in a timedependent manner .
al showed that a glycoprotein , designated ars2 , found in c. vulgaris extract has an anticancer effect on miceinduced fibrosarcoma.22   to the best of our knowledge , the effect of c. vulgaris on hepatoma cells has not been studied in great detail . in this study
2).24   the percentange of apoptosis of hepg2 and wrl68 cells as induced by c. vulgaris extract at 2mg / ml is demonstrated in figure 3 ; the rate of apoptosis was significantly higher ( 70% ) in hepg2 cells compared to normal wrl68 cells ( 15% ) .
