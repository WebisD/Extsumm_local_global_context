we feel this case is extraordinary because of the patient s development of calciphylaxis in spite of her relatively mild stage of ckd , as well as clinical response to specific therapy targeted at the pathophysiology of both primary and shpt as detailed . based on our experience in conjunction with
that reported by others , we feel that administration of calcimimetics should be considered as an important adjunct in the treatment of calciphylaxis .
, this case represents the first reported case of an individual with stage 3 ckd who developed calciphylaxis amidst mixed hyperparathyroidism ( both primary and secondary ) and was successfully treated with subtotal parathyroidectomy ( for pathologically confirmed parathyroid adenoma ) followed by cinacalcet ( for background shpt ) .
a 66-year - old caucasian woman with a medical history significant for chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) stage 3 , hypertension , and morbid obesity was followed regularly at our nephrology and hypertension clinic .
calciphylaxis ( often referred to as calcific uremic arteriolopathy ) is a disabling , and potentially life - threatening complication that has been reported to affect as many as 4% of patients with end - stage renal disease.3 it has been observed to occur primarily in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis .
