the present study builds on previous work   and utilized difference gel eletrophoresis ( dige ) coupled with mass spectrometry ( ms ) to exploit recently gathered rw1 genome data . when used together , these tools yield information on the response of cells of s. wittichii rw1 to dioxin exposure and the bacterium 's degradative activity toward this recalcitrant compound .
the aim of this study was to investigate system - wide changes in protein expression during growth on dibenzofuran , a nontoxic surrogate for dibenzo - p - dioxin , as compared to nonselective growth media .
this study highlights a number of proteins that were changed in response to dibenzofuran exposure , opens the door to a greater understanding of how s. wittichii rw1 performs and regulates the degradation of dioxins , and suggests ways to enhance the biodegradation of dioxins .
of the 7 identified proteins increased during growth on dibenzofuran , 2 were directly related to the dibenzofuran degradation pathway ( figure 4 ) ; the others were involved in downstream metabolic processes ( catechol 1,2-dioxygenase , adenosylhomocysteinase ) , cell growth ( elongation factor ts ) , and cell protection ( cold shock dna - binding domain protein , alkyl hydroperoxide reductase ) .
