a 3-year - old girl was admitted to our hospital with unexplained fever and paroxysmal abdominal pain that had persisted for three days .
pentastomiasis infections should be considered in the diagnoses of patients with a history of such abdominal symptoms and who have consumed snake meat , though the definite diagnosis depends on the pathology report .
the patient made an uneventful recovery after a half a month of therapy and she was discharged from our hospital .
we report here a case where the patient had a history of eating snake meat several months prior to her hospital admission , and her main symptoms were a high fever and abdominal pain .
the imaging features of the abdominal mri revealed marked hepatomegaly with diffuse homogeneous nodular lesions throughout the hepatic parenchyma , diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and disseminated miliary nodules on the peritoneum .
the chest ct showed scattered small nodules in both lungs . when liver enlargement and hepatic disseminated miliary nodules are identified , it is necessary to differentiate pentastomiasis hepatic involvement from other diseases .
, we have presented a rare case of pentastomiasis infection that involved many organs , including the liver , small intestine , peritoneum , lung and retroperitoneal lymph nodes .
