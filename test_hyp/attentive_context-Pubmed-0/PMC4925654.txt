the position of the mnf has been studied for mandibular treatment ( i.e. ramal surgery , including osteotomy ; inferior alveolar nerve block).56 the present study used 3d images of the mandibles of patients diagnosed with skeletal class iii malocclusion , and analyzed the position of the mnf ( i.e. its proportional position in the mandible ) using measurement planes and anatomical reference points .
furthermore , the methods used here and the positional 3d analyses of the mnf can be used clinically for computer - assisted surgical methods , especially for ramal surgery in patients with skeletal class iii mandibular prognathism .
the purpose of this study was to produce a useful guide of mnf positions in patients diagnosed with skeletal class iii malocclusion .
three - dimensional ( 3d ) image analysis of the mandible is possible due to the wide availability of computed tomography ( ct ) imaging technology .
the present study showed that the proportional position of the mnf was significantly related to the vertical heights of the sigmoid notch , coronoid process , and condyle and to the horizontal anteroposterior length of the ascending ramus .
we expect that future studies will contribute further knowledge about the position of the mnf in the mandible via 3d image analysis of mandibles with skeletal class ii malocclusion for ramus surgery . in conclusion , the 3d mandibular image analysis data reported in this study will be useful for defining and describing the position of the mnf in mandibles of different sizes and shapes and in different ethnic groups .
