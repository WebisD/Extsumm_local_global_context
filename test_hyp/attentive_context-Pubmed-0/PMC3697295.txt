therefore , our study was aimed to determine is levels and three different types of antioxidant enzyme activities gsh - px , gr , and sod , in t2d with ati and li .
in this study , we directly measured the is level , together with three different types of antioxidant enzyme activities , gsh - px , sod , and gr , in t2d patients and nondiabetic individuals with two different subtypes of ischemic stroke in type 2 diabetics .
in conclusion , our results suggest that the presence of different subtypes of ischemic stroke is associated with insulin resistance and diminished antioxidant enzyme activity in both subtypes of ischemic stroke in t2d .
mu / l , respectively , p < 0.001 ) and in nondiabetics with ati ( group d ) or li ( group e ) in comparison to healthy controls ( group f ) ( 15.57  1.86 and 15.59  1.26 versus 7.54  2.03 
in this study we included a total of 93 patients with t2d , ascribed to the following groups : t2d patients with ati ( group a , n = 30 ) , and t2d with li ( group b , n = 30 ) , and t2d without ischemic stroke ( group c , n = 33 ) .
