this study will test two hypotheses about the use of f - fdg pet - ct in differentiation of stss and bfs .
we found statistically significant differences in the suvmax of stss ( 10.7 , range : 2.0 - 33.7 ) and bfs ( 2.8 , range : 1.1 - 12.3 ) .
however , given the importance of making a prospective diagnosis of a sarcoma , the high sensitivity affirms the value of f - fdg pet - ct in the early diagnostic workup of patients suspected of having a primary or recurrent sarcoma , especially given that the studies were interpreted in the absence of historical and clinical data .
61 ) and varied among the different sps , being highest for the thin sp (  = 0.70 ) and lowest for the thick sp (  = 0.46 , table 4 )
we hypothesized that 1 ) f - fdg pet - ct can differentiate stss from bfs , and 2 ) sp can provide useful information in differentiating stss from bfs in addition to that provided by suvmax .
the median suvmax for all lesions was 5.5 ( range : 1.1 - 33.7 ) .
the median suvmax of abscesses ( 11.6 , range 4.3 -12.3 ) was higher than that of the other bfs ( 2.7 , range 1.1 - 8.4 ) ( p=0.009 ) .
