, this analysis suggests that the use of dabigatran as a first - line treatment for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is likely to be cost - effective in eligible uk patients with atrial fibrillation compared with well controlled warfarin , and 
key parameters that affected the cost - effectiveness were the degree of inr control attained by patients on warfarin , the rr and overall rates of is , ich and hs for dabigatran versus warfarin , the cost of long - term follow - up care for patients with disability , and time horizon analysed ( figure 2 ) .
the present study used an economic model to systematically assess the costs and consequences of dabigatran treatment used per its european indication , in which the 150  mg dose is recommended for patients under age 80 and the 110  mg dose for those aged 80 and over .
the analyses compare dabigatran with warfarin ( with trial - like inr control ) , aspirin and no treatment .
compared with warfarin , patients treated sequentially over their remaining lifetime with dabigatran experienced fewer total ich and hs ( 0.43 vs 0.99 ) and is ( 3.74 vs 3.97 ) events per 100 patient - years , but more ech ( 3.88 vs 3.57 ) and ami ( 1.27 vs 1.06 ) events per 100 patient - years .
