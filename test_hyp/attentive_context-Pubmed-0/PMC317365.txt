composed of the short form 36 item health survey ( short form-36 or sf-36 )   and 18 disease specific items , this 54-item self - report measure combines the strength of generic and disease specific approaches to hrqol measurement . by complementing the sf-36 with questions focusing on the specific domains affected by ms it becomes possible to compare the hrqol of a patient suffering from ms with the hrqol of the general population and the hrqol of patients with other diseases . in routine clinical practice the instrument could be used to evaluate the differences in hrqol of individuals at various stages of ms .
