hence , the present study is undertaken to isolate , identify and quantitate bacteria and to perform the antibiotic susceptibility testing from the endotracheal aspirates of the clinically suspected patients of vap .
chest x - ray finding in relation to the organism isolated of 53 patients diagnosed as vap based on a cpis score of more than six , 51 ( 96.23 % ) patients had monomicrobial infection and 2 ( 3.77% ) had polymicrobial infection . among the 27 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii , 1 ( 3.70% ) was resistant to all group of antibiotics tested in the study , including carbapenems .
different enzymes produced by the isolated strains in the present study it was found that the mortality rate was 45.28%.rate of mortality was less in early - onset vap ( 23.80% ) as compared to late onset vap group ( 59.37% ) and the difference was found to be statistically significant ( x1=6.473 ; df=1 ; p=0.011 ) .
the co - existence of ampc and mbl was reported in 9 ( 33.33% ) isolates of acinetobacter baumannii and 2 ( 11.76% ) isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa [ figure 2 ] .
all the 27 ( 100% ) isolates of acinetobacter baumannii were multidrug resistant ( mdr ) i.e. resistant to three or more class of antibiotics .
