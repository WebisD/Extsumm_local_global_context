given the differing clinical presentation , pathological characteristics , and heightened mortality rates of elderly melanoma patients , we aimed to compare disease characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients 70 years of age and older versus under 70 years old .
in our cohort of patients undergoing sln biopsy , melanoma in the elderly was more common on the head and neck , less likely to arise from a pre - existing nevus , had greater mean tumor thickness and more mitotic figures than melanoma in their younger counterparts .
the elderly patients had a higher rate of recurrence ( including local / in - transit , regional , or systemic recurrence ) relative to the younger patients ( 25.2% vs 9.1% 5 years after surgery ; hazard ratio [ hr]=2.6 , p<0.001 ; figure 1a ) .
5-year mortality rate from all causes was greater in the elderly group , 29.8% vs. 12.3% 5 years after surgery ( hr=3.0 , p<0.001 ; figure 2a ) . additionally , 5-year disease - specific mortality was higher for those 70 years old : 16.1% vs. 8.2% ( hr=2.3 , p=0.004 ; figure 2b ) . in a multivariate model of melanoma - specific survival
