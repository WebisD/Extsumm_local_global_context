to evaluate the healing potential in mandibular bone defects , either with no restoration ( negative control ) or with autologous bone graft restoration ( clinical standard ) , notch defects 6 cm in volume were created bilaterally in five dentally - mature sinclair miniature pigs ( > 1 year of age ) .
however , the presence of significant bone within the defect site after 16 weeks in the untreated defect precludes the use of this model as a csd for bone graft evaluation . in order to appropriately investigate bone graft materials
both experimental groups showed limited mineralized tissue within the defect site after 4 weeks , indicating that this model could be used to investigate therapies targeting accelerated bone regeneration at this early time point .
, future studies should include appropriate negative controls in their choice of bone defect in the pig mandible to ensure lack of a significant spontaneous regenerative response .
, studies can then move forward to test promising bone regenerative therapeutics in the cmf region and justify their translation for use in human clinical studies .
a. in the images of both the autograft - treated and untreated groups , significant bone growth was evident in the defect space .
