we demonstrate our approach by engineering multiple partzyme pairs incorporating various sequences derived by splitting catalytic domains from two different nucleic acid enzymes , known as the 1023 and 817 dnazymes.(12 ) while each partzyme is inherently inactive , when they are combined in the presence of an assembly facilitator , they may associate and form a catalytically active , multicomponent nucleic acid enzyme ( mnazyme ) .
mnazymes are a powerful class of enzyme that can be activated by the input of any specific synthetic or biological nucleic acid to produce an amplified output , which can be generic in nature .
this paper describes mnazymes , which are a powerful type of nucleic acid enzyme , with increased versatility and functionality that stems from the multiple components that make up these modular enzymes .
we describe a general approach for deriving partial catalytic core sequences from nucleic acid enzymes , which can then be incorporated into partial enzymes ( partzymes ) useful for assembly into mnazymes .
such oligonucleotides have been discovered by extensive re - engineering or in vitro evolution of ribozymes ( reviewed in refs ( 8 and 9 ) ) or by rational design utilizing specific tertiary structures within dnazymes such as guanine quartets(10 ) or stemloops.(11 ) for example , kolpashchikov(11 ) chose the e6 dnazyme for splitting because it contained a nonconserved stemloop that was thought to be required for structural , but not catalytic , function . in this report
