we investigated to evaluate whether biochemical response using serial plasma cga is reliable in concordance with the tumor response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) criteria in gep - nets irrespective of chemotherapeutic agents .
this study revealed that the changes of the plasma cga levels were associated with tumour response . additionally , biochemical response based on serial cga may be a predictive marker for pfs in gep - nets .
there was a significant difference for pfs between responders and non - responders ( 35.73 months vs. 5.93 months , p=0.05 ) based on the biochemical criteria ( fig .
the concordance of response between recist criteria and biochemical criteria were 74% ( table 3 ) . compared with the baseline values , a decrease of  50% in the cga level
previous studies [ 2 - 10,18 ] showed acceptable sensitivity ( 54%-78% ) and specificity ( 60%-86% ) for regression and sd ; jensen et al .   also reported that plasma cga concentration is important to disclose tumor progression with specificity and sensitivity , 86% and 86% , respectively . in our study , the concordance of response between recist criteria and biochemical criteria was 74% . compared with the baseline values , a decrease of  25% in the cga level was observed in four out of six patients ( 66.7% ) with pr based on recist criteria and an increased cga levels was shown in all 4 patients with pd ( 100% ) .
