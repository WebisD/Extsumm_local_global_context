the patient was a 77-year - old female patient admitted for surgery for the chief complaint of an intraductal carcinoma in the left breast that was diagnosed at another hospital .
in addition , in cases with anthracofibrosis findings detected accidentally during the endobronchial manipulation using a bronchoscope , it is highly probable that undiagnosed tuberculosis would be the cause .
in korea , where the incidence of tuberculosis is high , there is a strong likelihood of undiagnosed endobronchail anthracofibrosis in elderly women .
therefore , the cause of the anthracofibrosis in this patient was speculated to be an undiagnosed tuberculosis infection .
therefore , it is important to minimize airway stimulation . if continuous abnormal hemorrhage is detected after endotracheal suction , it is important to consider the possibility of massive hemorrhage within the bronchus caused by underlying anthracofibrosis .
huh and kang   reported a case of an 84-year - old male patient with undiagnosed endobronchial anthracofibrosis before surgery , who developed severe endobronchial hemorrhage after endotracheal suction by a routine method performed in the recovery room . in the recovery room ,
she was confirmed to have bronchial tuberculosis by the positivity for m tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction performed prior to surgery .
