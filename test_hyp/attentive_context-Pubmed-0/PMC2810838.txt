also discussed are higher level presentation methods for making use of the structureactivity information , which is contained in the fragmentation hierarchy . in the following section , methods will be described for generating a fragment tree , mapping sibling fragments onto each other in an optimal way , then using this mapping to guide the 2d depiction process .
a method has been demonstrated for treating scaffold - like fragmentation trees so that common ancestor fragments are depicted and oriented in a consistent way that makes common structural features readily evident to the observing chemist .
, a method will be described for obtaining 2d coordinates suitable for structure diagrams , which are chosen for both independent aesthetic appeal and for clearly showing the common substructure patterns by means of layout and orientation .
the value of presenting structural data in this way has been demonstrated , by using high - level and medium - level hierarchical tree views , which combine constrained clustering with activity color - coding , and the ability to examine individual structures that have a common depiction and orientation .
the algorithm operates without supervision and produces aesthetically desirable results using a combination of new and preexisting techniques . with the molecule layout and orientation method established , software applications that present fragmentation trees become significantly more valuable to medicinal chemists .
