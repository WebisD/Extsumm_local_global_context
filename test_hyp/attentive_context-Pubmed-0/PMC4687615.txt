the data presented are based on the retrieval of relevant medical literature by searching pubmed with the terms  deferasirox ( dfx )  and  non - transfusion - dependent thalassemia ( ntdt )  for studies published between 2000 and 2015 .
however , prospective data from a randomized comparison with other chelating agents and from a magnitude of drug - exposure comparable to that obtained for patients with tm should be performed to obtain a more accurate and complete evaluation of its profile in patients with ntdt .
ineffective and expanded erythropoiesis are both responsible for the activation of known and unknown signals of epcidin suppression and of a consequent increased intestinal absorption of iron.5 thus , patients with ntdt progressively increase their iron stores which may become clinically significant in the second decade of life and is responsible , along with chronic anemia and hemolysis , for most complications observed in older untreated patients.6 however , it is conceivable that , particularly in the more severe forms , some complications could be ascribed to transfusion therapy ( either intermittent or regular ) as observed for the increased risk of endocrinopathy.7 patients with ntdt accumulate iron chiefly in the liver and scantly in the heart , which may explain the tendency to not develop myocardial siderosis as compared to patients with thalassemia major ( tm).8,9 however , the liver iron overload shown in patients with ntdt has been found to be similar to that of patients with beta tm.10 the elevated iron burden , despite occurring with differences in iron metabolism , pathophysiology and loading rate , is directly involved in the development of several complications or may add in some way to their severity.11 in fact , evaluating a series of unchelated patients by r2 and r2 * magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , a liver iron concentration ( lic ) of 5 or more mg / g dry weight ( dw ) was found to be the cut - off able to accurately discriminate between patients with and without morbidities.12 recently , patients with ntdt were also found to have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and those affected showed a lic of 8.5 mg / g dw ( median : 8.5 ; interquartile range : 4.517.8).13
