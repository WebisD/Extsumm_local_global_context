, we describe a computational strategy to extract microtubule growth rates from eb1-egfp time - lapse image sequences and introduce an approach to infer parameters of microtubule dynamics in pause and shortening phases without visible comets .
we detect eb1 comets , track the comets to measure microtubule growth rates , and spatiotemporally cluster eb1 growth tracks into more complete trajectories , which include inferred shortening and pause phases ( supplementary fig .
1 ) . this method allows analysis of a large population of intracellular microtubule ends in a spatially unbiased manner .
sub - stoichiometric labeling6 allows microtubule observation deeper in the cell and could permit end tracking relative to the microtubule lattice , but the identification of microtubule ends and filaments in this context is an unresolved challenge ; to date , only a few papers describe hand - measured data from limited numbers of microtubules4,7 . an alternative strategy to visualize microtubule polymerization utilizes proteins that specifically recognize a structural property of growing microtubule plus ends , such as fluorescently - tagged end binding proteins 1 and 3 ( eb1- or eb3-egfp ) 810 .
we present a framework for the analysis of intracellular microtubule polymerization dynamics based on automatic tracking of a microtubule plus end marker such as eb1-egfp , and geometric clustering of growth tracks .
