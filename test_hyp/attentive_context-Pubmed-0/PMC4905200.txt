now , scientists have started to use light from lasers and light - emitting diodes to explore new concepts for striking back at one of humanity 's most threatening foes , cancer .
optogenetic approaches have their roots in neuroscience and date back more than a decade , when researchers first managed to control neuronal activity with light upon introduction of animal rhodopsin or microbial opsins into a variety of model organisms .
since then , optogenetics has transformed neuroscience through the dissection of neural circuitry and brain function in health and disease . over the last few years
for instance , optically activated variants of son of sevenless 1 , raf 1 , rho a , rac 1 , phosphoinositide 3 kinase p85 , and low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 6 ( activating the wnt pathway ) have been developed and used to study cellular signaling events with an unprecedented degree of spatial and temporal precision . in recent issues of the embo journal , nature communications , and chemistry & biology , collaborative work from our groups in austria and work from the group of won do heo in korea independently describe opto - rtks , receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) that can be controlled with light .
