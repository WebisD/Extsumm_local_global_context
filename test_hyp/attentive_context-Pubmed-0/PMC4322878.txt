is nowadays available for the recording of ocular dimensional profiles for up to 24 hours.15 this device has been shown to be safe and tolerable in healthy subjects and glaucoma patients as well as to provide reproducible recording of 24-hour profiles.1618 the aim of this study was to analyze the 24-hour ocular dimensional profile in normal - tension glaucoma ( ntg ) patients on medical treatment .
there was a 50% reduction in both the variability from the mean and number of peaks during sleep as compared to daytime .
continuous 24-hour ocular dimensional profiles recorded in ntg patients on medical treatment revealed that the profile increased during sleep and decreased upon waking .
the mean ocular dimensional profile of the study population increased during sleep ( positive wake - to - sleep slope ) and decreased upon waking ( negative sleep - to - wake slope ) , with the mean rate of increase during sleep being significantly greater than the rate of decrease upon waking ( p<0.001 ) .
other authors have also observed the persistence of posture - induced iop changes despite treatment of ntg patients with iop - lowering medication.20 similarly , a previous japanese study reported , in a population of ntg subjects , that the iop spikes recorded from the habitual positions ( sitting up during the day and supine at night ) were positively correlated to the spikes induced from a postural - change test and after a water - drinking test.21 in contrast , renard et al reported that , in 27 subjects with suspected ntg , 24-hour iop monitoring revealed that 54.5% exhibited a diurnal acrophase and 36.4% exhibited a nocturnal acrophase , while 9.1% had no nychthemeral rhythm in the absence of medical treatment.22 the existence of concomitant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in 80% of assessed patients could have influenced the observed iop rhythm in their cohort.22 before the availability of continuous 24-hour ocular dimensional profile recording , it has been reported that , in many glaucoma patients , the iop peaks occurred outside of office hours23,24 and that two - thirds of iop peaks in untreated glaucoma patients occurred during the nocturnal period.25 in our ntg population , we noted that there were 55% less peaks occurring nocturnally than diurnally ( p=0.001 ) .
