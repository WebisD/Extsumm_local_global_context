after two weeks of acclimatization of the animals with new environment , experimental protocols were initiated and the rats were randomly ( simple randomization ) allocated in 3 groups ( 4 rats in each group ) : ( 1 ) tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve ( snl : n = 4 ) ; ( 2 ) sham surgery ( sham :
we set the goal of this study on considering the effects of decreased activity in the form of neuropathic pain caused by ligation of the l5 spinal nerve on cdk5 and gsk-3 gene expression in soleus muscle of wistar male rats .
weight of the soleus muscle decreased in snl rats and this result indicates muscular atrophy as a consequence of tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve ( figure 3 ) . to elucidate the possible regulation of cdk5 and gsk-3 at mrna level in rat models with neuropathic pain , we examined cdk5 and gsk-3 at mrna level in soleus muscle after 4 weeks of tight ligation of l5 spinal nerves .
generally increase in gsk-3 may be related to muscular atrophy and decrease in protein synthesis , while decreases in cdk5 expression is related to structural disorders and function of skeletal muscle .
