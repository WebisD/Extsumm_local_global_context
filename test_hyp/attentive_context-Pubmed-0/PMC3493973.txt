, we describe that ng2 cells are not evenly distributed in the rat cerebellum and that their distribution and morphology undergo changes during aging .
ng2 cells ( neuron - glia chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 2 ) , also referred to as synantocytes , polydendrocytes , -astrocytes , oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( opc ) have been recognized as the fourth type of glial cells in the mammalian central nervous system , representing about 58% of the glial cell population .
a ) in the 4-month - old rat cerebellum , in the most rostral and caudal lobules , no immunoreaction product is present in the purkinje cell layer ; b , c ) representative photographs of portions of the most rostral and caudal cerebellar lobules in 28-month - old rats .
in the cerebellar vermis of 4-month - old rats , ng2 cells appear to be unevenly distributed . in lobules vi to viii according to larsell ng2 cells are uniformly and densely scattered in all cerebellar layers , including the white matter ( wm ) ; their long , slender cytoplasmic processes extend to form a spider web - like structure throughout all the cerebellar cortex ( figure 1a ) . on the contrary , in the more rostral and caudal lobules ( i  vi and ix  x ) ,
