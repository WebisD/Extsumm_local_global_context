pufa consumption change the production of important mediators and regulators of inflammation and immune responses towards a proinflammatory profile .
the unbalanced dietary consumption of n-6  :  n-3 pufa is detrimental to human health , and so the impact of dietary supplementation with n-3 pufa upon the alleviation of inflammatory diseases , more specifically , nafld needs to be more thoroughly investigated .
increases in the ratio of n-6  :  n-3 pufa , characteristic of the western diet , could potentiate inflammatory processes and consequently predispose to or exacerbate many inflammatory diseases . the change in ratio and increase in n-6
chronic conditions such as cvd , diabetes , obesity , rheumatoid arthritis , and ibd are all associated with increased production of pge2 , ltb4 , txa2 , il-1 , il-6 , and tnf- , whereby the production of these factors increases with increased dietary intake of n-6 pufa and decreased dietary intake of n-3 pufa . in conclusion ,
these are very important , active and short - lived hormones termed  eicosanoids  which are involved in various pathological processes involving inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis , obesity , and ibd . since pufa give rise to a variety of biologically active compounds which all have important roles in pathological and physiological processes , a proper understanding is needed regarding the contribution these active compounds have on the coinciding increases in inflammatory diseases seen with the disruption of the balance in the ratio of n-6  :  n-3 associated with the western diet .
