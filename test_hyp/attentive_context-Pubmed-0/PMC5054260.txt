the regulation of gene expression in the brain plays an important role in behavioral plasticity and decision making in response to external stimuli .
co - infection with the two pathogens induced the differential expression of 67 genes , including 29 genes that were also differentially expressed in brain of worker bees infected by bqcv , and 6 genes also differentially expressed in brain of bees infected by n. ceranae ; 31 genes were differentially expressed in co - infected bees only . among the latter , three cytochrome oxidase p450 genes ( loc408453 , cyp4g11 and loc412209 ) and two genes coding for odorant binding proteins ( obp4 and obp18 )
however , we found a significant overrepresentation of genes involved in immune functions that were differentially expressed in brains of bees infected with bqcv ( benjamini - hochberg corrected p  =  0.039 ) .
, we explore the genome - wide response of worker bee brains to experimental infection .
honey bees are also infected by several rna viruses , and one of the most prevalent is the positive single strand rna virus , black queen cell virus ( bqcv ) . in a previous study , we showed that bqcv and n. ceranae interact synergistically to increase worker bee mortality . using samples from the same experiment , we sequenced the brain transcriptome of worker bees infected by the two pathogens , alone or in combination , and compared it to control bees . here
