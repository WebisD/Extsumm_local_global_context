the pib nanogels / b - mbg composite has potential future use in bone tissue engineering especially for the repair of bone defects with irregular shapes because of its ability to act as a gel at injection temperatures and solidify at body temperatures . the ordered mesoporous structure , temperature - sensitive phase transition , enhanced mechanical strength , and biocompatibility make pib nanogels / b - mbg a desired biomaterial for bone tissue engineering .
furthermore , a new composite scaffold combining pib nanogels with b - mbg scaffolds was fabricated and evaluated for material characterization , mechanical properties , and in vivo early bone formation in comparison to pib nanogels alone .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of pib nanogels as a bone substitute material for the repair of femur defects in rats .
osteoporosis is a worldwide disease characterized by low bone mass and poor bone strength caused by an imbalance between bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts.1 an estimated 200 million people are affected worldwide with the great majority being women.2 reports demonstrate that within the lifetime of a patient suffering from the disease , 30%50% of women and 15%30% of men will suffer at minimum one osteoporotic - related fracture.3 a recent systematic review found that not only was life quality for these patients severely decreased , but the incidence of death for patients following hip fracture is at least doubled for an age - matched control without such fractures , and is continuously rising.4 currently the two major pharmacological approaches are anabolic agents such as parathyroid hormone which stimulates bone formation or anti - resorptive agents including bisphosphonates , calcitonin , raloxifene , and estrogen which act by inhibiting bone resorption.5 although much research to date focuses on the prevention of bone loss by using the abovementioned agents , less emphasis has been placed on the repair of defects following fracture while more than 1.5 million fractures occur annually in the united states alone.6 to date the replacement and repair of damaged or diseased tissues is largely driven by the field of tissue engineering which is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a multitude of disciplines including material science , cell biology , biotechnology , and biomaterials.7,8 mesoporous bioactive glass ( mbg ) has been widely used as a bone replacement material due to its mesoporous structure which increases surface area and allows for preferential osteoblast adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation.9,10 previously we have demonstrated that the incorporation of the trace element boron plays an important role in bone growth.9,11 boron has the ability to stimulate wound healing , facilitate the release of osteo - inductive growth factors and cytokines , and increase the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) turnover.9,11,12 boron - containing mbg ( b - mbg ) is an excellent scaffold with significantly enhanced osteogenic properties and drug delivery capability for tissue engineering compared with mbg alone.9 however , mbg as a scaffold for bone repair also has drawbacks such as inherent brittleness.13,14 in contrast , p(n - isopropylacrylamide - co - butyl methylacrylate ) ( pib ) nanogels is a temperature - sensitive cross - linking polymer and its dispersion exhibits three phase states ( swollen gel , flowable sol , and shrunken gel ) in accordance with temperature changes . it can be used to treat defects of irregular shapes and deformities as an injectable , thermoresponsive , biocompatible hydrogel for tissue engineering applications which undergoes rapid thermal gelation once the sol form reaches body temperature.15,16 recently , pib nanogels have been applied in interventional therapy for liver tumors and vascular occlusion of renal artery as a novel blood - vessel - embolic material.15,17 however to date , no study has applied this new technology for the repair of bone defects .
