the purpose of the present study is , therefore , to examine the efficacy of dpp-4 inhibitors when given as add - on therapy to the combination of metformin and sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal glycaemic control . whether asian patients respond better to triple therapy was also determined .
after triple oral therapy duration of 4.6 ( 3.66.6 ) months , their mean hba1c decreased from 8.3% ( 7.78.9 ) [ 67  mmol / mol , 6174 ] to 7.2% ( 6.87.6% ) [ 55  mmol / mol , 5160  mmol / mol ] with 26 patients ( 32.5% ) achieving an hba1c of < 7% ( 53  mmol / mol ) .
the hba1c reduction after the implementation of triple therapy was not different between the asian ( 1.00 , 0.61.3% ) and non - asian group ( 0.90 , 0.41.6% ) .
weight before ( 79.6  19.5  kg ) and after ( 78.8  19.3  kg ) triple therapy did not change significantly in the 66 patients with readings available before and after this treatment .
patients with higher baseline hba1c , absence of obesity , and younger age showed a greater response . by multiple regression analysis
