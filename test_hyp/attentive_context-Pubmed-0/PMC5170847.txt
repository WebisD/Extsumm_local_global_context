these novel approaches have allowed us to get a fresh look at processes that have been investigated for decades , leading to the capture of novel principles of stem cell biology and tissue regeneration .
my lab is fascinated by understanding how tissues renew themselves throughout an organism s lifetime . specifically , we are interested in understanding how cells orchestrate tissue growth and make cell - fate choices that result in balanced tissue regeneration .
thus , as i set up my lab , we studied tissue regeneration by investing in a high - risk / high - reward approach to establish skin stem cell imaging in live mice .
my lab has contributed to the understanding of fundamental principles of the equilibrium of cell choices reached during tissue regeneration and has explored the edges of this equilibrium , which we describe in more detail below .
we still fail to understand how stem cells and their environment balance tissue growth and regression during regeneration in a live mammal .
questions that fueled our science include , what are the rules that sustain robust daily tissue regeneration ?
thus , our scientific community at large could profit from a similar model , wherein more engagement of our members , seeing them as accountable and driving forces of the group itself , may accelerate both individual and collective growth .
