the aims of this study were as follows : evaluate patient satisfaction among patients intended for hybrid hearing and the relationship of patient satisfaction with hybrid hearing ; relate hearing results in quiet and noisy conditions to subjective experiences and residual hearing ; evaluate whether ongoing deterioration of residual hearing occurred in the hybrid - hearing patients .
2012 ) called the first group electrical complement patients and the second group electro - acoustic stimulation patients .
results showed that electric stimulation provides a major contribution to speech comprehension in partially deaf patients and that all of the patients were satisfied with their cis regardless of the variation in the extent of hearing preservation .
in this study , we evaluate patient satisfaction among patients intended for hybrid hearing and relate hearing results in quiet and noisy conditions to subjective experiences and residual hearing .
the difference between the hybrid and nonhybrid patients was not statistically significant ( p = 0.51 ) . according to the nine - question survey , 18 patients were  very satisfied  with their ci , and
low - frequency hearing losses in the operated and contralateral ears after surgery ( 125 , 250 , and 500 hz ) patient satisfaction , experience , and speech discrimination separately for the patients with natural low - frequency hearing , the patients with hearing aids in the low frequencies and the patients with a conventional ci the groups exhibited nearly identical results on all questions with the exception of question number 5 ( residual activity limitations ) for which the nonhybrid patients indicated greater limitations .
