, we discuss the landmark findings and recent advances in our understanding of astrocytes and their featured roles in regulating synapse formation , maturation , and synaptic transmission .
we propose here that , by investigating the precise roles of astrocytes during neurological disease , we are likely to achieve a broader understanding of how the brain works , in addition to new insights into disease prognosis , diagnosis , and treatment .
lastly , we explore the means by which perturbations in astrocyte function may contribute to neurological diseases , such as fxs , in the context of synaptic defects .
although few studies focus specifically on the role of astrocytes , recent work provides important examples of how a better understanding of astrocyte biology during development can enhance our knowledge about human disease . in this paper
further , we assess how astrocytes contribute to the extensive plasticity that occurs during development , highlighting the dynamic morphology of astrocyte processes and their involvement in synaptic development .
mounting evidence suggests that these versatile cells participate in a multitude of diverse processes in the central nervous system ( cns ) .
neuroscientists are now in a better position to explore and uncover the long - standing mysteries of astrocytes and gain new insights into the cellular and molecular underpinning of the nervous system .
