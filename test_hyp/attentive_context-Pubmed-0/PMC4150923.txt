the searches targeted literature on : ( i ) oesophageal cancer , chemoradiotherapy ( crt ) and functional imaging ; ( ii ) pancreatic cancer , crt and functional imaging ; ( iii ) oesophageal cancer , functional imaging and target volume definition ; ( iv ) pancreatic cancer , functional imaging and target volume definition .
four separate searches were completed on ovid medline in - process and other non - indexed citations and ovid medline 1994 to present .
further studies are required to increase the confidence in the predictive and prognostic power of functional imaging in upper gastrointestinal malignancies .
although the aim of this review was to assess the predictive and prognostic utility and the additional benefit of functional imaging on target volume definition in oesophageal and pancreatic cancer , the lack of heterogeneity in the functional imaging modalities used and the large degree of variation in technique and reporting make comparison of the results challenging .
