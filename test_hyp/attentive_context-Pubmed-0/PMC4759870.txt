therefore , the present study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of tka and efficacy of minimally invasive subvastus ( mini - subvastus ) approach in valgus knees in terms of : ( 1 ) early functional recovery ( 2 ) postoperative limb alignment and ( 3 ) incidence of complications . we hypothesized that mini - subvastus approach can be well utilized for tka in valgus knees and it results in early functional recovery with minimal complications
demographic characteristics of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty the mean ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) vas on pod1 and pod2 at rest was 2.73 ( 0.67 ) and 2.39 ( 1.11 ) , respectively and after mobilization was 3.28 ( 0.68 ) and 3.08 ( 1.20 ) , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
a mini - subvastus medial quadriceps approach provides adequate exposure for tka in valgus knees including the lateral structures , without increase in incidence of complications .
the aks and function score showed significant improvement from preoperative mean of 39 ( 11.58 ) and 36 ( 11.27 ) to 91 ( 5.04 ) and 79 ( 8.30 ) , respectively at latest followup ( p < 0.001 ) .
