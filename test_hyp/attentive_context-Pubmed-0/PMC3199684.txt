the co - morbidity of sleep disorders with neurodegenerative diseases suggests that changes in many of these neural areas manifests in sleep / wake and circadian dysfunction .
it is increasingly evident that determining the source of age - related sleep / wake or circadian dysfunctions is rather complex .
the desynchronization of central and peripheral circadian systems contributes to the decline in optimal functioning of bodily systems .
any one or a combination of these abnormalities may result in the decoupling of the circadian oscillators and the ensuing pathologies .
another source of sleep / wake changes can likely be attributed to age - related neuronal dysfunction in the arousal and sleep promoting areas of the brain .
understanding how the aging brain can compensate and remain plastic will be beneficial to focus on more effective treatments for sleep / wake and neurodegenerative disorders .
however , if mechanisms contributing to the normal aging process of these networks are identified , this may elucidate a general therapy for restoring sleep / wake and circadian homeostasis .
the fragmented sleep / wake pattern seen in aging individuals can be due to the degeneration or dysfunction of the circadian and sleep / wake networks .
