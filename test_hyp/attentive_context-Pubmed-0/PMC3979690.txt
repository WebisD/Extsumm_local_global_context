the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical studies evaluating the safety and clinical efficacy of the once - daily fixed - dose dual bronchodilator combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium bromide for the treatment of copd .
the strategy of combining short - acting bronchodilators with different mechanisms of action , ie , ipratropium bromide and salbutamol , has previously been shown to provide better symptomatic relief and to be cost - saving in patients with copd.3,4 in line with this , more recent studies have shown that also combining long - acting bronchodilators with different mechanisms of action provides additional benefits over the use of a single long - acting bronchodilator , without significantly increasing the risk of adverse effects.57 previous studies have shown that combining a long - acting 2-agonist with a long - acting anti - muscarinic antagonist leads to significant improvements in symptoms and lung function compared with either type of bronchodilator used alone.5,7 acute exacerbations of copd are associated with a poor prognosis in regard to health status , physical activity , decline in lung function , and mortality.813 prevention of exacerbations is therefore of outmost importance in the management of copd,1 and , in keeping with this , a key objective for new drugs for copd .
