the possibility of testing these novel drugs in vitro ( in primary thyroid cancer cells ) and in vivo may help to improve the personalization of treatments .
this discovery has led to the development and introduction of targeted therapies , such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) that target ret .
most cases of metastatic mtc are incurable due to resistance to conventional chemo- and radiotherapies . in recent decades , the identification of genetic defects and altered cellular signaling pathways involved in human mtc tumorigenesis have led to the development of targeted therapies , of which the most important are tyrosine kinase inhibitors . however , the low rates of partial responses or complete responses and the short duration of responses in mtc patients who were observed while taking these drugs prompted researchers to develop new drugs and alternative therapies to be combined with multi - tkis and to reduce potential cross - toxicity effects . to this end , a recent study has shown synergistic effects with a combination of sorafenib and the mek inhibitor azd6244 against a human mtc cell line .
medullary thyroid carcinoma ( mtc ) is a rare neuroendocrine cancer that originates from thyroid parafollicular calcitonin-(ct- ) producing cells .
