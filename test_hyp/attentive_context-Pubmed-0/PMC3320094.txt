, the small energy differences between structures differing only in polar proton positions adds to the confidence that the nature of the disorder , both in proton position and stacking defects , does not affect the processing .
the relative humidity dependence of the phase change between hy2 and ah and the temperature / composition phase diagram are also determined .
the relative enthalpy of ah and hy2 could only be established using innovative approaches of solution ( rh - perfusion ) and dsc measurements , as recently demonstrated for barbituric acid .
monitoring the loss of water by thermal microscopy revealed that nucleation was associated with macroscopic defects on the surface , consistent with the loss of water not being significantly affected by the stacking faults / domains and surface morphology variations , and the relationships between the crystal structures at the atomic level .
the temperature / composition phase diagram under saturated water vapor pressure , the thermal desolvation behavior , and the moisture sorption / desorption studies provide the thermodynamic and kinetic data needed for controlling the handling , processing , and storing of phg .
a broad range of analytical techniques are applied to resolve and characterize the complexity of the phg solid forms emerging from a polymorph screen , including hot - stage microscopy ( htm ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) , thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) , relative humidity ( rh)-perfusion and solution calorimetry , x - ray diffractometry ( powder and single crystal ) , infrared spectroscopy ( ir ) , and dynamic moisture sorption analysis .
