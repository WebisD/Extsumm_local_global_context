we encountered an adult patient ( index case , case 1 ) with unique benign unilateral cerebral cortical encephalitis manifesting with generalized epileptic seizure and seropositivity for mog antibody in 2014 . to explore any other cases with similar features
in the index case ( case 1 ) , we tested for mog antibody because the patient had unilateral benign on rather than unilateral cortical encephalitis with epileptic seizure .
unexpectedly , these 3 mog antibody  positive patients also had unilateral cortical encephalitis with epileptic seizure as seen in the index case , and there were no cases of unilateral cortical encephalitis with epileptic seizure without mog antibody positivity in our cohort .
then , we tested for mog antibody in our cohort of 24 consecutive adult cases of corticosteroid - responsive encephalitis of unknown etiology and identified 3 additional patients with mog antibody positivity .
, we identified 24 consecutive patients diagnosed with steroid - responsive encephalitis of unknown etiology seen at tohoku university hospital from 2008 to 2014 .
the unilateral cortical lesions best depicted by flair images were unique and appeared distinct from brain lesions previously described in mog antibody  positive diseases including adem .
the unilateral cortical lesions in our cases 14 needed to be differentiated from seizure - induced brain mri abnormalities .
