therefore , the 
 results reported here offer evidence that compounds of inhibitors could be effective 
 candidates for novel drug discovery against chicken coccidiosis .
a panel of inhibitors was tested against the 
 enzyme and three new inhibitors were identified . 

eimeripain 
 was expressed in all examined intracellular stages at both mrna and protein levels .
although 
 more detailed functional characteristics remain to be analyzed , this enzyme might correlate 
 with asexual and sexual development with a fundamental biological function .
, the eimeripain was detected as protein of 
 promature at examined in all examined stages of sporulated oocysts , and purified 
 sporozoites , merozoites and schizonts . while , mature protein was identified as 33 kda 
 molecule only at sporulated oocysts and schizonts , but not sporozoites and merozoites . 

eimeripain has been proposed as a candidate drug target to be exploited against chicken 
 coccidiosis in the future   . in those studies ,
e. tenella actin gene showed the same results with those of eimeripain 
 ( fig .
there is a 
 possibility that purified schizonts represent many developmental stages from immature to 
 mature second - generation schizonts , and thus , mature eimeripain of 54 kda might be contained 
 before complete maturation .
