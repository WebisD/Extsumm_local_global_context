this study confirms the hypothesis that cigarette smoke is a significant risk factor in the development and progression of periodontal disease and impairs the ability of gingival fibroblasts to maintain the integrity of the periodontal connective tissue .
this in vitro study is focused on the toxic nature of a volatile smoke component - acrolein on the proliferation and attachment of human gingival fibroblasts .
thus a dose - dependent inhibition of proliferation is seen and at very high concentration ( 10 ) of acrolein a complete inhibition of proliferation is noted . human gingival fibroblast attachment in acrole in treated cell cultures ( study group ) ( a ) dose - related effects of acrolein on human gingival fibroblast attachment ; ( b ) dose - related effects of acrolein on human gingival fibroblast proliferation
the present study , the human gingival fibroblast proliferation evaluated at five days indicated that the untreated cell cultures ( control group ) proliferated from 10,000 cells / well to an average of 29,697 cells / well [ table 4 , figure 2b ] . in the acrolein treated cell cultures ( study group ) , the proliferation ability decreases from 21,184 cells / well in the c5 ( 10 ) group to 10,154 in the c1 ( 10 ) group [ table 5 ] .
