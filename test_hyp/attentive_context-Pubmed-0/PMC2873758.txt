therefore , the use of bactericidal agents such as telithromycin for therapy of respiratory tract infections may well ensure that the antibacterial era endures long into the 21st century .
meeting the challenge presented by the increasing numbers of bacterial pathogens resistant to common antibiotic treatments will require new types of antibacterial agents .
his research interests include the mechanisms of antimicrobial activity , antimicrobial resistance , and the pathogenesis of chlamydia pneumoniae .
therapies that maximize bactericidal effects are important because they reduce the development of bacterial resistance mechanisms .
however , careful monitoring of resistance will be needed to ensure that this agent remains active against common pathogens .
the ability of bactericidal activity to influence therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcome has been evaluated in infections that typically are refractory to antimicrobial therapy .
all of the effects of antimicrobial agents against microbes , including the delineation of microbial resistance , are based upon the results of in vitro susceptibility testing .
these authors point out the paucity of studies that have critically evaluated the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy with results of in vitro susceptibility tests .
all are similar in that antimicrobial penetration and host defense mechanisms at the site of infection are limited .
