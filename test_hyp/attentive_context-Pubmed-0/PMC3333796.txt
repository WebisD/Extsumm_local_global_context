the aim of this research was to examine if concomitance exists between cognition and pain in the elderly residing in long - term care .
when these symptoms do coexist , little is known about the interaction of pain and cognitive decline , beyond laboratory imaging of the brain from a pathophysiological perspective.7,8 empirical studies both support and refute poor neurocognitive performance in conjunction with increased pain intensity.913 evaluating longitudinal data to assess if a relationship exists between pain and cognitive decline may assist in addressing these ambiguous findings .
theoretical modeling using clinical data is a method used to evaluate resident characteristics and symptoms for inter - relationships between variables .
a global assessment of concomitance between pain and cognition offers a unique insight towards a better understanding of the relationship of pain and cognition in a general nursing home population .
in a sample of nursing home residents , is cognitive decline a predictor of increased pain
investigating whether cognition is a predictor of pain in a concomitant relationship helped to define how secondary patient outcomes might be mediated .
the sample data do not confirm the presence of concomitance between pain and cognition in this long - term care population .
