in developed countries , management of pediatric stone disease has shifted from the historic open surgical procedures to newer minimally invasive techniques ( mis ) , e.g. , shockwave lithotripsy ( swl ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) , ureterorenoscopy ( urs ) utilizing ultrasound and laser as a source of intracorporeal lithotripsy.  although our experience is similar where mis techniques constitute the mainstay of treatment of patients with stones , large number of stone formers presenting with complex and neglected stones and their geographic / demographic variables still necessitate treatment by open surgery . in this paper , we describe the need and outcome of open surgical procedures in the era of mis from the perspective of a developing country .
this is a retrospective analysis of 3969 pediatric stone surgeries performed in 3053 patients between january 2004 and december 2008 at a tertiary care urology center .
minimally invasive surgery is the way forward ; however the pattern of stone disease , patient volume , and overall economy still gives open surgery the  therapy of choice  status in many situations .
children < 1 year and majority of infants , those with large burden were treated by open surgery .
