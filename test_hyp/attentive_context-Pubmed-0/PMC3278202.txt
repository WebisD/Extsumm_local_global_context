this study suggests that , in conjunction with toxicity and efficacy data , economic analyses are useful in defining the best maintenance strategy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsclc .
erlotinib is a cost - effective treatment option versus best supportive care when used as first - line maintenance therapy for locally advanced or metastatic nsclc in patients with stable disease .
the objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost - effectiveness of erlotinib versus best supportive care when used as first - line maintenance therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsclc and stable disease following first - line therapy in three european countries , ie , france , germany , and italy .
treatment with erlotinib in first - line maintenance resulted in a mean life expectancy of 1.39 years ( 16.7 months ) in all countries , compared with a mean 1.11 years ( 13.3 months ) with best supportive care , which represents 0.28 life - years ( 3.4 life - months ) gained with erlotinib versus best supportive care .
the cost per life - year gained was  39,783 ,  46,931 , and  27,885 in france , germany , and italy , respectively . in the probabilistic analysis , the cost per life - year gained was  39,214 ,  46,816 , and  27,864 , respectively .
