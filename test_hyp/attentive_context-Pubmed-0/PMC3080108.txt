the strategy presented here enables the determination of the higher - order structure of protein dimers using exclusively nmr data , such as backbone chemical shifts and amide nh rdcs , without the need for any prior structures of the monomeric subunits . in all cases tested here ,
we initially assume the oligomer is nonintertwined and begin by calculating the structure of the monomeric state using sparse nmr data , taking advantage of recent advances in the cs - rosetta modeling methodology .
rosetta can also provide high - resolution structures of multichain , symmetric oligomers with interleaved topologies using a protocol ( fold - and - dock ) in which the folding and docking degrees of freedom are explored simultaneously.(19 ) in the current work , we extend these approaches to allow the high accuracy oligomer structure determination from chemical shifts , limited noes , and rdcs .
the rosetta symmetric docking algorithm can effectively identify the native oligomer structure ( provided that the number of monomers in the oligomer is known from experiments ) , without need for interface noe restraints which are the main source of convergence in previously published protocols addressing this task .
analysis has shown that these inaccuracies can lead to errors in the orientation of the alignment tensor on the order of 510,(16 ) which can dramatically alter the results of docking calculations . moreover , these methods rely upon the availability of a previously determined structural model from either x - ray crystallography or conventional nmr methods.(17 ) the difficulty in interpreting rdc data in the absence of an accurate structural model limits their use in determining the structure of dimers with unknown monomer structure , thus reducing the range of targets that can be studied in solution using rdcs as the only type of experimental data that report on the arrangement of the monomeric subunits
