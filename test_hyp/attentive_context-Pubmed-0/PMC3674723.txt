preeclampsia , a pregnancy - complicated syndrome , is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality .
understanding the detailed mechanism underlying preeclampsia will help to develop novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for this condition .
the present review will focus on some new findings about interaction between v - atpase and ras , 1,25(oh)2d3 and lipoxin a4 in pregnancy , which will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying preeclampsia .
risk factors involved in preeclampsia have been increasingly identified ( table 1 ) , and emergence of any risk factor may cause a woman to develop preeclampsia . however , exact pathogenesis of this disorder remains uncertain since numerous research into the etiology of preeclampsia did not progress significantly .
the current understanding about preeclampsia is that it appears to develop in a two - stage progress , with a preclinical initial stage which has an abnormal placenta , followed by a second stage during which release of soluble factors from hypoxic placenta leads to various observed maternal conditions , including hypertension , proteinuria , and generalized damage to the maternal organ .
preeclampsia is commonly considered to result from the presence of a poor placenta since the only effective cure of the clinical syndrome is delivery of the placenta .
