in addition , it is unknown 
 how the inhibition of type i interferon production contributes to the viral infection 
 strategy when cells are infected with bvdv in vivo .
therefore , an 
 additional study is also required to reveal the fundamental mechanism by which pestiviruses 
 inhibit the production of type i interferon and how this mechanism functions in 
 vivo .
determination of complete 
 genome sequences of these viruses revealed that there were only four amino acid differences 
 between them ( table 1 ) . to clarify the molecular 
 mechanism of the inhibition of type i interferon production and the end phenomenon
n abolish its capacity to interfere with type i interferon production   . however , to 
 the best of our knowledge , there were no studies with bvdv that had approached the basic 
 mechanism of the inhibition of type i interferon production using the amino acid differences 
 between a pair of end and end viruses as well as viruses genetically 
 engineered on the basis of these differences .
the ifn bioassay of vgbk_e and three mutant viruses revealed 
 that vgbk_e and vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y exhibited the end 
 phenomenon and inhibited the production of type i interferon , whereas the n 
 mutant viruses vgbk_e
