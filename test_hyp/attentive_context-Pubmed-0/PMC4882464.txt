we used this opportunity as a means to pilot test the hexoskin for collecting data in a real - life , outdoor setting .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to utilize hxs technology to obtain data in various trail hiking situations .
we hypothesized this technology would allow us to record measures that provided face validity . while measurements of hr and ee demonstrated expected values , it was not the case for mhr , rr , or mrr . additionally , while hxs measurements of rr , sc , and ca were found to be reliable , the measurements of hr , mhr , ee and mrr returned nonsignificant intraclass correlation coefficients . based on the physiological responses that we reported in our previous investigation ( 2 ) , we expected to observe a general increase during strenuous uphill hiking when compared with both the easy - rated trail and downhill portion of the strenuous trail .
the primary purpose of this investigation was to pilot test the hxs while obtaining physiological measurements in an outdoor trail hiking setting .
hexoskin wearable technology shirt ( hxs ) is designed to measure several physiological variables including heart rate ( hr ) , respiratory rate ( rr ) , total energy expenditure ( ee ) , and total steps ( sc ) . in a laboratory - based investigation ,
