heart failure is an enormous medical and societal burden and a leading cause of hospitalization .
further studies are required to understand the association of anemia with chf outcomes , to recognize the impact of anemia improvement , to asses when to initiate and when to cease the treatment , and finally to estimate the safety of these interventions .
it seems that anemia exacerbates chf , causing a vicious circle , where renal dysfunction and neurohormonal and proinflammatory cytokine activation participate in the development of anemia . on the other hand ,
the cardio renal anemia syndrome ( cras ) represents a pathological triangle in which the primary failing organ is the heart or the kidney and the dysfunction of one organ leads to dysfunction of the other .
the role of several immunological , metabolic , and neurohormonal abnormalities has been recognized in the pathophysiology and progression of the congestive heart failure ( chf )   . among them ,
this could be explained by the fact that a significant feature of the congestive heart failure is impaired energy metabolism and therefore the failing heart is an energy - starved heart .
it is estimated that 2.6 millions hospitalizations annually in the usa are due to heart failure as a primary or secondary diagnosis . in the last 19 years
