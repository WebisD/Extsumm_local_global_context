the aim of the study was to compare the post - meiotic rate of aneuploidy using polar body biopsy and comparative genomic hybridization ( cgh ) array for all chromosomes among patients treated with coq10 and placebo .
in addition , cohesin complexes and shugoshins have been shown to lose function after prolonged exposure to ros.33 tarin et al have shown that the administration of the antioxidants vitamins e and c was able to correct some of the age - related decline in reproduction in mice.34 quinzii et al used a model of gradual inhibition of coq10 production creating different levels of coq10 deficiency.29 they were able to show that at the level of coq10 typically seen in the elderly , the effect observed in mitochondrial function is not a decline in atp production , but rather an increase in ros production . in reviewing these data , we conclude that the administration of coq10 for two months , although sufficient to correct a potential lack of atp in the oocyte , might not be enough to prevent the effects of prolonged exposure to ros on the meiotic apparatus . more research is needed to study the effects of a longer duration of intake of coq10 on female reproductive function in women of various ages .
