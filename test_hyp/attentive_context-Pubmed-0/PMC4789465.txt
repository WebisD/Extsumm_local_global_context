we were able to synthesize some naproxen - metal derivatives and to highlight their stability profile under stressed conditions with a view to facilitating the invention of novel nsaids with better therapeutic efficacy .
search for drugs of higher efficacy and lower toxicity is a never ending effort . in our current research
this finding suggests that the metal derivatives of naproxen can be more potent anti - inflammatory agent in human body with longer half - life as well as in the dosage form with longer shelf life when compared to the parent naproxen .
also , the rp - hplc method for analysis of naproxen outlined in usp has been verified for the drug - metal complexes .
low quantity of % rsd of area changes demonstrated that the drugs were fairly stable in the diluting solution and in the mobile phase .
the rp - hplc studies were performed in order to determine identity of the new synthetic products in comparison to the free ligand with respect to retention time .
but from the result of present study further useful information was achieved that the metal derivatives of naproxen were found more stable than naproxen itself .
