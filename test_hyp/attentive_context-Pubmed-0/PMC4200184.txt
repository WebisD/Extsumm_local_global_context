our study showed that the acute complications of intracavitary brachytherapy can be minimized by pre - treatment management of associated comorbidities , decreasing the duration of operative lithotomy position , routine use of 3d imaging in all insertions etc .
events occurring within 30 days from the date of insertion of brachytherapy necessitating hospitalization or death. due to few number of cervical cancer patients in developed countries and still fewer number in advanced stage , information in this respect in world literature is sparse . here , we are reporting our experience of acute complications following hdr brachytherapy in gynecological malignancies , and have tried to identify the causative factors to further reduce the already low rate of acute complications .
from february 2004 to december 2012 , a total of 1947 patients with gynecological malignancies were treated by ebrt and icrt .
treatment with both tandem and ovoids was attempted in 1468 cervical and 59 endometrial ( with intact uterus ) cancer patients .
stage iii was the most common ( 62% ) in cervical cancer patients followed by stage ii ( 28% ) , whereas , most of the endometrial cancer patients were of stage i ( 41% ) and ii ( 38% ) . most of the patients of both the groups had karnofsky performance status  90 .
