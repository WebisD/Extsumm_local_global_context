the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of implant - supported restoration in aplastic anemic patients by evaluating radiographic and clinical features .
a 44-year - old woman presented to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of chonnam national university hospital ( gwangju , korea ) to evaluate missing teeth in the maxilla and the mandible and possible implant - supported restoration .
thus , based on these results , implant surgery can be performed safely even for patients with hematologic disorders by applying three principles of implant installation ; induction of initial hemostasis , maintenance of hemostasis during the healing period , and immobilization of the implant .
stable , rigid , fixated implants have been reported with pocket depths ranging from 2 to 6 mm15 ; in the presented case , the mean probing depth was 1.66 mm after 21.4 months of prosthetic loading .
this study evaluated the following parameters ; 1 ) the amount of peri - implant bone resorption , 2 ) level of osseointegration as measured by the amount of fine trabecular bone in close contact with the fixture , 3 ) probing depth , and 4 ) periabutment gingival connective tissue contour .
