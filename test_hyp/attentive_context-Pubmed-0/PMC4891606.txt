, we describe a case of a 73-year - old woman who developed an abdominal wall hematoma , which is a rare but serious complication of a pci via the femoral approach .
abdominal wall hematoma is a rare condition that can give rise to an acute abdomen . in this report
vascular complications are the most frequent adverse outcomes associated with percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) via the femoral artery .
when vascular complications are suspected during the procedure , a staged pci should be considered to prevent periprocedural vascular complications and ensure a patient s safety . with more coronary angiographic procedures being performed , it is important for clinicians to consider the possibility of abdominal wall hematoma in this situation , especially when the patient has many predisposing factors .
a 73-year - old woman , with a past medical history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus for 40 years , and chronic kidney disease stage 5 , because of diabetic nephropathy , presented to the emergency department with dyspnea ( nyha iv ) .
fluoroscopy - guided femoral artery puncture and guidewire insertion may reduce the rate pci - related vascular complications .
they contribute to in - hospital morbidity , mortality , and costs ; and furthermore , are associated with increased long - term risk of myocardial infarction and death .
