we herein report a case of bronchial atresia associated with pneumothorax which was successfully treated with lobectomy .
bronchial atresia resulting from a localized defect in normal bronchopulmonary embryogenesis is a rare disease .
we report a case of bronchial atresia in the subsegmental branch of the posterior segmental bronchus of the right upper lobe associated with mucocele and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax , which was treated with right upper lobectomy .
it can produce emphysematous changes in the affected pulmonary segment or lobe with or without dyspnea and/or episodic pulmonary infection .
a 32-yr - old korean male patient was admitted to inha university hospital , incheon , korea due to dyspnea and right chest pain for 1 day . on physical examination ,
he had a history of the right pneumothorax one and a half years ago , which was treated with tube thoracostomy .
the resected specimen showed atresia of the subsegmental branch of the posterior segmental bronchus of the right upper lobe with hyperinflated lung with subpleural bullae .
however , we think the bullous change have been resulted from mechanical stress to the alveoli wall from hyperinflation of the lung parenchyma distal to the atretic bronchus due to aeration by check - valve mechnanism through the collateral channels of the interalveolar pores of kohn and bronchoalveolar channels of lambert .
