the aim of the study was to compare and evaluate flank and midventral laparotomy approaches in goats .
there were variations of total white blood cells ( wbc ) count of the two approaches before surgery , at 1824 hours , and at the first and second week after surgery ; the midventral group had higher wbc value at all the intervals with significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) at first and second week after surgery ( table 4 ) .
there were slight variations of means subjective healing interval of the two approaches but without significant difference ( p = 0.643 ) , with the flank approach having higher means number of days ( 13  1.14 ) to complete surgical wound healing when compared with 12.4  0.5 mean days for midventral approach .
the intraoperative hemorrhage score recorded was higher in the flank approach compared with the midventral approach , though without significant difference ; this could be a result of high vascular channels available in the abdominal muscle mass when compared to poor vasculatures associated with tendons and ligament in the linea alba .
the flank approach at 1824 hours had higher erythema score ( 1.40  0.55 ) when compared with midventral group ( 0.80  0.45 ) and there was significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) of erythema between the two approaches ( table 2 ) . at 1014 days after surgery , flank approach had higher erythema score ( 0.25  0.50 ) while midventral approach had no erythema record and there was significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) between the two approaches .
