, we devised the implicitly polarized charge model 
 ( ipolq ) , based on a new quantum mechanical 
 method that integrates the condensed - phase environment due to explicit 
 water molecules into quantum calculations at the mp2 level of theory . 
 in this method ,
while the ipolq approach offers numerous 
 benefits for creating a self - consistent force field , the process of 
 deriving charges is laborious , and our previous work did not assign 
 torsion fourier terms to complete the model . in this article , we will 
 extend the ipolq method to facilitate derivation of complete models , 
 and we will also describe automation of the procedure , which greatly 
 reduces the human effort needed to create new force fields for proteins 
 and drug - like molecules .
the 
 choice of tip4p - ew to represent the solution - phase 
 environment while developing the protein force field supports the 
 use of this water model for later simulations .
the appropriate atomic partial charges of a nonpolarizable 
 model are estimated to be halfway between the charges of the system 
 in vacuum and those of a system fully polarized in the presence of 
 a condensed - phase reaction field potential .
