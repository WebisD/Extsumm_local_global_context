they , under the mission , seek to provide universal access to equitable , affordable and quality maternal health care , as well as to bring about an improvement in the health status of the pregnant women belonging to underprivileged sections of the society . in this perspective , the present study aimed to find out the determinants of utilization of antenatal care services by the beneficiaries in rural lucknow .
however , significant relation was found between three ante natal care visits and age ( or = 1.189 , 95% ci = 1.029  3.433 ) , ses ( or = 1.888 , 95% ci = 1.009  3.533 ) , and timing of antenatal registration ( or = 2.667 , 95% ci = 1.427  4.984 ) .
keeping in view the gap between the target and reality , national rural health mission ( nrhm ) was launched in april 2005 , to improve the rural health care delivery system and health status of the people .
elder rdws and those with early registration were found to be more likely to have at least three antenatal care visits . encouraging early registration and more focus on young mothers should be the thrust areas in maternal health program .
