further work in this system has the potential to increase our understanding of how ion channel function influences cell physiology through an opportunity to measure the benefits and costs of changes in sodium channel structure on the proper functioning of nerve and skeletal muscle tissue .
voltage - gated sodium channels ( nav ) are membrane - bound proteins that initiate action potentials in nerve and muscle cells and are critical elements of proper function in these tissues . the channels open when the voltage across the cell membrane is depolarized by a few millivolts above the normally negative resting membrane potential .
action potentials act as electrical messages that travel along the axons of nerve cells and the surface of muscle fibers initiating the release of neurotransmitters by neurons and coordinating contractions in muscle .
an early model of the two - dimensional folding pattern of the  subunit predicted that the protein consists of four homologous domains ( di - iv ) composed of six -helical transmembrane segments ( s1s6 ) and that the regions of the protein between segments s5 and s6 of all four domains reenter the membrane to form the outer pore of the channel through which sodium ions enter the cell .
