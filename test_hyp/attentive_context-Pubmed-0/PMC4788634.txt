bedside ultrasound evaluation and assessment of the electrical diaphragmatic activity are promising tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory muscle dysfunction / vidd .
the clinical hallmark is respiratory muscle weakness which contributes to weaning failure and thus implies a significant health care burden .
currently , respective findings from animal models can partially be reproduced in human experiments and find their way to the clinical bedside.2 within the complex of critical illnessrelated weakness,3 , 4 , 5 the dysfunction of respiratory muscles , particularly of the diaphragm , represents a highly relevant and distinct clinical problem in intensive care units ( icus ) . from a clinical perspective , diaphragmatic dysfunction contributes to difficult weaning or even failure to wean from mechanical ventilation in icu patients .
vidd , the condition does not exclusively affect the major respiratory muscle ( i.e. the diaphragm ) , but may also involve the intercostal musculature to a minor degree.14 , 15 the diaphragm , however , seems particularly prone to dysfunction under mechanical ventilation while auxiliary respiratory muscles , e.g. pectorales muscles,16 or skeletal limb muscles ( e.g. soleus or extensor digitorum muscles ) are typically spared.17 , 18 , 19 , 20 
  while many of the pathophysiological aspects of vidd that were found in animals have also been successfully reproduced in humans , the proof of decreased force generation was so far only performed indirectly in mechanically ventilated patients.21 only very recently , direct force generation of isolated human muscle fibres was studied with ambiguous results.22 , 23 , 24
