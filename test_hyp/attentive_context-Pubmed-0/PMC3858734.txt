therefore , the aim of this study was to compare the level of salivary estrogen and progesterone in otherwise healthy pregnant women with gt and without gt .
the mean level of progesterone was 0.72  0.09 ng / mi and 0.72  0.04 in the 1 , 1.14  0.11 and 1.21  0.13 in the 2 and 1.3  0.14 and 1.28  0.24 in the 3 trimester of pregnancy in control and case groups respectively [ figure 2 ] .

the mean level of estrogen in saliva 3 periods of pregnancy for both groups : case and control the results of t - test analysis showed no significant difference between both groups in each trimester of pregnancy ( p = 0.07 ) .
the mean level of estrogen was 49.4  1.2 ng / mi and 52.32  1.3 in the 1 , 71.05  1.7 and 74.12  2.2 in the 2 and 109.1  0.7 and 112.16  1.2 in the 3 trimester in control and case groups respectively [ figure 1 ] .
