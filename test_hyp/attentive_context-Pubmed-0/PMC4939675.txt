the inclusion of mitotic catastrophe as part of a microscopic evaluation may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of this rare entity and for new cancer treatment modalities .
pleomorphic carcinoma is an aggressive tumour initially described in the lung by nash and stout . in the 4th edition of the world health organization
histological patterns of micro- and multinucleation have been used as morphological markers for the detection of mitotic catastrophe   . a high frequency of multinucleated giant cells is characteristically found in pleomorphic carcinomas . in this report , we present an additional case of primary pleomorphic carcinoma of the colon , and we underline similarities to and differences from pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma .
we described a rare case of pleomorphic carcinoma of the right colon showing opposing clinicopathological features . although it was classified as a grade 4 tumour , it was characterized by a pushing growth pattern and presented only one lymph node with metastasis .
( who ) classification of tumours of the lung , pleomorphic carcinoma is defined as a poorly differentiated ( squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma ) or undifferentiated carcinoma in which at least 10% spindle and/or giant cells are identified , or as a carcinoma constituted purely of spindle and giant cells .
