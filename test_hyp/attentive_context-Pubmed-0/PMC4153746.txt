governance should be taken into account in global health efforts to reduce the under-5 mortality rate in the context of global urbanization , economic growth , and disease control .
the objective of our study was to investigate the ecological association between governance and child mortality and to provide global health efforts with further evidence of the need for better governance .
global health communities should start collecting useful information related to indicators of governance and initiate studies into the causal pathways between governance and important socioeconomic determinants of population health .
countries should target their efforts toward providing healthier physical and social living environments through better governance .
we aimed to investigate how country - level child mortality is associated with urbanization , economic development , disease control , and governance . to address this issue , we collected publicly available country - specific data and conducted cross - national comparisons and longitudinal data modeling .
this study contributes to our understanding of global child health issues by showing the significant association between governance and under-5 mortality rates at country level , taking into account factors of development ( mainly urbanization and economy ) and disease control ( mainly hygienic conditions and immunization rates ) . as the difference in child mortality rates between countries remained as high as 89-fold in 2010 , our results indicate that the effect of governance on child mortality is just as important as the effect of development and disease control
