we present a patient with refractory epilepsy who , following initially apparently successful unilateral temporal lobectomy , developed recurrent seizures and profound amnesia , and in whom subsequent investigations unexpectedly suggested an autoimmune aetiology .
adverse cognitive sequelae of epilepsy surgery have been well - recognised since the seminal report of scoville and milner in 1957 documenting the dense anterograde amnesia in patient h.m .
surgical resections such as unilateral temporal lobectomy and amygdalo - hippo - campectomy have an established place in the management of carefully selected patients with refractory localisation - related epilepsy .
such amnesia has been observed on occasion following unilateral surgery , reflecting preoperative damage in the unoperated , contralateral , temporal lobe , a finding which mandates careful preoperative assessment of the non - operated hemisphere , for example using sodium amytal ( wada ) testing and/or functional neuroimaging , to try to ensure cognitive function is preserved post - operatively .
we recommend that the possibility of anti - gad le needs to be considered in all patients with refractory epilepsy of presumed temporal lobe origin , including those being considered for epilepsy surgery , especially those whose clinical course is not typical for mesial temporal sclerosis .
