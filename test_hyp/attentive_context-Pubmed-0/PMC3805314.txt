understanding 
 fundamental controls on water consumption and withdrawal 
 of thermoelectric generation within the context of power plant fleets 
 with long lifespans and legacy infrastructure is an essential prerequisite 
 to assessing impacts of water availability on thermoelectric generation 
 and impacts of thermoelectric generation on water resources .
quantitative information on water use and understanding of controls 
 provided by this study should be very valuable for future management 
 of water and energy to ensure reliable electric generation .
this work builds on a previous study quantifying 
 water consumption for thermoelectricity in texas in 2006 by taking advantage of improvements in eia data 
 since 2006 and focusing on controls rather than on future projections . 

the importance of generator 
 technology controlling water consumption with up to 63% reduction 
 in consumption intensity for ngcc plants relative to traditional sts 
 ( 0.19 vs 0.52 gal / kwh ) is very important , with projected future expansion 
 of ngcc plants in texas and throughout the u.s .
( www.eia.org ) requiring water for cooling in thermoelectric 
 ( steam electric ) power plants , it is important to understand how much 
 water is used for thermoelectric generation to assess vulnerability 
 of power generation to water shortages and determine potential impacts 
 of generation on water resources .
