our data support the concept that when ragweed pollen is exposed to o3 during its time in the atmosphere , it can suffer damage that is seen as decreased pollen viability , and it can become more allergenic through stimulation of inflammatory ros - generating nad(p)h oxidase , which would be released when pollen comes into contact with the cells of the respiratory apparatus .
in particular , we determine first whether o3 can increase the allergy potency of ragweed pollen by stimulating allergen and nad(p)h oxidase release , and secondly whether o3 can induce physiological alterations that affect pollen viability , which is the ability of the pollen to complete post - pollination events and to achieve fertilisation .
in this study , we have sought to simulate the effects of acute o3 exposure on ragweed pollen after its dispersion in the atmosphere . for this purpose , under laboratory conditions , the ragweed pollen was exposed to 5  h of 100  nl  l o3 for 7 days , with some of the biochemical and molecular features of the pollen grains then analysed .
we specifically evaluated : ( i ) pollen ros and no content , as no is considered to be a mediator of inflammatory responses ( moilanen and vapaatal , 1995 ) ; ( ii ) activity of the nad(p)h oxidase , which can generate ros ; ( iii ) expression of the major ragweed pollen allergens ; and ( iv ) pollen viability .
