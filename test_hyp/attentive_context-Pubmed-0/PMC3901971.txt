the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of weight loss , after 1 year of the roux - en - y gastric bypass surgery ( rygb ) , on the lung volumes and the respiratory muscle strength in obese women .
additionally , there was also a reduction in the respiratory muscle strength , which could be caused by a loss of lean body mass and a reduction in the work of breathing after weight loss .
moreover , in assessing respiratory muscle strength , a reduction statistically significant in the values of mip and mep was recorded ( table 3 ) .
based on the obtained results , it was established that 1 year after the rygb surgery , the patients showed a significant reduction in the measures of weight , bmi , and w / h ratio , especially changes in the lung function tests , such as spirometry and respiratory muscle strength .
however , when examining the components of the vc separately , an increase in erv and reduction of irv , keeping the vt unchanged 1 year after surgery , was observed .
studies by some authors   have shown an improved lung function in patients evaluated after 1 year following weight loss induced by bariatric surgery , and others have attributed this improvement mainly to the reduction in the w / h ratio .
