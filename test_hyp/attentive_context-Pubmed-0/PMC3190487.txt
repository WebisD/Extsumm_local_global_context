traditionally , barium examinations have been the mainstay of radiological investigations of the small and large intestines . however , the standard barium follow - through ( sbft ) examination has high false - negative and false - positive rates for the detection of abnormalities
several new techniques have therefore evolved that provide better diagnostic capabilities and higher accuracy rates.  in this article , the newer techniques and modalities being employed for imaging of the bowel are detailed , with an overview of their strengths and weaknesses .
this is because only 2535% of the bowel length can be adequately assessed on a standard examination due to overlapping loops , poor coating , and other factors .
perfusion ct is a reflection of angiogenesis in tumors , and therefore its main use is in the assessment of colorectal tumors and their response to treatment .
innovations in intestinal imaging have been driven by the demand for detailed clinical information and the limitations of standard methods of small - bowel examination .
the role of pet / ct in intestinal imaging is mainly related to cancer imaging and the detection of distant metastases .
diffusion - weighted mri image shows high signal in the cancer tissue ( arrow ) and involved lymph node in the mesorectum ( short arrow ) perfusion imaging : perfusion ct is a technique that integrates anatomic detail with assessment of vascular physiology .
