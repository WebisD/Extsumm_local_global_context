the timed up and go ( tug ) test and berg balance scale ( bbs ) measure mobility / balance and have demonstrated high reliability in patients with ms . the objective of mobile was to explore the effect of pr - fampridine on endpoints related to patients self - assessed walking disability and dynamic / static balance , assessed using the bbs and tug , as well as to subjective impression of well - being and patients impression of change in walking .
overall , these findings provided additional support for the potential of pr - fampridine to result in clinically meaningful improvements in walking quality / ambulatory function in patients with ms with walking disability .
prolonged - release ( pr ) fampridine tablets ( known as sustained / modified - release fampridine in some countries and extended - release dalfampridine in the united states ) are approved for improving walking in ms based on results from two pivotal trials that demonstrated consistent improvements in walking speed on the timed 25-foot walk and on patients self - assessment of ambulatory disability on the 12-item ms walking scale ( msws-12 ) .
nevertheless , the results of mobile support that pr - fampridine therapy provides significant and sustained improvements in walking characteristics beyond walking speed ; in particular , pr - fampridine therapy resulted in early and sustained benefits on measures of dynamic and static balance and mobility as well as patient - reported walking disability .
