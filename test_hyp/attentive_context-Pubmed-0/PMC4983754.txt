these studies rationalize further investigations on the therapeutic benefits of mglur modulators that can finely tune glutamatergic transmission in an effort to treat various psychiatric and neurologic conditions .
selective allosteric ligands for group iii mglur subtypes were recently discovered ; this has made it possible to elucidate the role of each of these receptors in normal cns functioning and in models of neurologic and psychiatric disorders .
the actions of glutamate , the main excitatory neuro-  transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system ( cns ) , can be finely modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mglurs )   .
mglur7 exhibits high expression in excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the brain , which are considered critical for neurologic and pathologic disorders .
these effects were later confirmed by similar findings obtained using selective mglur7 allosteric modulators . moreover , some of the novel mglur7 negative allosteric modulators , apart from clarifying the function of mglur7 in fine tuning excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the cns , have confirmed the mglur7-knockout phenotype and clarified the role of mglur7 in neuropsychiatric disorders . in this context , mmpip and xap044 have also been tested in models of neuropathic pain and have shown promising anti - allodynic , anti - anxiety- , and anti - depressant - like effects .
