we can conclude that type 1 fimbriae is present among upec as well as other strains of e. coli , to the extent that the fimh gene was detected in more than 90% of the e. coli strains . the high binding ability of fimh could result in increased bacterial binding to target cells and increased pathogenicity of e. coli ; thus , fimh could be used to design vaccine for prevention of e. coli infections by blocking the bacterial attachment and colonization .
the present study was conducted for detection of the fimh virulence gene from upec isolated from both hospitalized patients and outpatients with uti , referred to educational hospitals of shahrekord , iran .
for more subsequent investigations , the fimh gene was detected in upec strains isolated from hospitalized and out - patients with uti , referred to educational hospitals of shahrekord .
the presence of the fimh gene was confirmed by pcr and the results indicated that the fimh gene was present in 130 upec isolates ( 92.8% ) ; 62 isolates ( 47.7% ) of hospitalized patients and 68 ( 52.3% ) of outpatients .
( 15 ) reported that among the studied virulence genes of upec strains , the fimh gene was the most prevalent virulence gene and was found in 68% ( 61/90 ) of the uti isolates .
