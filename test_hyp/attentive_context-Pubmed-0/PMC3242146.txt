we evaluated apparently healthy fish and invertebrate samples collected from a commercial aquarium in korea for the presence of betanodavirus , by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr)-based techniques , to determine whether these imported aquarium fishes and invertebrates might be one of the sources of vnn .
other positive nested pcr results were obtained from the brains of 2 apparently healthy freshwater fish species , south american leaf fish ( monocirrhus polyacanthus ) , red piranha ( pygocentrus nattereri ) and the marine invertebrate , the spiny lobster ( pamulirus versicolor ) .
the fact that this virus was detected in produce imported from foreign countries implies an urgent necessity for the establishment of a quarantine system in korea . until such laws have been implemented ,
the results of this study indicate the possibility of a new route of the infection into cultured fish populations .
2 of 45 freshwater aquarium fish from the amazon river also tested positive for nodavirus by nested pcr .
positive nested pcr results were obtained from the brain samples of 8 apparently healthy marine aquarium fish species : shrimp fish ( aeoliscus strigatus ) , milkfish ( chanos chanos ) , three spot damsel ( dascyllus trimaculatus ) , japanese anchovy ( engraulis japonicus ) , pinecone fish ( monocentris japonica ) , blue ribbon eel ( rhinomuraena quaesita ) , look down fish ( selene vomer ) and the yellow tang ( zebrasoma flavesenes ) .
