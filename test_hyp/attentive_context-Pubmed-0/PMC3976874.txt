thus , we aimed to analyse the spatiotemporal expression of placental fractalkine and tested the hypothesis whether it can be shed and released into the intervillous space , that is , the maternal circulation .
increased expression and release of placental fractalkine may contribute to low grade systemic inflammatory responses observed in third trimester of normal pregnancy .
migration and adhesion studies by the same group suggested fractalkine to be involved in embryo implantation processes . recently , increased placental fractalkine expression was suggested to contribute to increased microvessel density in placental tissue from pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus . in the light of the broad panel of factors released from human placenta
was tested for its capacity to express and release the chemokine . while basal expression of fractalkine mrna was low but detectable in untreated bewo cells , incubation with forskolin , a reagent known to induce bewo cell differentiation and syncytialization , led to a time dependent increase over time with a 22.1-fold ( 1.6 ) upregulation compared to vehicle control after 48  h ( figure 3(a ) ) .
however , the ratio of released versus tissue associated fractalkine remained constant and was 2.1 in both first trimester and term placental explants , suggesting constitutive shedding of placental fractalkine . in order to determine any cytotoxic effects of batimastat on placental explants ,
