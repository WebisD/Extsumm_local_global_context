in addition to cost , there are other problems such as delays in delivery , changes in quality and affinity of conjugate and sometimes lack of access . here , we tried to overcome these problems and we successfully achieved the first step for producing the anti - np conjugate by extraction and purification of rabies virus np from cell culture .
this study was conducted to extract np from baby hamster kidney cell clone ( bsr ) infected with the pasteur vaccine strain ( pv ) and to purify this np in order for it to be used in the future for producing a fluorescent anti - np conjugate with high sensitivity and specificity , which can be used in fat .
it is the main component of the rabies virion that contains group - specific antigenic determinants , which are important in diagnosis of rabies infection ( 1 , 11 ) .
more than 130,000 people received post - exposure prophylaxis thus , a sensitive surveillance system is necessary to detect rabies infections using the most accurate laboratory methods recommended by who ( 12 , 15 ) . at the pasteur institute of iran ( who collaborating center for reference and research on rabies ) , a rabies conjugate is provided by bio - rad with a high price .
