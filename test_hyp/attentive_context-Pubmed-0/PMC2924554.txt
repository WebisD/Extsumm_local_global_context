however , further studies with longer term follow - up and larger patient groups are needed to establish the position of ablative technologies in the treatment of renal tumors and to extend their application to renal tumors in endophytic locations .
if the surgical and oncological outcomes support the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic cryoablation ( lrc ) for endophytic renal tumors , and safety can be maintained during the surgical procedure , this method may provide an alternative nephron - sparing surgery for selected patients . to determine this
, we evaluated the intermediate - term outcome of lrc in patients with endophytic rcc .
in this series with an intermediate - term follow - up , lrc for small endophytic tumors showed acceptable oncological and surgical outcomes without adverse effects in the collecting system . these results also emphasize that careful preoperative design of the layout of the cryoprobes and the use of multiple cryoprobes should be given special consideration , especially in endophytic cases .
all patients underwent a preoperative radiologic evaluation with contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in the case of renal insufficiency to delineate the parameters of the renal lesion , including location , size , depth , and position relative to hilar vessels and the collecting system .
