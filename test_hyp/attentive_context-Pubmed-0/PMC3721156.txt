this study aims to model the financial benefits of implementing an electronic medical record ( emr ) system for hospitals in low - income settings . to date
we quantify three areas of significant potential cost savings of an emr system based on non - emr data from a hospital in lilongwe , malawi : ( 1 ) length of stay ; ( 2 ) transcription time ; and ( 3 ) laboratory use .
the limited attention given to analyzing financial soundness has been couched solely in high - income settings .
understanding the benefits of emr in low - income settings is a burgeoning area of research that so far has focused on the clinical effects , but the adoption of emr in any setting also depends on articulating the financial soundness of the initial investment .
although this means that implementing an extensive emr system would require a long - term approach to budgeting , the timing of such an undertaking may be right ; the objectives of the 2011 malawi health sector strategic plan reflect a similarly long time - horizon and articulate goals that overlap well with the known strengths of emr .
these aims included interest in systems for laboratory information , revenue management , continuous monitoring and evaluation , and improved vital registration.36 these results suggest that the dialogue surrounding emr in low - income settings should focus on how , rather than whether , to make these investments .
