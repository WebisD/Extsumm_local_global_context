the aim of the present study was to assess the relative importance of clinical and transport - related determinants influencing physicians ' decision - making in interhospital transport of critically ill patients .
determinants reflecting the critically ill patient 's condition and intensity of treatment were scored to be of relative minor importance [ dose of noradrenaline :   =  0.6 ( 1.0 to 0.1 ) ; arterial oxygenation   =  0.8 ( 1.3 to 0.4 ) ; level of peep
ref , reference value ; peep , positive end - expiratory pressure ; ventric , ventricular ; ic , intensive care relative weight ( expressed in  , 95% confidence interval ) of determinants influencing the decision on interhospital ic transport . ref , reference value ; peep , positive end - expiratory pressure ; ventric , ventricular ; ic , intensive care repeated analyses did not demonstrate significant differences in relative weights of the determinants in relation to respondents ' working location ( regional hospital vs. large teaching hospital or academic medical center ) , type of medical speciality , or method of data collection ( paper vs. online ) .
those with the largest negative effects on preference for transportability were the type of escorting personnel [ paramedic only :   =  3.1 ( 3.7 to 2.5 ) ; ic nurse and paramedic :   =  2.1 ( 2.5 to 1.7 ) ; team of ic physician , nurse , and paramedic :   =  1.0 ( 1.2 to 0.8 ) ; standard ambulance :   =  1.21 ( 1.7 to 0.8 ) ] .
