more recently , fasicularin , isolated from nephteis fasicularis , was reported as a cytotoxin to vero cells and was found to act as a dna - damaging agent in the assay using a dna repair - deficient yeast strain . as a part of collaborative investigation of biologically active compounds from indonesian marine organisms , we herein report the isolation and structures of two new tricyclic alkaloids polycitorols a ( 1 ) and b ( 2 ) together with known lepadiformine ( 3 ) from a marine ascidian .
tricyclic alkaloids represented by cylindricines , lepadiformine ( 3 )   and fasicularin   are unique metabolites of ascidians .
the new compounds contain a butyl side chain instead of a hexyl group observed more commonly in known related compounds .
the structures and relative stereochemistries were unambiguously established by x - ray crystallography of their corresponding picrates . moreover ,
cylindricines a and b isolated from clavelina cylindrical   were the first members of the family based on the perhydropyrrolo[2,1-j]quinoline and the perhydropyrido[2,1-j]quinoline ring systems , respectively .
the relative stereochemistry of a / b rings was shown to be identical to that in 1 with a c-2 butyl side chain based on similar noe data , particularly a set of mutual noe enhancements between h-2 , h-4ax and h-9ax .
