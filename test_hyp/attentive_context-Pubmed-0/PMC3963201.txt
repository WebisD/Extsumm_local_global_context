we describe a case of a patient with lemierre 's syndrome whose the diagnosis was not suspected until blood culture grew fusobacteirum necrophorum .
lemierre 's syndrome is a septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein ( ijv ) commonly caused by anaerobic oropharyngeal flora that is usually followed by fulminant sepsis and rapid death in the pre - antibiotic era . since the introduction of antibiotics , the morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome have been dramatically decreased .
lemierre 's syndrome or postanginal sepsis is a rare , but potentially fatal infection of the ijv .
an otherwise healthy 36-year - old male presented to our institute with a 4-day history of low - grade fever accompanied by sore throat , myalgia and nausea .
however , delay in diagnosis and antibiotic treatment resulting in poor clinical outcome is not uncommon as physicians are less familiar with this infection and initial manifestations are often non - specific .
we report a case of healthy young male who presented with flu - like symptoms and was initially mistaken for viral upper respiratory tract infection .
patient was finally diagnosed with lemierre 's syndrome and remained stable through rest of the hospital course .
