evacon realises the continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction servers , using the facilities of the eva system for assessing the servers , retrieving the new structures from pdb and building homogeneous datasets for testing the methods ( 16,17 ) .
evacon evaluates raw contact predictions produced by the contact specialists and also evaluates , in terms of implicitly predicted 3d contacts , methods for the full reconstruction of protein models ( i.e. comparative modelling and threading / fold recognition servers ) .
the system is composed of three different modules : one of them provides a fast view of the results through static pages that are regenerated every week . the second one is composed of a query - based system that allows a flexible display of the results .
overall , the results are potentially informative about the ability of the contact specialists to produce 3d restraints , something that could be used by other ab initio methods to produce protein models , or that could be used as additional information to select models generated by other prediction methods ( 1315 ) .
the results of evacon allow a direct comparison between contact predictions produced by the specialists and predictions extrapolated from the 3d models produced by protein structure prediction servers .
