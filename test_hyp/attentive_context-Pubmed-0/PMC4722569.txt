he underwent emergency wound debridement , and the ulna was stabilised with an intra - medullary square nail .
he had an uneventful recovery and at three - month follow - up , the fractures had healed radiographically in anatomic alignment . at two - year follow - up , he is doing well , is pain free and has a normal range of motion compared to the contralateral side .
horse bites behave as compound fractures however rabies prophylaxis will be needed and careful observation is needed .
there was deformity of the forearm with multiple puncture wounds , deep abrasions and small lacerations on the distal - third of the forearm .
copious irrigation with normal saline was done and he was administered anti - tetanus and postexposure rabies prophylaxis .
a 35-year - old male farm - worker presented to the emergency room with alleged history of horse bite to the right forearm about 2 hours prior to presentation while feeding the horse .
early radical debridement , preliminary skeletal stabilisation , re - debridement and conversion osteosynthesis to plate , and antibiotic prophylaxis were the key to the successful management of our patient .
the systematic treatment protocol of early radical debridement , preliminary skeletal stabilisation , re - debridement and conversion osteosynthesis to plate , and antibiotic prophylaxis were the key to the successful management of our patient .
