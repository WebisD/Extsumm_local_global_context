thus , the purpose of this study was to measure the dc of two commercially dual - cured resin cements in different viscosities ( low and high ) when they were light - activated or when the materials were allowed to self - cure solely , after 5 minutes and 24 hours from the mixture of pastes ( base and catalyst ) .
twenty - four hours after seating the indirect restoration is appropriate for final oclusal adjustments , finishing , and polishing procedures , which are capable of generating stress to the resin cement layer .
the direct light - activation and the low viscosity version were important to provide higher dc for the dual - polymerizing resin cements .
the dc of resin cements was higher when the materials were light - cured and when the low - viscosity versions were used than when self - curing mode and the high - viscosity resin cements were tested , respectively ( p<.05 ) .
three - way repeated measure analysis of variance ( anova ) ( curing mode , viscosities and evaluation time ) was performed and tukey s post - hoc test was used to detect pair wise differences among experimental groups .
