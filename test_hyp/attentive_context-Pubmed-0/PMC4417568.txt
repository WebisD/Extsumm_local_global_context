this study is the first to demonstrate that ( 1 ) the absence of fcriib does not affect the susceptibility of mice to a primary infection with the intracellular category a mucosal pathogen f. tularensis ; ( 2 ) that in the absence of fcriib , both humoral and cellular immunity are enhanced following immunization with the inactivated vaccine ift ; ( 3 ) that the level of ag - specific iga produced in response to vaccination can be impacted by the presence / absence of fcriib ; ( 4 ) that the enhanced immune responses observed ( ft - specific iga and ifn- production ) following ift - immunization correlate with increased protection of fcriib ko versus wt mice after lethal mucosal challenge with ft lvs . thus , these studies further expand our knowledge regarding the role of fcriib plays in the immune response to infection , while also providing further impetus for developing vaccines geared toward modulating the inhibitory activities of this receptor .
fc gamma receptor iib ( fcriib ) , which is expressed on b cells , as well as other antigen ( ag ) presenting cells ( apc ) , is the only fc gamma receptor ( fcr ) known to negatively regulate the immune response and play an important role in b - cell regulation and antibody ( ab ) production   .
