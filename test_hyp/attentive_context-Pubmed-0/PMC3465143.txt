it was observed that the transdermal permeation increased with increase in injury caused to the tissue . the higher current density ( 0.5 ma / cm ) increased the mtx flux tremendously , but the reversibility studies did not confirm its skin tolerance as the histological changes were not reversible in 48 h.
the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of current density on mtx permeation as well as to assess the skin injury caused by the above - mentioned physical enhancer by histological examination .
reversibility studies were conducted in vivo after 24 and 48 h of the application of iontophoresis . it was observed that recovery process had started in 24 h and almost total recovery of epidermal as well as dermal changes was found in 48 h with low current density dc iontophoresis , however with iontophoresis using 0.5 ma / cm current density , edema along with focal disruption of the epidermis persisted [ figure 4 ] .
the partial denudation of the epidermis with left over basal layer showed a rapid recovery as compared to areas with loss of basal layers as seen with 0.5 ma / cm current density iontophoresis .
