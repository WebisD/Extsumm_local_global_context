, the author discusses the variegated applications of molecular typing in today 's public health laboratories by presenting three case studies to help illustrate preventive management strategies relying on subtyping .
for the public health laboratory system in austria ( total population 8.3 million ) , the implementation of these new methods has effectuated a complete restructuring , with a switch from geographic allocation of tasks ( six laboratories each serving a certain geographic area ) to allocating special tasks to the only two remaining laboratories , each offering specialized service to all of the country . in this special article
, dna fingerprinting thchniques have become an indispensable tool in the everyday work of public health laboratories ; restriction enzymes were the key to this innovation .
it also supports studies to trace - back the source of an outbreak and to identify new risk factors as the strains can be linked more accurately to epidemiological and clinical data .
molecular typing of pathogens causing diseases complements the traditional epidemiological surveillance by providing appropriate discriminatory analyses to foster rapid and early detection of dispersed clusters or outbreaks , and for detection and investigation of transmission chains .
these examples originate from the daily routine work of the austrian agency for health and food safety ( ages ) .
