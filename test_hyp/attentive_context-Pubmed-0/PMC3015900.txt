in addition , a more favorable cellular and humoral immunological response has been observed in laparoscopic colorectal resection in terms of a lower level of circulating il-6 and tnf-. theoretically , with the lower degree of trauma induced by notes , a lower peri - operative proinflammatory response would be expected . in the current study , we aimed at analyzing the systemic inflammatory responses associated with transvaginal cholecystectomy in a porcine model .
the mean preoperative il-6 was 59.54 pg / ml for the control group ( c ) , 63.5 pg / ml for the laparoscopic group ( l ) , and 50.47 for the notes group ( n ) ( p=0.897 ) .
two pigs underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( l ) , and 6 pigs underwent notes transvaginal cholecystectomy with a single - channel endoscope and esd instruments ( n ) . in all 6 pigs in the treatment group , satisfactory control of the cystic complex was achieved , and no major intraoperative complications occurred .
but there was a significant increase in postoperative day 1 tnf- level in the laparoscopic group compared with the control and notes groups : 63.53 pg / ml ( c ) , 93.83 pg / ml ( l ) , and 50.59 pg / ml ( n ) ( p=0.049 ) .
