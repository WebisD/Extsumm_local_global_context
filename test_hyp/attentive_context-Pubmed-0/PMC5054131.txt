our lab now routinely applies this software to the qa of our microarray experiments ( 6 ) .
we report an r function ( www.rproject.org ) named microarray outlier filter ( mof ) , which was designed to screen outliers at the whole array level by using the arrays from the current experiment and those from the historical archive that meet defined criteria .
other methods monitor an individual array as a whole during the experimental process using classification methods ( 4 ) or by comparison of the statistical features of an array with the same statistical features based on historical data ( 5 ) . here
dna microarray analysis has gained widespread application and a wide variety of methods have been developed to analyze the large and complex datasets generated by this technology ( 1 ) . due to the sheer volume of data , and the high number of sources of potential error , quality control and quality assurance
in essence , mof examines the consistency of arrays in a large scale experiment ( multiple arrays ) .
since error may be the result of many factors at multiple steps , a number of qc / qa measures have been proposed to monitor specific sources of error .
