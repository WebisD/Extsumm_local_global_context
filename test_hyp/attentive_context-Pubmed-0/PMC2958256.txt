night asthma is more closely associated with airway inflammation , which verifies what we had expected .
although many different surrogate variables representing airway inflammation  such as bronchial responsiveness , low level of lung function , signs of airway obstruction ( low fev1/fvc ratio ) , positive skin prick test , high eosinophilic cell count , and many daily asthma symptoms  were included in the analysis of this large uniform cohort of persons with asthma , the study showed great diversity .
.001 ) , smoking (  .098 , p < .05 ) , atopy ( .16 , p < .001 ) , sex ( .18 , p < .001 ) , and asthma treatment (  .17 , p < .01 ) were found to be of significant consequence for development of eia .
asthmatic subjects with persistent exercise symptoms had lower lung function than those without symptoms ( 88% versus 94% , p < .001 ) , and treatment with inhaled steroid was more frequently used among those with persistent exercise symptoms ( 41% versus 17% , p < .001 ) . including all variables in a multivariate analysis concerning nighttime awakenings showed that logrdr was eliminated as well ; whereas frequency of shortness of breath during daytime (  0.263 , p < .001 ) , coughing (  0.243 , p < .001 ) , and eia (  0.102 , p = .066 ) were of significant consequence
