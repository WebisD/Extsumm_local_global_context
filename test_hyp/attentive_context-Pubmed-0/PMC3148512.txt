we used the lateral decubitus position during stereotactic vab combined with true lateral mammography on 15 patients .
although this report has simply introduced a diagnostic procedure , the usefulness of lateral decubitus positioning for stereotactic vab with true lateral mammography could be verified if a comparison between stereotactic vab and open biopsy or ultrasound - guided vab with a long term follow - up result was added .
our report has limitations such as the small number of cases with a short term follow - up and the absence of a comparison between stereotactic vab and other diagnostic procedures . according to several studies , 6 - 27% of benign breast lesions remain after a vab procedure , and it is difficult to distinguish between a post - procedural scar and residual lesion within 6 months . therefore , long term follow - up is necessary to evaluate for a residual breast lesion .
between january and june 2010 , we performed stereotactic directional vab on 15 patients at the breast cancer center of pusan national university hospital . in all cases
microcalcifications were observed in 12 ( 80.0% ) of the 15 cases , and the remaining three cases ( 20.0% ) showed non - palpable breast masses .
