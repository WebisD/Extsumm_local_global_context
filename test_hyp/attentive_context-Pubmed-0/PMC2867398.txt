previous experimental work on nucleosides and nucleotides has classified the behavior of individual torsion angles . structures of modified and unmodified nucleosides / nucleotides have been interrogated by one - dimensional ( 1d ) h nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and steady - state 1d h nuclear overhauser effect ( noe ) difference spectroscopy ( ssnoe ) . in this work ,
due to limitations of computer power , small model systems were used to parametrize the glycosidic dihedral angle in the amber94 force field.(2 ) in this article , the glycosidic dihedral angle ,  , of ribonucleic acids is reparameterized by extending the quantum mechanical ( qm ) fitting protocol , and new parameters are used in a revised force field , amber99. structural and thermodynamic results are extracted from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using amber99(33 ) and amber99 force fields .
transient 1d h noe spectroscopy(51 ) and sugar proton coupling constants extracted from 1d h nmr spectra for cytidine ( c ) and uridine ( u ) are used to quantitatively deduce the preferred conformations of the glycosidic dihedral angle and the sugar pucker , respectively .
understanding the physical interactions governing the structure and dynamics of ribonucleosides should improve the accuracy of simulations of ribonucleic acid ( rna ) molecules .
