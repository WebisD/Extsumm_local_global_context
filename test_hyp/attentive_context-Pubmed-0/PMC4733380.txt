we present a young man who had multiple complex spinal surgeries for resection of innumerable metastatic ependymoma lesions .
temporary external ventricular drainage for refractory thoracolumbar cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) leak is not reported in the literature .
as a last resort , we decided to place an external ventricular catheter for proximal controlled csf drainage with great success .
the 32-year - old man had a history of spinal myxopapillary ependymoma world health organization ( who ) grade i with local metastatic spinal disease . the patient first presented in 2005 with a 1-year history of severe low back pain . he was found to have an intradural lesion , and subsequently had a t12l3 laminectomy for resection of the tumor .
lumbar drains have been utilized in the case of persistent cervical csf leaks.6 we feel that a lumbar drain in our particular case would not have been best suited for the patient we presented .
although the placement of external ventricular drains comes with associated risks , if they are placed safely after a preprocedure computed tomography scan is done , their usage can be a viable option for temporary proximal csf diversion for refractory thoracolumbar csf leaks .
