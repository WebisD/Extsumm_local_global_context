the gamut of experimental approaches and simplistic / inaccurate assumptions highlight the need for continued research in ascertaining pdl properties under various and well - defined loading conditions , both clinical and experimental .
a better understanding of the pdl 's biomechanical behavior under physiologic and traumatic loading conditions might enhance the understanding of its biologic reaction in health and disease     . by providing a greater insight into human dental tissue response
these inconsistent properties underlying the pdl knowledge base are due , in part , to difficulties in examining this thin tissue and variations in experimentation approaches .
determining stress levels in different areas of the pdl , which are the most important and least understood stress - strain levels in orthodontic biomechanics , may offer the best means of correlating the application of force on a tooth with the tooth 's response   .  
it was shown that there were significant variations , some on the order of six orders of magnitude , of the elastic constants and mechanical properties of the pdl .  
the objective of this paper is to highlight and discuss the discrepancies that exist in published literature regarding experimentally determined mechanical properties of the pdl .
