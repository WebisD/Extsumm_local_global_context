thus , in light of the monocyte - independent origin of macrophages , other aspects of macrophage biology need reassessment , including macrophages heterogeneity , the role of environment in the tissue - specific specialization , and macrophage polarization into different functional phenotypes during inflammation . in this review
innate immunity is the first line of defense of the body , present throughout evolution from lower ( invertebrate ) to more complex organisms ( vertebrate ) ( 1 ) . in order to rapidly protect
given the important role of macrophages in acute and chronic inflammation and in other severe diseases ( artherosclerosis , neurodegeneration and cancer ) , it is not surprising the growing interest for their proprieties and for their potential clinical applications . in a recent review , martinez and gordon address the issue of translating the new knowledge of macrophage biology into clinical practice ( 75 ) .
moreover they indicate new application areas that are likely to develop in the near future , thanks to our new understanding of macrophage biology , including cell therapy , diagnosis and prognosis .
they play a pivotal role in the immune response to pathogens , by generating and then resolving the inflammatory reaction .
