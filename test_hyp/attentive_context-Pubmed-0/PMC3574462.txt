we report three patients with huntington 's disease , who showed good response to treatment with low dose lithium .
this report signifies the use of lithium as a neuroprotective agent . it may be beneficial to explore the possibility of use of other psychotropic drugs in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders
huntington 's disease ( hd ) is an autosomal dominant , progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea , subcortical dementia and psychiatric symptoms .
one of the treatment options is the use of drugs with neuroprotective potential , like lithium .
inhibition of this enzyme appears to have a neuroprotector effect in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and huntington 's disease .
in this report , we have described the use of lithium to prevent the progression of the huntington 's disease .
though rating of the movements was not done , there appears be some benefit in prescribing lithium to patients with huntington 's disease for slowing the progression of chorea and preventing mood swings .
the therapeutic strategies for hd are diverse , ranging from the classical drug therapies to the modern molecular strategies .
in these patients , lithium was started in order to alleviate the distress caused by the choreic movements and mood swings .
