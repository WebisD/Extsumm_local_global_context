the aim of this study was to determine and compare the patients reactivity to lst in three forms of cl , including common plaque type [ figure 1 ] , lupoid type [ figure 2 ] , and sporotrichoid type [ figure 3 ] .
lst was positive in 27.3% , negative in 72.7% , and none of the patients had a strongly positive reaction ( p < 0.05 ) .
this was a descriptive cross - sectional study performed in skin disease and leishmaniasis research centre , isfahan , iran .
the lst or montenegro test is an important tool for the diagnosis and epidemiological surveys of cl . because of the high sensitivity of lst in cl
it can be suggested that lupoid and sporotrichoid types of cl are parts of a continuous spectrum of the disease with an enhanced cellular immunity in lupoid form and a decreased state in sporotrichoid type .
the results of our study showed that most of the positive lst results belong to plaque and lupoid groups , the majority of strongly positives belong to lupoid , and the most of negative lst results were related to sporotrichoid type , the negativity of leishmanin test in some patients with plaque and lupoid types can be explained by the sensitivity of the test used which is 88% according to our results .
