thus , our objective was to evaluate the influence of gelator ( type and concentration ) , type of vegetable oil , stirring speed , and temperature preparation on the physical properties of obtained organogels .
also the first gelator tends to form needle shaped network structures with better intermolecular forces according to their hamaker constant and xrd analysis .
hence , since the study of organogels is very complex , it must include structural analysis and rheological and thermal behaviors in order to have a clear understanding on how preparation parameters are affecting the final product .
finally , it is important to point out that most of the influence of the stirring speed conditions is apparently related to the oils higher mufa and low pufa contents .
monoglycerides are known to be good initiators of fat crystallization and the matching in saturation and carbon chain length of both the gelator fatty acids and the oil phase are important in the particular lipid - lipid interactions . for the hamaker
thermal parameters could be helpful to explain this behavior , because they are associated with the molecules polarity and the energy of the molecular interactions that are established with the crystal structure of gelators in their neat and organogel states .
