in the course of the years , n - glycan patterns of several snail species have been presented   . methylated mannose and galactose residues were found to be frequent constituents . in the present study we determine the main o - glycan structures in snails and characterize a common core - trisaccharide .
we enlarge the current knowledge on glycosylation abilities of lower animals by presenting the first o - glycan analysis of snails , representatives of the mollusk phylum .
are similarly involved in recognition processes as they are in all other species , but especially the significance of the high degree of methylation of hexoses of n- as well as of o - glycans is waiting for elucidation . here
o - glycans have been found to play an important role in protein stability and tertiary structure , stabilize protein conformation , modulate the activity of enzymes ( e.g. by reversible attachment of o - linked glcnac to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins ) and signaling molecules , are essential for a number of recognition processes and are sorting determinants guiding the modified protein in the cell from the place of biosynthesis to its target location   .
during the last decades our knowledge on glycosylation processes - structure of the glycans and the corresponding biochemical pathways including the responsible enzymes - increased enormously , especially for glycans of mammalian origin .
