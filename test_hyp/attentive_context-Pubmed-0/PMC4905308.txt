bridging integrator-1 breast cancer 1 and 2 cyclin - dependent kinase cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor human homolog of double minute 2 poly(adp - ribosyl)ation poly(adpribose ) polymerase 1 retinoblastoma 1 protein
the discovery of gleevec ( sti-571 ) , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , was a milestone achievement in clinical oncology and this inhibitor has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in philadelphia chromosome - positive ( ph ) chronic myeloid leukemia . since then , mechanism - based approaches have been used to specifically target various kinases and/or downstream oncogenic pathways that are critically involved in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis . however , in addition to this approach , a more recent and novel use of small - molecule inhibitors has emerged as a promising endeavor in the field of cancer chemotherapy . here , we briefly review the mechanistic basis of restoration of a tumor suppressor and its potential complications for cancer therapy .
chemotherapy and radiotherapy are conventional treatments for eradicating tumors , but cancer often develops therapeutic resistance over time . given that many tumor suppressors are proapoptotic in response to dna damaging agents , it would be clinically pertinent to increase the chemo- and radiosensitivities of cancer by combining standard treatments with agents that can restore the activity of silenced tumor suppressors , provided they are not mutated or deleted , in human malignancies .
