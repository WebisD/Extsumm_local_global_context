therefore , we supposed that the plasma amino acid levels in lactating dam were 
 influenced by not only food intake , but also metabolic change . in the present study , we showed that imbalance of amino acid profiles strongly reflects the 
 metabolic changes occurring in vivo and that such data would be applicable 
 to various fields , such as diagnosis , treatment with infusion to patient , nutrition for the 
 pregnant women and production of artificial milk .
presentation of the amino acid profiles in a 2-dimensional circular plane , using the levels 
 of amino acids during diestrus or proestrus as controls , demonstrated that the profiles 
 changed during pregnancy and lactation in dams , but not during the estrous cycle . in 
 addition , 3-dimensional pca analysis revealed a different distribution of plasma amino acid 
 levels among reproductive stages or sex , especially in late pregnancy and early lactation in 
 dams .
however , this correlation between food 
 intake and plasma amino acid levels did not apply to pregnant rats , since main change in 
 amino acid level in pregnant rats was decrease , but not increase , nevertheless , food intake 
 increased . in lactating dam , however , some amino acids concomitant with food intake 
 increased in the present study also . but , the rises of bcaa were not recognized in lactating 
 dam .
