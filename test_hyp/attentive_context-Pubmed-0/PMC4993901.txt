herein we present 4 cases assessing the technical feasibility , safety , and treatment outcomes of rfa employed at the time of ercp to treat ampullary lesions with intraductal extension .
catheter - based radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) delivered during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) has recently emerged as a possible therapeutic option within the bile duct 1

recently , the use of rfa at the ampulla and within the distal bile duct has been described 7 
 8 .
prospective studies are necessary to evaluate these issues and determine the long - term effectiveness of this modality .   in summary , catheter - based rfa after endoscopic resection of ampullary lesions that extend up the bile duct is technically feasible .
intrabiliary extension of neoplasm remains an important challenge in the endoscopic eradication of complex ampullary lesions 5 
 6 , and rfa may represent a viable treatment adjunct for this problem .
although endoscopic ampullectomy is the preferred treatment for noninvasive ampullary lesions with a success rate reported as high as 92  % 10 , biliary extension of neoplasm represents a significant obstacle to endoscopic eradication .
three patients ( 75  % ) had a history of familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) .
