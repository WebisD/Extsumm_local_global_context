a 60-year - old asian woman , weighing 48 kg with a height of 147 cm , was scheduled for laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach due to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) .
relapsing polychondritis is a disorder that has a variety of clinical manifestations and is considered an autoimmune disease resulting in cartilage breakdown . the disorder is usually presented with episodes of erythema , pain , and swelling of the ears , nose , and joints .
thus , we present that thoracic epidural analgesia can be safely utilized as an anesthetic technique for patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery with airway difficulties , reduced pulmonary function , or weak respiratory muscles due to neuromuscular disease .
we were able to put a patient with severe relapsing polychondritis for wedge resection of stomach under thoracic epidural analgesia and found no specific complications as a result thereof .
laryngotracheal symptoms are present in approximately 25% of the patients in the initial course of the disease , however , airway symptoms eventually occur in 50% of all patients with relapsing polychondritis .
however , there was a distinct difference in the severity of disease between this case and tanaka 's case , as the patient in tanaka 's case had only mild dyspnea on exertion and no tracheal stenosis on the ct scan .
