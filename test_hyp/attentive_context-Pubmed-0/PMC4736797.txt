these findings demonstrated that high glucose - induced podocyte f - actin rearrangement was associated with the activation of fyn / rock signaling pathway and the axis - mediated phosphorylation of paxillin .
, we sought further confirmation that the reorganization of the f - actin cytoskeleton , along with paxillin phosphorylation and increased cell motility , is a consequence of fyn / rock signaling pathway activation in high glucose - induced podocyte injury , represented by alterations to synaptopodin , desmin , and vimentin expression .
we found that exposure of podocytes to high glucose led to a rearrangement of the filamentous actin ( f - actin ) , accompanied by paxillin phosphorylation and increased cell motility .
the activation of rock in the kidney has been confirmed in models of diabetes both in vitro and in vivo   , whereas inhibition of rock ameliorated the structural changes in the diabetic kidney together with a modest antiproteinuric effect . in this study , we aimed to reveal the role of the fyn / rock signaling pathway in podocyte injury that was induced by high glucose and its interactions with paxillin .
these observations shed light on one possible mechanism responsible for podocyte dysfunction in diabetes mellitus and may facilitate the development of novel strategies for treating diabetic nephropathy by targeting cytoskeletal rearrangement in podocytes .
