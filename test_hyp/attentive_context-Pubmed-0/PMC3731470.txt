 to evaluate neuroradiological features of mps , including brain abnormal signal intensity and atrophy . 
the evaluation of these imaging findings is useful for suggesting and supporting mps as a possible diagnosis , usually obtained by laboratory analysis , for monitoring the chronic and progressive course of the disease , for surgical and medical planning and for assessing the impact of therapy .
skeletal x - ray and mri may show specific features in mps patients , although it is not possible to accurately differentiate between mps types based on skeletal and neurological characteristics .
the mucopolysaccharidoses ( mps ) are a group of heritable lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficiency in glycosaminoglycan ( gag)-degrading enzymes .
transmission occurs in an autosomal recessive fashion , except for mps ii , which is x - linked .
seven distinct clinical types of mps have been identified and described in the literature , caused by 11 different enzymatic deficiencies . even if each type of mps presents a rare incidence ,
the development of new therapies  represented by enzyme replacement therapies , substrate inhibition therapy and haematopoietic cell transplantation  have changed the treatment of these patients , with a fundamental shift in the approach from symptomatic management to therapeutic intervention ; in many cases , the introduction of these new therapies has significantly improved the duration and quality of life for patients   . in patients with mps ,
