we used budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cellular models of specific replication stress and sister chromatid cohesion defects to investigate a possible crosstalk between recombination - mediated ddt and chromatin structure / cohesion .
we propose that aberrant ddt associated with compromised error - free ts and fork rearrangements is a potential underlying common source of lesions in a number of replication disorders .
the results shed light on how highly conserved replication - associated pathways crosstalk to each other and contribute to normal replication fork and chromatin structure , providing mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of human disorders caused by replication dysfunctions .
faithful dna replication is crucial for genomic maintenance . when replication is perturbed , cells activate stress response networks that connect the detection of replication - blocking lesions with dna damage tolerance ( ddt ) and repair pathways , chromatin modifications , cell - cycle control , and various other changes in cell physiology , often collectively referred to as the dna damage response ( ddr ) ( jackson and bartek , 2009 ) . failures in these processes
our results indicate that both replicative helicase - coupled re - priming and sister chromatid cohesion are important to facilitate error - free ddt by ts , but they do so via different mechanisms .
