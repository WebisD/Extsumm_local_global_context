the patient was a 25-year - old , right - handed woman who presented two months after the sudden onset of lower extremity paresthesias and sensory loss that extended into the abdomen and lower chest and one episode of urinary urgency and subsequent incontinence .
this patient , presenting with transient rls due to an acute , inflammatory exacerbation of her multiple sclerosis , further supports the notion that the pathophysiology of rls in multiple sclerosis is related to autoimmune inflammatory demyelination .
restless legs syndrome is a movement disorder characterized by distressing urge to move the legs ( akathisia ) associated with discomfort and that is brought on by rest , relieved by movement or walking , and become worse at night or in the evening .  
the observation that rls is associated with spinal cord plaques would also suggest a relationship to the inflammatory and demyelinating component of disease .  
she had a subsequent similar episode of left hemiparesis and hemisensory deficit two months after that , confirming a diagnosis of clinically definite multiple sclerosis .
one year after her initial presentation , she developed a sudden onset of discomfort in her legs associated with an urge to move that was worse at night and impaired sleep .
