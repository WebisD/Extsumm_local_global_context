has reviewed prospective studies investigating the possible protective effects of the dietary intake of n-3 pufa on prostate cancer development.16 fasano et al also has reviewed a lot of in vivo and in vitro experimental studies providing strong indications of the anti - tumor action of n-3 pufa against lung cancer.17 the purpose of this review is to discuss the potential role of n-3 pufa in gastrointestinal ( gi ) cancer development .
especially , recent studies suggest that endogenous n-3 pufa delay the progression of colon and stomach cancer and elevating n-3 pufa may be an important strategy to delay / prevent gastrointestinal cancer in high - risk patients via various mechanisms mediating cancer prevention by n-3 pufa ( fig .
men aged 50 and women aged 55.56 we expect that new findings in combination consumption of n-3 pufa with other nutrients will provide new approaches to public health implications with regard to prevention of gi cancer through dietary and lifestyle interventions .
the contribution to human health of the specific fatty acid ( fa ) composition of the diet has received considerable attention in the literature .
gi cancer incidence and mortality are increasing in the eastern world and a high n-6 to n-3 pufa ratio in the western style diet may be a contributing factor .
