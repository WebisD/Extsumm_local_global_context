even when a patient 's icp is within the normal range , the possibility of iih should always be considered in a patient with typical clinical features of iih , such as , papilledema , a headache , pulsatile tinnitus , and blind spot enlargement by visual field testing .
subsequently , green et al . , reported the case of an 18-year - old woman iih patient with a normal icp , and introduced the term  normal pressure iih  to describe this variant of iih .
we recommended a second lumbar puncture to both of our patients , but our adult patient refused , and repeat lumbar puncture in the 15-year - old girl confirmed a normal icp .
we had considered continuous icp monitoring in both cases , but we decided to start treatment first because they complained of a headache and showed definite bilateral disc swelling with related visual field defects .
johnston et al . , reported a series of atypical iih patients , one of which was a 13-year - old boy whose disc edema rapidly resolved after lumboperitoneal shunt insertion even though his initial csf pressure was normal .
papilledema is a warning sign of an elevated icp and ophthalmologists should be alert when a patient has papilledema without any symptoms .
