the 
 combination of acupuncture - like tens and acupoints is a treatment choice for acute pain in 
 the hand region .
the latency of the 
 pain threshold and its intensity in healthy subjects subjected to cold - induced pain was 
 measured .
subjects were allocated to three groups : the 1  cm electrode group , 
 the 15  cm electrode group , and the placebo group .
a acupuncture - like tens with electrodes with an area of 1  cm showed effects on 
 the pain threshold latency during application , while acupuncture - like tens with 
 15  cm electrodes showed effects after tens application .
* significant difference between the 15  cm group and placebo group the effect size ( cohen s d ) with 1  cm electrodes was d = 0.98 pain and of 
 15  cm was d = 0.88 for the pain threshold latency time and respectively d = 
 0.96 and d = 0.91 post - treatment pain threshold latency time .
the placebo group 
 showed no significant changes in any experimental phase ( table 1table 1.the latency threshold ( seconds ) of pain in the different periods of acupuncture
