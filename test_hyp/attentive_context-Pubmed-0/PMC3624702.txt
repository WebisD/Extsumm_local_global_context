a group in the department of pathology at the university of pittsburgh medical center developed a data management interface to help solve this problem successfully interfacing a waters 2795 lc - ms / ms to a sunquest lis .
we describe here the implementation of the same data management interface using the same lis , but a different mass spectrometer that is in use in our laboratory and we extend their work by describing the pre - processor code that was required to convert the data output from the mass spectrometer into a format accepted by the lis .
an example of such complex equipment is a liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) system , which , in recent years has become a frequent addition to clinical laboratories for a variety of applications including testing for drugs of abuse , therapeutic drug monitoring and steroid analysis.  such devices offer high potential sample throughput , but , as they are not currently accompanied by vendor - supplied interfaces to enable them to be connected to a laboratory information system ( lis ) , they also impose a potentially burdensome requirement for manual data transfer with the concomitant risk of transcription errors . to the authors knowledge ,
