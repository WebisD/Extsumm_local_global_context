we describe a case of a female bd patient with aseptic tricuspid valve ( tv ) endocarditis presenting as ts .
the frequency of cardiovascular involvement is estimated to be 4 - 46%.1)2 ) common vascular manifestations are thrombophlebitis and arteritis , which occur in as many as one - third of the patients.3 ) aseptic endocarditis is a rare manifestation of bd and is mostly found in the form of intracardiac thrombus or endomyocardial fibrosis.3)4 ) nonrheumatic tricuspid valve stenosis ( ts ) is extremely rare , and to our knowledge , it has never been reported in the english literature in patients with bd .
a 39-year - old female was admitted to kyungpook national university hospital with a 3-month history of dyspnea on exertion and abdominal distension .
behet 's disease ( bd ) is characterized by recurrent aphthous stomatitis , genital ulcers , and various skin lesions .
as in this case , the cardiac lesions in bd might progress insidiously in the absence of concurrent signs or symptoms of bd , or they were even diagnosed at autopsy.10)11 ) therefore , it might be difficult to detect endocarditis in the early stage .
transesophageal echocardiography showed severe ts with an ill - margined echogenic mass , and a mild to moderate amount of pericardial effusion ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .
