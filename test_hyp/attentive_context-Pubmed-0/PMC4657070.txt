this study is , to our knowledge , the first to show the predictive value of baseline serum levels of adiponectin , vitamin d , and afp for the treatment response of chc in children .
for adiponectin it was found that at a cutoff value of > 8.04  ng / ml , it can predict treatment response by 77.8% sensitivity , 92.9% specificity , 96.6% ppv , 61.9% npv , and 82.3% accuracy , while afp and hcv - rna at cutoff values < 3.265  ng / ml and < 235,384  iu / ml , respectively , can predict treatment response with a sensitivity of 83.3% and 83.3% , specificity of 85.7% and 78.6% , ppv of 93.75% and 90.9% , npv of 66.7% and 64.7% , and accuracy of 82.36% and 79.38% , respectively .
lastly , vitamin d was found to be higher in the treatment responders ( 77.2  46.6  ng / ml ) than nonresponders ( 57.2  53.9  ng / ml ) , with borderline significance , p = 0.076 .
adiponectin was found to be significantly negatively correlated with both afp ( r = 0.29 and p = 0.043 ) and level of viremia ( r = 0.39 and p = 0.005 ) , with no significant correlation with other studied parameters .
