both gonadal and adrenal testosterone can be converted into estrogens ( c18 steroids ) by the p 450 aromatase , encoded by cyp 19 , which is present in many peripheral tissues , including bone .
bone cells express androgen receptor ( ar ) as well as estrogen receptor- ( er ) and  ( er ) .
it would seem therefore that intact ar function is required for the suppressive effects of androgens on the osteoclastogenesis supporting activity of osteoblasts , but not osteoclasts . in conclusion , both human and animal experiments suggest that testosterone has a dual mode of action on different bone surfaces .
therefore , androgen action on male bone may be explained by ar activation or , alternatively , activation of er and  ( figure 1 ) .
the importance of estrogen receptor alpha activation as well as of aromatization of androgens into estrogens was highlighted by a number of cases of men suffering from an inactivating mutation in the estrogen receptor alpha or in the aromatase enzyme   .  

both ar and er are involved in male skeletal growth and maintenance , supporting a dual mode of action for testosterone , either directly on the ar or indirectly on the er through aromatization . in summary , both ar and
