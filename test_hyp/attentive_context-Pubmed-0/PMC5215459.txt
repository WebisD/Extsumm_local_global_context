this review summarizes evidence in this field of research attempting to reveal the relationship between parkinson therapy and pathological gambling , discusses the reasons why some patients react on them differently than others , what the relevant risk factors are and considers how impulsivity may contribute to the development of gambling symptoms .
pathological gambling is defined in the current classification system of the world health organization ( 1992 ) ( icd10 ) as an impulse control disorder ( icd ) which causes excessive , uncontrollable gambling despite financial losses and social problems , while the latest version of the diagnostic and statistical manual ( dsm5 ) of the american psychiatric association ( 2013 ) grouped pathological gambling together with substancerelated and addictive disorders and renamed it to gambling disorder . despite this aetiological debate , in parkinson 's patients
several genetic and neurofunctional findings suggest that individual differences in dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum and associated brain areas contribute to pathological gambling in parkinson 's disease , and indicate complex interactions between such risk factors . taken together ,
the aetiology of the development of pathological gambling in parkinson 's disease is still unclear , however , research suggests an association with dopamine replacement therapy , specifically with dopamine agonists ( voon et  al . , 2006 ;
