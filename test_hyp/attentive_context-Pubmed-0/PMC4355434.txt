the mean operative time was similar in the conventional and grasp and bite groups ( 35 minutes vs. 35 minutes , respectively ) .
, we demonstrate the easy resection technique for superficial bladder tumors that we have termed the " grasp and bite " turbt technique and compare it with conventional turbt .
from january to april 2012 , 16 patients were enrolled who had undergone conventional turbt . from january to april 2013 , the grasp and bite technique was applied to 19 patients with superficial bladder tumors .
the two groups had comparable demographic and intraoperative data , including patient age , tumor size , patient gender , multiplicity , tumor morphology , and tumor location ( table 1 ) .
group 1 patients were treated by use of the conventional turbt technique , and group 2 patients underwent the grasp and bite technique .
2 ) . there was no significant difference in recurrence rates between the conventional and grasp and bite turbt groups during the 14-month follow - up ( 43.8% vs. 31.6% , p=0.458 ) .
our study demonstrated that grasp and bite turbt is a safe and effective method for removing superficial bladder tumors .
