therefore , the n-3/n-6  fa ratio improved significantly from 0.38 to 0.58 ( ( epa + dha)/aa in the tg and pl fractions , with p < 0.01 ) ( figure 5 ) . linoleic acid ( la , 18  :  2 , n-6  fa ) and ala ( 18  :  3 , n-3  fa ) , which are precursors of the biologically fas , epa , and aa , were shown to increase significantly ( p < 0.01 ) in both the tg and the pl fractions of plasma , after mpl supplementation .
for example , the study of bruera et al . , in which fish oil was supplemented to patients in an advanced cancer stage , showed to cause multiple gastrointestinal problems with an even lower dose . besides the mpl - induced increase of the n-3/n-6  fa ratio in all study groups , significant differences on the ldl  and lysophosphatidylcholine ( lpc)increase between the groups of subjects were observed .
epa and dha increased significantly after mpl supplementation in both the tg and pl fractions of plasma , whereas the aa decreased significantly .
during this clinical trial we found that simulating a high fish consumption in subjects with a usually rather low fish consumption by supplying mpl improved the n-3/n-6  fa ratio significantly .
