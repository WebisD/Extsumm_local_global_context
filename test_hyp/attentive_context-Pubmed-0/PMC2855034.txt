ten lower legs ( five left and five right ) , amputated approximately 15  cm below the knee , from seven men and three women fresh frozen specimens were carefully examined in the department of pathology and experimental therapeutic unit of human anatomy and embryology in barcelona , spain .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to perform an anatomical study to determine the course of the superficial peroneal nerve in different positions of the foot and ankle to possibly explain and clarify this rather contradiction , and eventually to diminish future complication rates .
the standardized ankle movement from 10 plantar flexion and inversion to the 5 dorsiflexion resulted in an mean nerve movement of 3.6  mm to the lateral side ( sd 1.8 , range 1.387.68 ) . both displacements to the lateral side were significant ( p  <  0.01 ) ( table  1).table  1general specimen characteristics with superficial peroneal nerve movement ( mm ) from combined 10 plantar flexion and inversion to neutral and to 5 ankle dorsiflexionspecimenagegendersuperficial peroneal nerve movement ( mm ) from 10 plantar flexion and inversion toneutral5 dorsiflexionobserver 1observer 2observer 3averageobserver 1observer 2observer 3average1791.791.921.961.893.743.623.383.582831.641.571.681.631.892.091.811.933761.381.461.631.491.501.591.381.494710.951.000.990.981.951.911.751.875653.223.583.193.333.253.453.863.526812.492.462.372.443.623.553.333.507903.132.963.093.066.096.186.126.138722.042.322.332.233.273.253.023.189672.602.542.402.513.333.293.493.3710783.983.924.194.037.497.397.687.52median77average2.363.61sd0.921.97icc ( intraclass correlation coefficient)0.980.99one sample t  test ( p  <  0.05)<0.01<0.01 general specimen characteristics with superficial peroneal nerve movement ( mm ) from combined 10 plantar flexion and inversion to neutral and to 5 ankle dorsiflexion the inter - observer reliability coefficients ( icc ) for the measurement of nerve displacement for both ankle movements were 0.98 ( 95% ci ; 0.9530.998 ) and 0.99 ( 95% ci ; 0.9800.998 ) , respectively . with the ankle in the neutral position the superficial peroneal nerve or its terminal branches did not move while applying tension on the skin , flexion of the 4th toe or flexion of all toes .
