we describe a novel technique combining the use of bulk autograft with an iliac osteotomy which provides primary stability and optimises direct cancellous - cancellous bone contact and report mid - term results on 21 patients .
, our study has shown that this technique variation combining an iliac osteotomy with bulk autograft in cases of developmental hip dysplasia provides early stability and reliable graft incorporation , together with satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes in the medium term .
during the period 19982001 , 21 hips in 21 patients were managed with autologous bone graft in combination with an iliac osteotomy at our institution .
postoperative complications included transient neuropraxias in 3 patients , an episode of dislocation in one patient which was treated with closed reduction .
immediate postoperative radiographs showed a mean acetabular inclination angle of 43 ( range 2862 ) , and the average coverage of the component by graft was 40.2% ( range 2460% ) .
russotti and harris   defined proximal placement of the socket as 35  mm of vertical displacement , and according to these criteria six patients had proximal placement of the socket .  
the preoperative radiographic classification was crowe type i in 12 hips ( 57% ) , type ii in 4 hips , and type iii in 5 hips , and the mean sharp angle was 49.6 ( range 4260 ) .
