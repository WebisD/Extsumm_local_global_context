diagnosis and treatment of associated lesions ( especially those of meniscus and articular cartilage ) , shortening of hospitalization duration and postoperative rehabilitation , but also the lower rate of complications , can make arthroscopy assisted reduction and internal fixation the method of choice for the operative treatment of selected schatzker i  iii types of articular proximal tibial fractures .
the purpose of this article is to describe a new surgical method of arthroscopy assisted treatment of intraarticular proximal tibial fractures ( arif  arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation ) , analyzing its efficiency and safety on a series of patients .
we encountered a case of transitory edema of the calf , which lasted about three weeks , and a case of persistent articular effusion with flexion limitation .
the utilization of arthroscopy offers a good visualization of articular fracture reduction , allowing a stable fixation without the need of an extensive approach .
6a ) , but in one patient , due to the stability obtained by insertion of the bone substitute ( fig .
the results obtained with the arthroscopic method were excellent in 5 cases ( mean rasmussen score 27.60 points ) and just good in only 1 case ( score 23.75 ) .
