. the ultimate goal of the work presented here was to define criteria and to develop an algorithm that for a given set of protein structures would automatically identify structurally conserved regions and use them to create clustering results similar to those that would be obtained by manual inspection ( e.g. scop curators ) . in our novel approach , called stralcp ( structure alignment - based clustering of proteins ) , for a given set of protein structures , we generate and combine detailed structural information about automatically detected global and local similarities between protein pairs , identify similar regions that are conserved within the set of proteins , report these regions , and use them to cluster the proteins according to their similarities in such identified structural frames .
they introduced the sgm ( scaled gauss metric ) , which is a metric derived from knot theoretical ideas to cluster proteins according to their structural topologies .
it is important to keep in mind that a purely structure - based approach to clustering may result in two proteins that are identical in sequence being clustered separately if the two structures differ in conformation ; we observed that the stralcp algorithm is able to detect the structural differences between domains from the same scop family and cluster them separately .
