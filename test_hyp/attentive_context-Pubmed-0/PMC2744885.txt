we now report that the rac1 gtpase was involved synergistically with hbx in the migration of hbv - replicating cells .
interestingly , the activation of rac1 and hbv replication has been found to be significantly decreased in cells transfected with p - a mutant hbv genome .
findings in this report have provided an extension on the consequences of the rac1 activation by hbv replication , in terms of cell motility . to our knowledge , this is the first report to show the potential relationship between proline rich domain in hbx ( in the context of hbv replication ) and cell motility , and should shed new lights on the understanding of the mechanism of hcc development .
the motility of hepg2 cells expressing rac1 alone , and those expressing both rac1 and replicative hbv genome was then analysed by transwell assay , as indicated by the number of cells migrated to the lower side of the collagen - coated membrane ( see section 2 ) .
it has been reported that the hbx activates erks and pi-3k / akt pathways25 , and further activates matrix metalloproteinase-919 with a potential function of invasion and metastasis .
seven sets of constructs were used in this analysis : wild - type rac1 alone ; constitutively activated rac1 alone ; dominant negative rac1 alone ; wild - type rac1 and wild - type hbv genome ; wild - type rac1 and p - a mutant hbv genome ; wild - type hbv genome alone ; and p - a mutant hbv genome alone .
