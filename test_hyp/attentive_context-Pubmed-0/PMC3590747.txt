the ultimate aim of the present study is , therefore , to test the efficacy of abs nanohemostat formed by combination of a self - assembling pa molecule and ankaferd hemostat for controlling surgical bleeding due to renal injury during partial nephrectomy ( pn ) and to compare its hemostatic effects to the traditional surgical and ankaferd hemostat groups .
fibrosis was not different among the groups ( p > 0.05 ) , while inflammation was detected to be significantly different in g3 and g4 ( p = 0.04 ) .
a significant difference was detected between g1 and g2 , 3 , and 4 , while no difference was observed among the three groups ; g1 , g2 , and g3 ( table 1 ) . in g1 ,
the third step of our study was testing the in vivo hemostatic effects of abs nanohemostat in comparison with the traditional ankaferd in a previously established and published controlled surgical experimental trial in kidney tissue .
the first step of our research was the synthesis of the specific self - assembling peptide molecules capable of being a part of the combined abs nanohemostat compound .
erythrocyte aggregation , especially in glomerular field ( figure 7 ) , was confirmed to be significantly higher in g3 ( abs nanohemostat ) compared with the other groups ( p = 0.03 ) .
