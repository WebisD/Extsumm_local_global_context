third , the selection of the segmental artery from the aorta and the stable engagement of the catheter to perform 3dra are not always easy because of the relatively acute angle of the segmental artery run - off from the aorta . differently shaped catheters might be required for different levels of the segmental artery . in conclusion
however , only one - third of our patients had feeders with an upward oblique course , and the majority of patients had feeders with a transverse or downward course that possibly traveled along the dura between two adjacent nerve roots ( intersegmental ) .
the spider view ( contralateral - oblique - angled caudal view ) and the tunnel view ( bottom - up view ) are useful for distinguishing the proximal branching vessels of the intercostal artery , the dorsal muscular arteries , and the fistula from the radicular artery with its sharp medial turn from the segmental artery .
, 3dra provided additional information for evaluating the angioarchithecture of sdavfs including the number and course of feeders , and for choosing appropriate working angles to select feeders and achieve successful embolisation or surgical treatment .
the most suitable views were chosen to reveal the two most complex areas of the feeder angioarchitecture : ( 1 ) the level where the segmental artery branches into intercostal , radicular and dorsal muscular arteries , and ( 2 ) the level where the radicular artery makes a sharp medial turn into the intervertebral foramen .
