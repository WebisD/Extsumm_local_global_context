the purposes of this study were to measure the length of the central myelin , especially from root detach point to transitional zone and determine histological structures of central myelin of facial nerve .
our study shows the length of medial rez is mean 2.6 mm ( range of 1.6 - 3.5 mm ) and the rez is covered by glial sheath continued from glial limiting membrane of brain stem .
twenty brain stems were obtained from formalin embedded cadavers . the 12 men and 8 women of cadavers ranged in age from 32 to 78 years ( mean , 58 years ) . during the brain
special staining methods , such as pas and gfap , could be clearly distinguished the facial nerve into peripheral and central myelin . peripheral myelin was stained dark blue with pas staining and central myelin was stained dark brown with gfap ( fig .
, we cut the midline of brain stem into halves and slice them along the facial nerve .
we obtained 40 facial nerves but 17 facial nerves were put out of shape during preparation for histological study .
with the h&e staining , the shape of facial nerve was easily determined ( fig .
