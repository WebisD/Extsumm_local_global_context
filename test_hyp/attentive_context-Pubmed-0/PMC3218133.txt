there are no reported cases of a renal leiomyosarcoma invading the retroperitoneal colon and mimicking a submucosal lesion .
a renal leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasm of the kidney , accounting for approximately 1% of all malignant renal tumors , and has a poor prognosis   .
thus , we report this unusual , but interesting , case of recurrence of a rare renal leiomyosarcoma .
a 57-year - old woman visited our gastroenterology department complaining of diffuse lower abdominal discomfort .
she visited our clinic complaining of diffuse abdominal pain , and colonoscopy showed a submucosal tumor or an extrinsic mass involving the descending colon .
furthermore , it took several months to diagnose a recurrent renal leiomyosarcoma in the same patient because of the ambiguous , nonspecific symptoms .
as observed in this case , recurrence of a leiomyosarcoma in the retroperitoneum needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of submucosal tumors in the colon .
its symptoms , such as nonspecific abdominal discomfort , dull pain , and oliguria , are common in other conditions ; therefore , a renal leiomyosarcoma is difficult to diagnose preoperatively . in this case , the condition had been preoperatively misdiagnosed four years earlier as a renal cell carcinoma before it was diagnosed as a primary renal leiomyosarcoma .
