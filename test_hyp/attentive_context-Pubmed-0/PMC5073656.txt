, we report a case of bilateral gbs nf of the foot with a unique clinical presentation and describe the clinical characteristics of gbs nf based on a review of published cases .
streptococcus agalactiae , also known as group b streptococcus ( gbs ) , is a bacterium often isolated from vaginal or rectal swab of pregnant women and long recognized as the major cause of neonatal sepsis , meningitis , and infection in pregnant women .
a 43-year - old male with a history of type 1 diabetes presented with severe pain in both feet .
gbs is a minor pathogen of necrotizing fasciitis ( nf ) ; however , the incidence of gbs nf in nonpregnant adults with underlying disease has increased in recent years . here
although it is difficult to differentiate gbs nf and gbs cellulitis because the speed of evolution of gbs nf is slow , dermatologists must be aware of the characteristics of gbs nf and the possibility of appearance of secondary nf at remote sites with an approximate 1-week delay .
thus , hematologic dissemination of gbs is an early event in the development of secondary gbs nf , and it appears that the occurrence of secondary nf with a 1-week delay is due to the slow evolution of inflammation in remote fascia and subcutaneous tissue . including cases of bilateral gbs nf of an extremity , gbs was detected in blood culture in 50% ( 11 of 22 ) of gbs nf cases .
