we present a very interesting case of a rapidly progressive methicillin - sensitive staphylococcus aureus infection , for which empirical treatment with vancomycin and initial treatment with nafcillin did not stop further dissemination despite adequate mic , taking longer than usual to respond to adequate treatment .
a 64-year - old male patient with a past medical history of hypertension , hiatal hernia and osteoarthritis presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of acute worsening of his chronic lower back pain for two weeks and progressive weakness in lower extremities .
nafcillin is a well - established agent for serious systemic non methicillin - resistant s. aureus ( mrsa ) infections and has been reported as superior over vancomycin .
the use of head mri as a pre evaluation tool for ie - related urgent valve surgery is imperative , to investigate whether such preoperative findings affect postoperative outcomes .
all patients with s. aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) , since s. aureus bacteremia is associated with heart valve involvement in 25% of the cases .
the presence of characteristic cranial mri lesions may prompt early diagnosis of infective source and lead to the adequate management . beyond the mic , the time the drug level exceeds the mic , the phenotypic tolerance and the inoculum effects may be reasons why empirical treatment with vancomycin and initial treatment with nafcillin did not stop further dissemination , but , eventually , clearing the infection .
