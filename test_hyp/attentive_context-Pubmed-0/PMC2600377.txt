the increased amc resistance of e. coli isolates from blood observed in this study is of serious concern from clinical and epidemiologic standpoints because amc is the first - choice antimicrobial treatment for many invasive e. coli infections .
increased amc resistance coincided with growing amc consumption at the community level . in urinary infections ,
participating hospitals reported data on 9,090 cases of e. coli bacteremia during the study period , corresponding to the same number of patients ; 4,526 ( 49.8% ) were male patients and 4,564 ( 50.2% ) were female patients .
the most prevalent phenotypes included multidrug resistance to ciprofloxacin , cotrimoxazole , and gentamicin , which was detected in 73 nonsusceptible amc isolates ( 36.9% of multiresistant isolates and 6.4% of isolates overall ) , and resistance to ciprofloxacin , cotrimoxazole , and cefotaxime was detected in 55 isolates ( 27.8% of multiresistant isolates ; 4.9% of isolates overall ) .
previous treatment with amc is a risk factor for the development of amc resistance ( 10 ) .
amc resistance mechanisms ( -lactamase overproduction , ampc cephalosporinase hyperproduction , and inhibitor - resistant penicillinases ) ( 11 ) might be favored by strong amc consumption .
