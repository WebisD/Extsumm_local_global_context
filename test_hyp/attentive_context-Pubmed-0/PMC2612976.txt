a solitary schwannoma , though rare , should be considered 
 as a preoperative differential diagnosis of a unilateral slow- 
 growing orbital mass in an adult and prompt management 
 is warranted to prevent development of vision - threatening 
 complications .
extensive 
 literature search revealed only a few case reports of an orbital 
 schwannoma arising from the infraorbital nerve.4 - 10 our 
 patient presented with the tumor in this uncommon location . 

a 35-year - old female presented with a painless , slowly growing 
 mass in the right inferior orbit for the past four years .
a provisional diagnosis of orbital dermoid was made and 
 the patient was taken up for an excision biopsy .
orbital schwannoma arising from the infraorbital nerve 
 is rare and clinical diagnosis is often difficult .
highly cellular 
 tumors have greater chance of recurrence and malignant 
 transformation . therefore an early treatment is indicated 
 to avoid the complications related to progressive growth of 
 the tumor . in our patient , we were successful in achieving 
 the above objectives with timely and complete excision of 
 the tumor .
. a variable combination 
 of signs and symptoms may be present due to the variable 
 origin and location of the tumor in the orbit.2 displacement 
 of the globe is related to the site of the tumor mass .
