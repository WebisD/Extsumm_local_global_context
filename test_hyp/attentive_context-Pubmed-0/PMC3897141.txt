our study provides the strongest evidence that association of mutation of fgfr1 , fgfr2 with syndromic as well as non - syndromic craniosynostosis does not exist in indian population as seen in western population .
the aim is to identify association of mutation of fgfr1 , fgfr2 genes with syndromic as well as non - syndromic craniosynostosis in indian population .
fgfr1 mutation ( pro252arg ) was seen in 1 ( 2.4% ) case of non - syndromic craniosynostosis while no association of mutation with either fgfr1 or fgfr2 mutation was noted in syndromic cases .
the aim is to identify association of mutation of fgfr1 , fgfr2 genes with syndromic as well as non - syndromic craniosynostosis in indian population .
diagnosed cases of syndromic and non - syndromic craniosynostosis patients between 6 months and 12 years of age either pre - operative or postoperative were included in the study .
the aim is to identify association of mutation of fgfr1 , fgfr2 genes with syndromic as well as non - syndromic craniosynostosis in indian population .
phenotypically the most common non - syndromic craniosynostosis was scaphocephaly ( 19 , 57.7% ) followed by plagiocephaly in 14 ( 42.3% ) .
