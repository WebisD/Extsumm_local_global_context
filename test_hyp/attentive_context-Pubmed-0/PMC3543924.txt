furthermore , the recent recommendation from the international association of diabetes and pregnancy study group has lowered the diagnostic threshold of gdm and is expected to increase the incidence of gdm .
in addition , we hope that personalized genomic medicine could be available using the advances in the genetics of gdm and t2 dm .
the gwa study of gdm enabled us to investigate the common genetic risk factors of gdm , and it revealed that gdm and t2 dm share similar genetic backgrounds , at least in part ( fig .
gdm women are at increased risk of developing t2 dm and have familial clustering of t2 dm . a common pathophysiology that is shared by gdm and t2 dm is impaired compensatory increase in insulin secretion to overcome the increased insulin resistance .
gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) is defined as abnormal glucose tolerance that is first identified or diagnosed during pregnancy .
women with a previous history of gdm are at increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) .
the incidence of gdm is expected to rise , as it will parallel the increasing rate of obesity and t2 dm .
