we recommend that ultrasound be performed from the onset of puberty in all boys with classic cah to avoid the risk of infertility .
from june 2009 to january 2015 , 79 male patients had been diagnosed as cah and screened for testicular evaluation in our institute , and only 15 patients had tarts in this study .
this situation prompted us to investigate the sonographic features of tarts during puberty , evaluating patients no older than 18 years .
, few reports have described the imaging characteristics of tarts in puberty and adolescent ; the present study is the first to evaluate the sonographic features of tarts in a large pediatric cah population from 0 to 18 years of age .
testicular adrenal rest tumors ( tarts ) are benign intratesticular masses that occur in male patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( cah ) , with more than 90% of cases caused by a deficiency of 21--hydroxylase .
therefore , the early detection of tarts is important to preserve testicular function , and scrotal baseline ultrasound ( bus ) screening is recommended beginning in early childhood .
fifteen male patients involved in this study were aged 4 to 17 years ( mean age , 8.8    3.8 years ) , height 104.6 to 172.5  cm ( mean height , 138.7    22.5 years ) , and weighted 15 to 57  kg ( mean weight , 36.5    14.0  kg ) .
