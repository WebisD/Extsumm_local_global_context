implementation of the national advisory to use auto - disable syringes for all medical injections could radically improve patient safety and reduce the burden of disease from chronic and stigmatizing infections in the most vulnerable segments of society .
the total number of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infections that would result from unsafe medical injections in india in 2010 , barring the introduction of auto - disable syringes for all medical injections , is estimated following the mass action model used to develop the world health organization global burden of disease estimates.(6 ) the incidence of each blood - borne virus iv is a product of the size of the susceptible population ps , the probability of transmission in an unsafe medical injection for each virus ptv , and the number of contaminated medical injections performed nc , as given in equation ( 1 ) .
recent outbreak investigations suggest that many injection providers believe it is safe to reuse a syringe after changing the needle , that it is safe to reuse injection equipment to access an iv line , or that it is safe to reuse injection equipment on the same patient when reconstituting from a multidose vial , without sterilization.(2 ) these misconceptions are still reported in high - income developed countries and are thought to be prevalent in the developing world.(3 ) even more troubling , recycling of sharps waste for repackaging and resale is practiced on a large scale in india , uncovered recently in the investigation of a deadly hepatitis b outbreak.(4 ) the goal of this review is to evaluate the incremental cost - benefit of using the auto - disable syringe for all medical injections in india , in terms of prevented disability and mortality from hepatitis b , hepatitis c , and hiv infections .
