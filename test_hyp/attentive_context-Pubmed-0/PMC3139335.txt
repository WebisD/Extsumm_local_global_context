46 cases of gossybipoma involving the spine have been reported;  however , it is thought to be more than this number because of medico - legal issues . in this report , we present a case of paravertebral gossybipoma , with a short review of the clinical presentation , radiologic findings and differential diagnosis of these lesions .
a 40-year - old woman presented with a history of spinal operation for l4l5 lumbar disk herniation before 8 months and got admitted with non - purulent serous leakage from a small ( 5 mm ) detachment in the surgical wound .
in patients with the history of spinal operation , gossybipomas should always have a place in the differential diagnosis of newly found lesions , as it is believed that they are much more common than they are reported .
while the term  textiloma  is used to describe a mass lesion consisting of surgical sponge , the term  gossybipoma  is reserved for both the mass of sponge and the foreign body reaction around it .
their presentation is well known but varies with each case due to different kinds of reactions of body . in literature ,
however , no pathognomic radiologic characteristics are defined for these lesions . for this reason , the definitive diagnosis must be mainly aided by the high suspicion profile of the physician and the intraoperative findings .
