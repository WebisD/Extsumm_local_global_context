of the 13 patients in the conventional tfesi group , nine showed effective treatment two weeks after tfesi ( 69.2% ) , and 18 of the 20 patients ( 90% ) in the preganglionic tfesi group showed effective treatment , and the difference in the two rates of effective treatment was of borderline significance ( p = 0.056 ; odds ratio 10.483 ) .
the cause of radiculopathy , the age of the groups , gender and the duration of symptoms were not found to be statistically related to the effectivness of tfesi ( p > 0.05 ) .
the mean age was 53.9 years ( sd : 13.4 ) in the conventional tfesi group and it was was 55.8 years ( sd : 14.8 ) in the preganglionic tfesi group .
third , other factors that probably influenced the therapeutic effect were not included . in conclusion , preganglionic tfesi was found to have a better therapeutic effect on the radiculopathy caused by compression at the supra - adjacent level than did conventional tfesi , and this result had borderline statistical significance .
the inclusion criteria were ( a ) the presence of lumbar radiculopathy , ( b ) nerve root compression in the paracentral or subarticular region at the level of the supra - adjacent intervertebral disc ( for example , at the l4 - 5 disc level for the l5 nerve root ) , ( c ) one level tfesi from l1 to s1 , ( d ) no prior therapeutic tfesi , ( e ) no prior surgery , and ( f ) clear identification of the nerve root compression by using a cross - sectional imaging study ( either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging ) .
