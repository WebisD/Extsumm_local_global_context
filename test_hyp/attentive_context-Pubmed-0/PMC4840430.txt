the goal of this study was to test the efficacy of the varia ( video , accelerometry , and radar - induced activity recording ) system and algorithms for tonic  clonic and clonic seizures compared with that of semicontinuous monitoring by professional caregivers ( keeping an eye on multiple patients ) , as well as the independence , robustness , comfort , and user - friendliness of the system .
we therefore measure long term in a home environment without uncomfortable and stigmatizing electroencephalography ( eeg ) electrodes rather than in a video / eeg monitoring unit , and the system therefore needs to be able to store the data and to allow visual verification of detected events .
this study demonstrates the first clinical results of an algorithm for the detection of tonic  clonic and clonic seizures tested on two patients with epilepsy monitored in a long - term home environment with the varia system ( video , accelerometry , and radar - induced activity recording ) developed by our team .
compared with the professional caregivers ' observations , a mean sensitivity of 61.97% and false detection rate of 1.44 per night were obtained with the nonpatient - specific approach and a mean sensitivity of 66.87% and false detection rate of 1.16 per night with the semipatient - specific approach .
