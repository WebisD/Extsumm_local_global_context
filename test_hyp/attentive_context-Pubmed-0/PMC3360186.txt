however , the occurrence of type ii , iii , and iv fractures were usually observed in incidents involving more severe trauma ( p = 0.019 ) .
patient information was obtained over a six year period from 2003 and 2009 and included a description of the specific trauma episodes , surgical records , x - rays and mri of all patients with avulsion fracture of calcaneal tuberosity .
all the fibers of the achilles tendon were involved in type i and ii fractures , but only the superficial fibers were involved in type iii fractures and the deep fibers in type iv fractures respectively ( fig .
the fracture patterns are created through osteoporosis , the mechanism of injury and fibers of the achilles tendon that transmit the force .
a direct blow to the bone was the dominant cause of type ii fractures and falling for type iii and iv fractures .
the surgery was difficult in the approach to deep fibers and in the management of fragments involved , leading to inferior treatment for the type iv as opposed to type iii fractures .
this difference in age and gender were significant when comparing type i fracture with the three other types of fractures ( p = 0.010 , p = 0.018 ) .
