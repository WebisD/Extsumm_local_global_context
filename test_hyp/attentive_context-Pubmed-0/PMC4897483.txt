the aim of this study was to prove the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal resection in kidney transplant recipients by evaluating the technical protocol and the short- and long - term outcomes .
this retrospective review of all kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer who received laparoscopic or robotic resection was conducted between may 2007 and august 2012 at yonsei university college of medicine , south korea .
technical proficiency , experience , and the use of a multidisciplinary team approach including an oncologist and transplant team can result in a successful procedure and ensure the safety of the transplanted kidney .
four ( 40% ) patients underwent an anterior and a low anterior resection , two ( 20% ) underwent a covering ileostomy and a right hemicolectomy , and one patient ( 10% ) underwent a left hemicolectomy .
the mean carcinoembryonic antigen level was 3.66  2.53 ( range 0.729.18 )  ng / ml and the mean white blood cell count was 7 , 315  3,842 ( range 2,99016,520 )  mm .
one patient underwent adjuvant chemoradiation ( xeloda ( capecitabine ) + radiation ) and four patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy alone ( fluorouracil , leucovorin , folic acid , oxaliplatin ( folfox ) in three cases , and 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin in one case ) . over a median follow - up period of 31.4  21.57 ( range 263 ) months , no mortality occurred .
