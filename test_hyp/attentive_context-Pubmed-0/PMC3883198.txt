dosing of ufh in morbidly obese and obese critically ill patients based on actual body weight and a reduced initial dose was associated with similar time to first therapeutic aptt and steady state .
the median proportion of aptt values were subtherapeutic in 33% ( 12.5 - 55% ) of non - obese , 19% ( 7.5 - 33% ) of obese , and 17.5% ( 1.75 - 39.75% ) of morbidly obese ( p = 0.17 ) , and the median proportion of aptts that were supratherapeutic were 20% ( 9 - 31.5% ) non - obese , 33% ( 8.5 - 45.5% ) obese and 20% ( 2.25 - 39.5% ) morbidly obese ( p = 0.43 ) .
. unlike dosing at first therapeutic aptt , correction of doses using actual body weight did not resolve the discrepancy in doses for achieving steady state ( 16.3  5.3 units / kg / h non - obese , 11.6  5.5 units / kg / h obese , vs. 11.1  1.2 units / kg / h morbidly obese , p = 0.01 ) .
the median proportion of aptts in the therapeutic range was 47% ( 17.5 - 64.5% ) non - obese , 45% ( 33 - 66.5% ) obese , and 60% ( 50 - 64% ) for morbidly obese ( p = 0.33 ) .
