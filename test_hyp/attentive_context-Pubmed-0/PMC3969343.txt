we share a novel , simple surgical approach to management of a case of chronic traumatic cyclodialysis cleft with a successful outcome .
additionally , we demonstrate clinical success with cleft closure in an eye with chronic hypotony .
cyclodialysis cleft has been reported to occur in 3.4% of cases of ocular injury or globe rupture.2 additionally , one large review of 291 cases involving cyclodialysis suggested that hypotony occurs 9% of the time.3 medical treatment with atropine ophthalmic drops and laser therapy to promote reattachment of the ciliary body to the scleral spur are options for repair of this entity , but larger and more chronic cyclodialyses often require surgical repair.4,5 because of their rarity , reports on surgical repair techniques in the literature are limited .
cyclodialysis cleft is a rare clinical finding , but one that can have significant ocular complications , including decreased vision , shallowing of the anterior chamber , corneal edema , hypotony , choroidal effusions , maculopathy , vascular tortuosity , and optic disc edema .
we present a simple , less - invasive approach to surgical cleft closure that was successful anatomically and functionally .
while it can be caused by surgical manipulation of the eye , it is more frequently a consequence of trauma.1 traumatic injury to the eye results in separation of the ciliary body from the scleral spur , which creates an aberrant outflow pathway for aqueous humor through the suprachoroidal space and often leads to hypotony .
