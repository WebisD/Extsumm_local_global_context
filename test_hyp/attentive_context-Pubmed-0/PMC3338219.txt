ununited fractures of clavicle are occasionally seen in adults , but are rarely found in children . post - traumatic non - union of the clavicle is a rare complication in adulthood with a frequency of about 1% .
an 8-year - old male child presented with a right - sided clavicular fracture for one year .
surgery is required in about one in 100 cases in which there is remaining deformity .
clavicular fractures usually occur at the junction of the medial two third with the lateral one third of the bone and usually heal by conservative treatment within three weeks .
this condition is also exceptional in children , despite the frequency of clavicular fracture at any given age .
a patient with an atrophic pattern of non - union may become asymptomatic with time .
the explicable evidence of osseous non - union on radiographs may be minor and may not correlate with the clinical symptoms .
careful attention should be paid when obtaining a detailed history and physical examinations , as traumatic arthritis at either clavicular joint may mimic the symptoms of non - union .
if a surgical procedure is planned , possible outcomes should be communicated to the patient , including the possibility of additional surgery , if required .
