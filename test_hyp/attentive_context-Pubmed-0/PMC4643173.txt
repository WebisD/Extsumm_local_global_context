from june 2013 to may 2014 , a total of 47 symptomatic bph patients who underwent the all - in - one technique of thulep were evaluated .
after 1 month , mean trus prostate volume was 11.710.0 cm , mean transitional zone volume was 0.94.8 cm , mean psa was 0.50.4 ng / ml , mean ipss was 17.510.0 , mean qmax was 15.67.8 ml / s , and mean pvr was 30.020.7 ml .
after 3 months , mean ipss was 11.57.1 , mean qmax was 15.89.0 ml / s , and mean pvr was 27.317.5 ml .
the 3-month follow - up ipss was significantly improved compared with the 1-month follow - up score ( p<0.05 ) .
mean operative time was 82.133.3 minutes , mean enucleation time was 52.721.7 minutes , mean morcellation time was 8.27.0 minutes , mean resected tissue weight was 36.924.6 g , mean hemoglobin decrease was 0.40.8 g / dl , and mean number of catheterization days was 2.82.0 days ( table 1 ) .
the recently introduced thulium laser has a wavelength similar to that of the holmium laser but has been found to be superior in spatial beam quality , precise incision , and wave continuity . in comparative studies , thulium laser enucleation of the prostate ( thulep ) showed results comparable to those of holep . in this study , we introduce a new one - lobe enucleation technique of thulep .
