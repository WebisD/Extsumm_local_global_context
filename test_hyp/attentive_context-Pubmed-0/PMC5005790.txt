 the use of sodium hypochlorite as toilet detergent is related to a red - brown urine discolouration in patients taking mesalamine.it seems that the red - brown discolouration relates to a harmless reaction.polymerisation of mesalamine and/or metabolites could be a theoretical mechanism of this discolouration . 

this case concerned a 38-year - old male with a history of crohn s disease .
mesalamine is also associated with the renal adrs of renal failure , interstitial nephritis and haematuria   . in the period from august 2009 to april 2015 , the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb received two case reports of red - brown urine discolouration in association with mesalamine .
based on the described reports and the case reports in the literature , we suggest a causal relationship between red  brown discolouration of urine after contact with sodium hypochlorite detergent and the use of mesalamine .
the exact working mechanism of mesalamine is not fully understood , but it appears to have anti - inflammatory properties .
the most common adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) , as described in the summary of product characteristics ( smpc ) , are headache , rash and gastrointestinal symptoms , including diarrhoea , nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain .
