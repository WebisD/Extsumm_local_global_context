the aim of the present study was to investigate the early activation of tgf- signaling in the lungs of a murine model of acute pancreatitis - associated ali .
our data showed an early rise in smad7 which can block the tgf-/smad2 signaling . with disease progression , the smad7 levels were reduced with a concomitant increase in nuclear translocation of phosphorylated smad2 , an indicator of active tgf-/smad2 signaling .
a parallel increase in the signaling regulator and general inhibitor of the tgf- signaling transduction , smad7 , was found at 9  h. later in the course of the disease at 24  h the levels of tgf1 and alk5 remained high , while levels of the inhibitory smad7 were reduced back to the level of the sham - operated animals .
, we show that tgf- signaling modulation starts as early as 9  h in the lungs of animals with acute pancreatitis - associated acute lung injury .
in summary , the present study shows an early rise in tgf-1 and alk5 which may activate the tgf-/smad2 signaling or alternative pathways to contribute to ali .
the anti - inflammatory activities of increased smad7 at early phase in our model can be interpreted as a protective mechanism in the lungs of the animals with acute pancreatitis . in this study , we showed increased levels of both tgf-1 and alk5 in the lungs as early as 9  h after the induction of acute pancreatitis .
