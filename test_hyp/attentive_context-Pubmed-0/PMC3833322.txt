the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a randomized control trial of therapeutic tai chi training on improving the motor function and physical function of parkinson 's disease patients .
however , as shown in figures 3 and 4 , there were significant ( p < 0.05 ) interaction effects for balance ( one - leg standing test ) and reaction time ( light stimulus ) .
the findings of our study showed modest effectiveness of tai chi training on people with parkinson 's disease , with significant interaction effects for balance , reaction time , and adls .
in this study , we investigated the motor and nonmotor effects of therapeutic tai chi exercise training on participants with pd .
as shown in table 3 , significant changes were observed in the mentation , behavior , and mood subscale and the motor subscale of the updrs , with no significant main effects on the activities of daily living scale ( adl ) , balance , or reaction time .
participants were randomized to either a twelve - week intervention of therapeutic tai chi ( ttc ) or a non - exercise control group ( see figure 1 ) .
