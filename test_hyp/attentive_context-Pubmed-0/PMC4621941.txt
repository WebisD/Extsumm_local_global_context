under the conditions of the present study , we can conclude that the daily application of an experimental mouthrinse containing a specific combination of tif4 and naf has the ability to reduce dentin erosion in vitro , and may be a good alternative for high - risk populations .

all experimental mouthrinses promoted significantly lower dentin erosive loss when compared to the negative control ( p<0.0001 ) , except naf solution ( prevention fraction of 13.3% ; p>0.05 ) .
