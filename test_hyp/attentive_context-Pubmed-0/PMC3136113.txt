therefore , the present study was designed to investigate the effects of four different types of meals ( normal , high - fat , hgi , and lgi ) on fat and cho metabolism during exercise in elderly male subjects .
the present study is the first study designed to investigate the effects of pre - exercise mixed meals on fat and carbohydrate metabolism during exercise in elderly individuals , and its principle finding was that in spite of some changes in fat metabolites , the composition of the meal did not result in differences in cho and fat oxidation .  
what we can state is that , on balance , eating any type of meal 3 hours prior to a 30-minutes bout of exercise is unlikely to significantly impact on so - called  fat burning  in healthy elderly males .
these results are in contrast to the data reported by previous studies in young subjects that observed a rise in fat oxidation after hf due to increases in fatty acid ( fa ) availability and mobilization   .
mmol / l ) and decreased significantly after eating hgi ( from 0.44  0.09 to 0.13  0.02  mmol / l ) and lgi ( from 0.55  0.08 to 0.27  0.07
