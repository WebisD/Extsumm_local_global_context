biomarkers for the early diagnosis , management , and treatment of alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) are important . in vivo cross - section imaging during an annual comprehensive eye exam with a dilated pupil has been available for a decade for glaucoma and macular degeneration , and this same imaging , using optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , has been demonstrated to show deficits specific to ad   and mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) .
the visual system provides opportunity to use noninvasive clinical tools to identify and monitor biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases such as ad .
the first published reports of imaging in vivo retinal tissue with oct were in 1993   , and the first reports of oct use showing significant deficits in the eyes of participants with ad were in 2001 .
/ spectral / high resolution - oct may prove to be an efficient , cost - effective means of identifying and monitoring biomarkers of early ad .
oct imaging has demonstrated structural nerve fiber deficits in the eye in early alzheimer 's disease as well as mild cognitive impairment . imaging with faster technology with significantly higher resolution such as the fourier
the number of those with ad in the united states is approaching 5.1 million , and this number is expected to reach 13.2 million by the year 2050 .
