in this case study , we report on a patient with a 25% tbsa burn treated with fbc matrix postexcision that healed without subsequent autologous skin grafting .
consistent with previous reports that use fbc , the outcomes of this study suggest that the regenerated dermal tissue aided by the fbc contributed to the durability , functionality , and appearance of the healed wound . in summary
, these results encourage further use of fbc to treat patients with deep partial thickness and full thickness burns for possible wound coverage .
the patient had a 25% tbsa burn , which included a mixture of second - degree , deep second - degree , and third - degree burns involving the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity , the medial aspect of the left lower extremity , and the dorsum of both feet ( figure 1a ) .
long - term follow - up indicated excellent functional and cosmetic outcomes for an injury of this extent and size that healed without autologous grafting .
immunohistological analysis of biopsies obtained 12 days post - fbc application demonstrated that the fbc was capable of generating a dermal component approximately 0.75 mm to 1 mm in thickness with the capacity to support reepithelialization .
