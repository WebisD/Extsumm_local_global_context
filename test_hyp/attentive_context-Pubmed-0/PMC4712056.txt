the association of congenital seminal vesicle cyst with ipsilateral renal malformations is rare and was first described by zinner in 1914 .
it is reported in literature as  zinner syndrome.3 this condition is considered as the male equivalent of mayer - rokitansky - kustner - hauser ( mrkh ) syndrome described in females.4 

congenital seminal vesicle cysts in patients with ipsilateral renal agenesis are rare but this association is well known .
a 4-year - old boy with known right renal agenesis discovered on antenatal ultrasound , presented in our radiology department for his annual control .
diagnosis is more frequently made in adult life during the period of the greatest sexual or reproductive activity.1 
 2 we present a case of a congenital seminal vesicle cyst associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis incidentally discovered on ultrasound at the age of 4 years and its natural evolution until adolescence .
pediatric surgeons should be aware and consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of cystic pelvic masses in males with renal agenesis or dysplasia .
congenital seminal vesicle cysts associated with abnormalities of the upper urinary tract are uncommon.1 they can be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally or can be associated with dysuria , urinary tract infections , and infertility .
