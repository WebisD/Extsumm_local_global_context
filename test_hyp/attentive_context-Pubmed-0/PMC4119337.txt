considering the rapidly progressive course , poor prognosis and increasing incidence in non - hiv patients , early and accurate diagnosis of cg by the renal pathologist may assist in improving the renal outcome of these patients .
children constituted about one - third of all patients with idiopathic cg , thus implying that timely performed renal biopsy and early recognition of this entity is imperative in this age group as well .
collapsing glomerulopathy ( cg ) was initially described in association with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection and classified as a variant of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) .
tubular atrophy ( involving > 25% of the cortical area ) was noted in 12 cases ( 40% ) with marked atrophy ( > 50% of cortical area ) in two cases . rest 18 cases showed minimal to mild tubular atrophy ( < 25% of cortical area ) .
clinical and biochemical parameters between childhood and adult - onset cg renal biopsy in all the included cases was adequate with a mean of 13.3 glomeruli ( 1.66 ) per biopsy .
in addition , an attempt is made to compare these features between childhood and adult - onset cg .
