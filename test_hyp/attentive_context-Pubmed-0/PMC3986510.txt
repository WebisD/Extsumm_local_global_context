although clinical experience with pharmacological tools reducing tissue and plasma levels of sphingolipids is still missing , a solid body of circumstantial evidence is available to justify investment in experimental clinical studies bridging existing gaps in the translation of preclinical data to relevant clinical setting .
most importantly , we are short of thoroughly safety profiled agents that can be applied clinically to deliver graded tissue specific inhibition of enzymes involved in sphingolipid synthesis . provided
such investigational compounds become available it will become possible to link quantifiable tissue specific reductions of sphingolipids to level of improvement of insulin sensitivity in both normal individuals as well as in people with insulin resistance .
admittedly , the current review is rather ceramide centric as most studies have been particularly focused on the negative impact of this class of polar lipids on glycemic control .
the search for underlying mechanistic explanations on cellular and tissue level have been intensified and a growing body of observational as well as mechanistic evidence has been generated demonstrating the important contribution of lipids to obesity induced insulin resistance .
it is believed that two elements contribute to the emergence of type 2 diabetes : insulin resistance and lipo - toxicity .
