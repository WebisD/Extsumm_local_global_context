instead , we discuss recent findings regarding osteopetrosis and how the study of this disease has contributed to new understanding of functions associated with the skeleton   .
our objective in this review is not to give a detailed description of all the sclerosing bone diseases ; such information can be found in other reviews   .
important progress has been made during the past decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hereditary diseases characterized by increased bone mass   .
bone is a dynamic tissue which undergoes continuous self - renewal , and bone homeostasis relies on functional equilibrium among three types of cells : osteoclasts essential for bone resorption , osteoblasts responsible for bone matrix formation , and osteocytes involved in the reception and transduction of mechanical stimuli and in the regulation of osteoclast / osteoblast differentiation and function .
osteopetrosis ( osteo : bone and petros : stone ) regroups a set of rare , heterogeneous , and inherited bone diseases characterized by increased bone mass .
the balance between bone synthesis and resorption is finely tuned and any perturbations of this balance in adults trigger bone disease .
osteopetrosis is therefore an osteocondensing disease . in principle , two causes could give rise to this osteocondensing phenotype : increased bone formation or failure of resorption by osteoclasts .
