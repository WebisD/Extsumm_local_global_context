the case we report presented with cutaneous sarcoidosis during chc therapy and spontaneous regression of the lesions was noted with treatment discontinuation .
the treatment of chronic hepatitis c ( chc ) has evolved in the last 15 years from monotherapy with interferon alpha ( ifnalpha ) to the combination treatment with pegylated ifn ( peg - ifn ) plus ribavirin for 24 - 48 weeks . up to now , several viral , host and drug - related reactions in response to ifnalpha - based therapy have been identified .
a 44-year - old man with chc genotype 1a and a viral load of hcv > 800,000 iu / ml , a2-f1 on liver biopsy according to metavir criteria , was treated for the hepatic disease .
, eight cases of sarcoidosis as a complication of ifn therapy in chc have been reported in the english language literature .
more recently there have been reported dermatological diseases in patients receiving the combination of ifn / ribavirin or ifn / ribavirin / amantadine for the treatment of chc .
we intend to emphasize , especially to dermatologists , the risks of a granulomatous tattoo and other cutaneous sites during chc treatment with peg - ifnalpha-2b plus ribavirin .
