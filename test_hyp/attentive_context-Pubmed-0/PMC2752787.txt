we present a case of pseudo no - reflow phenomenon after postdilatation of the stent in severe carotid artery stenosis and successful recovery with aspiration thrombectomy using export aspiration catheter .
a 70-yr - old man was diagnosed with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis during preoperative risk assessments .
our case is the first case report of pseudo - no - reflow phenomenon in carotid artery stenting using filter type distal protection device and successful recovery of this phenomenon by aspiration thrombectomy using export aspiration catheter .
the interventions for carotid artery stenosis , vein graft and acute myocardial infarction could embolize a large amount of plaque debris , especially unstable , ulcerative , and thrombus containing lesions ( 1 ) . distal protection devices such as filterwire ex
have been widely used in carotid artery stenting to prevent distal embolization of plaque debris ( 2 ) .
( 5 ) recently reported that successful management of pseudo - no - reflow phenomenon by the export aspiration catheter in ostial saphenous vein graft intervention using filterwire ex protection . in conclusion
the patient complained of slight speech disturbance and this neurological abnormality was completely recovered within 24 hr after stenting .
