we performed a closed reduction with a percutaneous leverage technique and internal fixation method with k - wires to treat angulated radial neck fractures in children .
we recommend the percutaneous leverage technique during closed reduction and internal fixation using k - wires for the treatment of angulated radial neck fractures in children .
this is a simple method with little trauma to the patient and a satisfactory clinical outcome .
these techniques include closed reduction , percutaneous pin reduction , intramedullary pin reduction with elastic stable intramedullary nailing or kirschner - wires ( k - wires ) , and open reduction with or without internal fixation .
from january 2011 to april 2013 , we treated 16 cases of angulated radial neck fractures in 12 boys and 4 girls .
( a ) the preoperative x - ray showed the severe tilt and displacement of radial neck .
our goals for treatment are to avoid incision , reduce the fracture adequately with no reduction loss , and achieve good postoperative function .
the types of fractures categorized by the obrien classification as follows : type i  angulation < 30 ; type ii 
angulation > 60. among our patients , 5 had type ii and 11 had type iii fractures .
