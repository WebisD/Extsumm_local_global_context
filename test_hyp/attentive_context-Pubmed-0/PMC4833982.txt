, we analyzed asd patients admitted in our center with and without af who underwent successful transcatheter closure in an attempt to determine the feasibility of device closure of asd and observe resultant hemodynamic changes in such patients .
the 6 months follow - up period showed that changes of the rv volume and ra volume in the case group were significantly less than those in the control group ( * p < 0.05 ; rv : right ventricular ; ra : right atrial ) .
our study has demonstrated that the procedure can improve cardiac remodeling and heart function in patients both with and without af , even in patients with permanent af .
the clinical medical records of 289 consecutive adult patients older than 40 years who underwent transcatheter asd closure at our center between october 2009 and october 2013 were analyzed retrospectively .
changes of the rv volume and ra volume in the case group were significantly smaller as compared with those of the control group ( 20.74  10.68 ml to 24.69  9.46 ml , p = 0.005 ; 27.53  12.68 ml to 36.63  13.79 ml , p
our study demonstrated that the transcatheter closure of asd in patients with permanent af is safe and feasible as in the case with patients without af .
