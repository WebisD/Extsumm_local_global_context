we will review the role of endothelial dysfunction and especially inflammation - induced apoptosis of endothelial cells in obesity - related diabetes mellitus and its co - morbidities .
several studies indicate that microvascular cell apoptosis plays an important role in the development of early lesions   .  
the relation between diabetic micro- and macroangiopathy and endothelial dysfunction is complex and is still a subject of extensive research . especially in type 2 diabetes a lot of factors
more insights into the exact mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction may lead to important treatment strategies which can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality rate caused by endothelial dysfunction especially in diabetes patients .
although apoptosis is a natural phenomenon in all multicellular organisms , an increased and accelerated rate of apoptosis of endothelial cells is probably a crucial factor in diabetic co - morbidity .
an imbalance in repair and injury resulting in early microvascular changes , including apoptosis of microvascular cells , can be seen in both experimental diabetic animal models and humans with diabetes .
dysfunction of the endothelium is regarded as an important factor in the pathogenesis of vascular disease in diabetes mellitus   .
a treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress in endothelial cells may be an answer to this major problem , especially since diabetes will soon become an even bigger health problem involving more than 5% of the world population .
