age - adjusted estimates for associations between behavioral factors and the risk of four most common cancers ( lung , prostate , breast , and colon ) were calculated by three methods : ( i ) calculating the age - adjusted rates with adjusting of each subpopulation ( i.e. , with positive and negative outcomes for a specific question ) for total population ; ( ii ) based on the proportional hazard model with two approaches for choosing the follow - up variables based on age and ( iii ) on time .
these approaches could provide with the steps toward the individualized forecasting of cancer risk potentially resulting in preventive strategies which could be oriented to population groups with specific characteristics such as those obtained from the indices and association / confounding findings of this study .
the most influential ( i.e. , demonstrated the strongest association with cancer risk ) of potentially controllable risk factors can be detected using the approach developed in this paper   and then applied to further deeper analyses , including other data sets with detailed risk factors description / characteristics , for example , analyses of duration of exposure and intensity of risk factor .
