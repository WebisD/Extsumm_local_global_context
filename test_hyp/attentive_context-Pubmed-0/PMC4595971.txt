the present study involves the use of oleic acid vesicles to encapsulate dexamethasone and evaluates , its potential as an alternative drug delivery system for effective topical application .
  based upon above results it can be concluded that encapsulation of drug in fatty acid vesicles can serve as potential carriers for the delivery of anti - inflammatory drug .
cost effectiveness , therapeutically viability , and sustained release behaviour along with drug retention in the deeper part of skin might be beneficial for the long - term effects of drugs .
the fatty acid in addition may serve as a penetration enhancer , thus by avoiding the stratum corneum barrier potential they may lead to better permeation of the drug molecules .
when dexamethasone was associated with fatty acid vesicles and its anti - inflammatory activity evaluated by inhibition , carrageenan edema a significant reduction of edema ( p < 0.10 ) was measured in comparison to the commercial product .
the fatty acid vesicles were evaluated to assess their efficacy in delivering the bioactives to and through stratum corneum of the skin .
sem studies using rat skin were also conducted in order to explain the effect of fatty acid vesicles on the surface morphology of skin .
