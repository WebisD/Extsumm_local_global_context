we described two cases of toxoplasma gondii pneumonia in hiv patients in the haart era .
in conclusion , pulmonary toxoplasmosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of hiv positive patients with late stage of hiv infection , cd4 t cell counts less than 100 cells/l , a poor adherence or failure to haart and with fever , cough and pulmonary radiological infiltrates .
the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) and antibiotic prophylaxis against pulmonary opportunistic infections have resulted in considerable reduction of morbidity and mortality of this kind of patients . some of hiv - infected patients have pulmonary opportunistic infections in the haart era associated with different causes including patients who are unaware of their hiv serostatus and do not initiate haart , late stage of hiv infection , cd4 count less than 100 cells/l , haart non - adherence or failure to respond , injection drug use and failure to provide prophylaxis against opportunistic pathogens .
pulmonary toxoplasmosis accounts for 4% of all cases of pneumonia in hiv - infected patients in the pre - haart era and is not considered commonly during the haart era .
pulmonary toxoplasmosis is the second location of extracerebral toxoplasmosis after the ocular form , with 40% of mortality without early diagnosis and specific treatment .
