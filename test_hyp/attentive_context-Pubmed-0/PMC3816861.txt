ir - isl transplant recipients demonstrate both lower insulin response and lower basal rates of proinsulin processing , which remain suboptimal even after arginine stimulation ( i.e. , loss of graft function is associated with less effective processing and relative hyperproinsulinemia )
creatinine levels were elevated in the pancreas and ir - isl groups with respect to the ii - isl and healthy control groups ( p < 0.005 vs. control , p < 0.05 vs. ii - isl ) .
third , after stimulation , ii - isl , pancreas , and healthy control subjects all increase their proinsulin - processing ratios to a similar level .
we have shown , first , that the exposure to arginine stimulation is in fact similar in ii - isl transplant recipients and healthy control subjects .
ii - isl patients have proinsulin - processing ratios similar to those of pancreas transplant recipients , which are significantly higher than those of healthy control and ir - isl patients .
as expected , recipients of pancreas transplants with systemic venous drainage demonstrate higher insulin response to arginine than healthy control subjects .
in contrast , ir - isl patients are unable to achieve the same increase in proinsulin - processing rate .
