we report our experience with esd for sessile and flat rectal and sigmoid colon lesions in a high - volume center in russia .
, 19 procedures ( 43.1  % ) were classified as technically difficult due to the following factors : procedure time >  120 minutes , 12 patients ; combination of procedure time >  120 minutes and piecemeal resection , six patients ; and piecemeal resection , one patient .
mean tumor size was significantly larger in the difficult esd group compared with the standard esd group , 48.31    5.96 and 24.48    1.75  mm , respectively ( p  =  0.0001 ) .
severe submucosal fibrosis was an important factor associated with a low rate of en bloc resection and a high risk of perforation during the learning curve for colorectal esd
colorectal esd is associated with a relatively long learning curve , and 22 esd cases might not be sufficient to improve en bloc resection rates , reduce procedure times and the number of perforations during a further 22 resections .
during the period from november 2009 to september 2013 , 44 patients with sessile and flat rectal and sigmoid colon lesions underwent esd at the department of endoscopy , vladivostok clinical railway hospital ( russia ) .
