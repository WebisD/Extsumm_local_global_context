the main aim of this study was to determine relation between rodents active burrows and incidence of zcl in golestan province using spatial analysis .
results of current study indicated the direct relationship between the burrows of rodents and zcl prevalence . therefore the presences of rodents as the reservoir host of disease play an important role on prevalence as well as incidence rate of disease . considering this , control of rodents will have an important role in controlling the disease .
number of positive cases of zcl in golestan province , 2013 based on the statistical analysis of data , there were significant difference between the number of rodent 's active burrows with the number of positive cases ( 0.465 , p < 0.001 ) as well as , the incidence of disease ( 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) .
among all counties of golestan province , the highest incidence rate of the disease were observed in moravehtappeh ( 121.5/100000 ) and gonbad kavoos ( 99.3/100000 ) respectively ( table 1 ) .
it should be noted that , 60.2 % of patients were male . in the assess the existence of rodent 's active burrows in a radius of 300 meters from the villages , they were found only in the rural districts of gonbad kavoos and moraveh tappeh counties . in the rest of studied districts ,
