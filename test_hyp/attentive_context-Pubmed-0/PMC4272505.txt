cocksfoot is the most common grass pollen in rhinitis group , and meadow and in asthma group of patients .
the study is a retrospective , population analysis of the results of skin prick tests to aeroallergens in patients with nasobronchial allergy .
the aim of this study was to determine hypersensitivity to the most common aeroallergens among our patients with nasobronchial allergy and to determine whether there are differences in hypersensitivity between rhinitis and asthma .
the rhinitis group of patients had the greatest number of positive skin prick tests for house dust mite and all pollens , than the asthma group .
positive skin prick tests to weed pollens in the total sample tested to six individual , grass pollens showed highest number of positive tests to cocksfoot ( 14.4% ) and meadow grass ( 14.3% ) .
it is consistent with the results of similar studies which included more women than men , and with a higher incidence of adult non - atopic rhinitis in women .
patients with rhinitis had more positive tests for cocksfoot ( 15.3% ) , but the patients with asthma for meadow grass ( 12.6% ) .
* dermatophagoides pteronyssinus results of skin prick test for individual weed pollens in the total sample and by group of disease show that they were mostly positive to ragweed ( 28.9% ) , then followed by mugwort ( 11% ) and plantain ( 8.1% ) .
