the 
 answer to this question seems obvious when three broad areas of research and 
 development are identified in which manipulation of metabolic pathways is 
 relevant : ( a ) drug design to treat diseases , ( b ) genetic engineering of 
 organisms of biotechnological interest , and ( c ) genetic syndromes therapy .
is an effort to manipulate the metabolism of an organism worthy and reasonable , 	 knowing 
 that this cellular process has been continuously modified and refined through 
 evolution and natural selection for adapting , in the most convenient manner , to 
 the ongoing environmental conditions ?
historically , drug design was 
 the first area in which modification of metabolism was tried : the primary goal 
 of drug administration is the inhibition of essential metabolic pathways , for 
 example , in a parasite or a tumor cell .
thus , any metabolic pathway can be a potential 
 therapeutic target . in the absence of a solid 
 theoretical background that may build a strategy for the rational design of 
 drugs ,
the pharmaceutical industry has applied the knowledge of inorganic and 
 organic chemistry for the arbitrary and rather randomized modification of 
 metabolic intermediaries by replacing hydrogen atoms in a model molecule with 
 any other element or compound .
