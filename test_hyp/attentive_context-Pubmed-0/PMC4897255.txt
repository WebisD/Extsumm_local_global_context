after nc , the presence of cis was associated with worse os ( p = 0.04 ) and cn+ was associated with worse rfs ( p < 0.01 ) , arfs ( p < 0.01 ) , and os ( p < 0.01 ) . following pc , presence of pt2 disease
in this contemporary institutional series , pc after nc in highly selected patients with muscle - invasive bladder cancer provides acceptable oncologic outcomes comparable to those in previously published reports .
was associated with worse rfs ( p = 0.02 ) and arfs ( p = 0.01 ) , pn+ was associated with worse rfs ( p = 0.04 ) , and sm+ on final pathology was associated with worse rfs ( p = 0.01 ) , arfs ( p = 0.04 ) , and os ( p < 0.01 ) .
clinical stage > ct2 was associated with both worse rfs ( p = 0.03 ) and arfs ( p < 0.01 ) .
74% of patients were downstaged after nc with 58% having a complete clinical response . of the patients who achieved ct0 after nc , 7 ( 33% ) had evidence of residual disease within the resected specimen at pc , which is close to 30% of understaging with turbt alone reported by our institution 's herr and scher study .
