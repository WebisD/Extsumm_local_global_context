thus , we report the perioperative outcomes of 106 consecutive patients treated with partial nephrectomy by a single surgeon using all three surgical approaches  opn , lpn , and rpn .
nephron sparing surgery has emerged as the optimal surgical approach for t1a and in experienced hands t1b kidney masses . by removing surgeon as a confounding variable ,
, the opn group had the highest incidence of 30-day complications ( 30% ) , while the rpn group had the lowest ( 14% , p = 0.008 ) .
operative time was the shortest in the opn group ( opn163  35  min , lpn227  53  min , rpn244  53  min , p < 0.0001 ) .
discharge hematocrit was significantly lower for opn patients ( 30  3% ) compared to lpn ( 36  4% ) and rpn ( 35  4% ) patients ( p < 0.0001 ) . upon follow - up
among the 106 patients in the study , 23 patients ( 22% ) underwent opn , 48 patients ( 45% ) underwent lpn , and 35 patients ( 33% ) underwent rpn .
preoperative gfr was 71  28  ml / min for opn patients , 76  25  ml / min for lpn patients , and 96  37  ml / min for rpn patients ( p = 0.004 ) .
