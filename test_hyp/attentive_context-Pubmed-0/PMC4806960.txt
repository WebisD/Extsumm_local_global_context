the emm59 subtype of gas , the etiologic agent of a substantial nationwide outbreak of invasive gas in canada during 20062009 ( 4 ) , is now present in arizona , causing at least 1 outbreak of epidemiologically and genomically linked cases and several additional epidemiologically unrelated cases .
we identified isolates for sequencing from 29 invasive gas cases diagnosed in patients in a northern arizona hospital during january 
( 7 ) , in an analysis of 60 mn emm59 isolates from case - patients with identified race , determined that 25 ( 42% ) were from native americans ; of 5 isolates from new mexico in that study , 3 were from native americans .  
epidemiologic investigations , along with healthcare provider and patient education activities , are ongoing in arizona to further determine the extent of the current outbreak and the associated risk factors and to help mitigate effects and limit or prevent further spread to at - risk populations .
following the emm59 epidemic in canada , this subtype was subsequently seen in a few us states ; a retrospective analyses of the centers for disease control and prevention active bacterial core surveillance ( abcs ) system ( http://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/survreports.pdf ) identified 40 us emm59 isolates during 20002009 ( 6 ) and an additional 67 isolates during 20102012 ( 7 ) . of note , only 5 ( of the 40 emm59 isolates from 20002009 ( 2 from minnesota , 2 from california , and 1 from oregon ) appeared to be closely related to the canadian clone ( defined by the authors as being separated by < 16 snps ) ( 6 ) ; in contrast , all of the strains from the 20102012 survey appeared to be more closely related to the canadian clone .
