the objective of this qualitative paper is to explore specific health beliefs , health - seeking behaviors , and self - care practices of people with lymphoedema in nepal for designing socially acceptable and culturally compatible prevention and morbidity management strategies .
an exploratory study was carried out in the three of sixty lf endemic districts in nepal from july to september , 2013 .
lymphoedema in the limbs and hydrocele were found to be major health problems in the studied communities .
the cases of lymphoedema were mapped with the help of female community health volunteers and health workers in the study sites .
this study is a part of the larger study conducted on  parasitological and sociocultural aspects of lymphatic filariasis in nepal . 
the majority of the respondents did not believe that the parasite in the body due to mosquito bites is the real cause of the disease .
the selected districts were dhading ( salyantar village development committee ( vdc ) ) , kapilvastu ( maharajgunj vdc ) , and kailali ( pahalbanpur and malakheti vdcs ) .
this study is perhaps the first of its kind to report health - seeking behaviors and self - care practices of people living with filarial lymphoedema in nepal .
