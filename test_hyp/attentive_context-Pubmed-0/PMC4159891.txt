we report one such rare case in male breast diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) .
neuroendocrine ( ne ) carcinoma of the breast was first described by cubilla and woodruff in 1977 .
but , invasive papillary carcinoma associated with ne carcinoma in the male breast as seen in the present case is an unusual occurrence .
an 80-year - old male presented with a mass in the right breast of 10 years duration with rapid progression in growth since the previous 3 months .
breast cancers encompass a heterogeneous group of tumors exhibiting morphological features similar to those of ne neoplasms of the gut and lung .
primary ne carcinoma of the breast may pose a cyto - histologic diagnostic challenge due to the rarity of its occurrence and paucity of literature .
primary ne carcinomas of the breast are rare and represent about 2 - 3% of breast carcinomas .
ne carcinoma in male breast is a rare entity but does occur and can be diagnosed on fnac .
mammography showed a well - defined mass in the right breast with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy .
they invariably express one or more ne markers ( neuron specific enolase , chromogranin , synaptophysin ) in at least 50% of the tumor cells .
