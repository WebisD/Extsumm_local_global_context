, we attempted to investigate the effect of a. officinalis flower extract ( aofe ) as an antioxidant against nephrotoxicity - induced by gm in male rats .
although aofe acts as an antioxidant , doses of aofe used in the current study did not ameliorate nephrotoxicity induced by gm , and it is necessary to test doses lower than 50 mg / kg .
bun and cr serum levels , ktds , and kw g/100 g body weight in the experiment groups blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and creatinine ( cr ) serum levels , kidney tissue damage score ( ktds ) , and kidney weight g/100 g of body weight in the experiment groups .
administration of various doses of aofe accompanied with gm did not attenuate the serum levels of bun and cr ; rather it increased the values ( p < 0.05 ) .
the two groups were compared with regard to the serum levels of bun and cr , and kidney weight ( kw ) by independent student 's t - test .
gentamicin itself induced nephrotoxicity , which was confirmed by increasing in the serum levels of bun and cr as well as elevating in ktds and kw ( p < 0.05 ) [ table 1 ] .
