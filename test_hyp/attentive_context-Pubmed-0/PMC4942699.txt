in this work , we have shown the efficacy of using optimised moving - average filtering ( oma ) for suppression of the gradient artefact from the scalp potential recorded during continuous eeg - fmri .
according to the established average artefact subtraction ( aas ) methodology , oma is revealed to be capable of obtaining an improved balance compared to aas for the trade - off between effective suppression of the gradient artefact and preservation of the eeg signal . in this respect
oma constitutes a comb - filtering approach , whose application in the scalp potential allows suppression of the gradient artefact and simultaneous estimation of the neuronal eeg . when compared with the slice - average subtraction as performed
such characteristics indicate that our methodology can help to improve the quality of the eeg signal recorded during fmri as well as the performance evaluation of the gradient artefact correction approaches and thus contribute to the consolidation of coregistered eeg - fmri .
integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) with electroencephalography ( eeg ) has offered the possibility of understanding new insights into neuroscientific studies because of the higher temporal and spatial measurements of brain activity when compared with the use of each technique separately . rather than only an additional tool , coregistered eeg - fmri
