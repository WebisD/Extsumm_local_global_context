the current research focus is on the epidemiology and cellular substrate of the chronic kidney damage resulting from an episode of aki .
aki remains an immense clinical problem that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates and affects a growing number of hospitalized patients .
aki remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients , and effective interventions to reduce mortality are currently not available .
answers regarding the cells that are responsible for the progressive interstitial fibrosis after aki have obvious therapeutic relevance . the pathophysiology of aki is highly complex and involves multiple cellular systems , including the endothelium , tubular cells , and leukocytes .
one of the major obstacles that has hampered therapeutic progress in aki is the fact that effective interventions in animals were obtained in otherwise healthy animals but that most patients who develop aki present with significant co - morbidities such as older age , underlying chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , and diabetes  conditions that are not considered in animals .
in addition , aki in most patients occurs as a syndrome of multiple coexisting etiologies , including ischemia , toxicity , and functional impairment , whereas animal models used for the study of its pathophysiology and therapy are generally monocausal and simplistic and often exhibit species - specific characteristics .
