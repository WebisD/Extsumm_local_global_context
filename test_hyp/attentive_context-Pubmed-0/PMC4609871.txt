effective management of cancer cachexia is restricted to early identification of the syndrome ; therefore , biomarkers are vital for development of appropriate therapeutic interventions to achieve better outcomes for individual cancer patients .
cancer cachexia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in cancer patients . by international consensus ,
this article reviews current knowledge around potential prognostic biomarkers of fat loss in cancer which may identify fat - losing cancer patients who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions to improve outcome of cancer patients .
cancer cachexia is proposed to be  a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass with or without loss of fat mass that can not be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment  .
prognostic biomarkers provide information about likely outcome of a disease , regardless of treatment , whilst predictive biomarkers assess the effect of a particular treatment .
one of the major obstacles to identify reliable biomarkers of fat loss in cancer cachexia is variation between studies in how fat loss is assessed .
studies focusing on adipose tissue have identified leptin , free fatty acids ( ffas ) , and glycerol in plasma as indicators of fat alterations in health and diseases . on the other hand , adipokines including inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) and tumour necrosis factor- ( tnf- )   as well as zinc-2-glycoprotein ( zag )   have also been associated with weight and fat loss in cancer . therefore , circulating levels of these factors may represent new noninvasive prognostic biomarker of adipose atrophy and targets in the detection and management of fat loss in cancer .
