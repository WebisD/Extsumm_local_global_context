spontaneous tumors of the rat submandibular gland are very rare , 1   ,   2   and most of them 
                 are diagnosed as adenomas or adenocarcinomas originating from acinar cells and 
                 ductal epithelia .
3   to our knowledge , there 
                 are few reports on detailed analyses of tumors in the submandibular glands of rats .   in the present case , the results of immunohistochemical and ultrastructural 
                 observations indicated that the rat submandibular gland tumor was probably derived 
                 from basal cells located in the duct .
9   in rats , however , there are no reports on the classification 
                 of basal cell adenomas or adenocarcinomas in the submandibular gland .
immunohistochemically , the tumor cells showed a diffusely positive reaction for p63 
                 in the nuclei ( fig .
the animal was a 10-week - old female galas rat 
                 ( brlhan : wist@jcl , purchased from clea japan , inc . , tokyo , japan ) that was assigned 
                 to the control group in a 4-week repeated - dose oral toxicity study and subjected to 
                 the final sacrifice according to the experimental protocol . during the treatment 
                 period
based on these results , the tumor was diagnosed as a spontaneous basal cell 
                 carcinoma . in the normal submandibular gland ,
