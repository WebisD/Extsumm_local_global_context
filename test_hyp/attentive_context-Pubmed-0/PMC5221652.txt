the current study examines a large cohort of om patients ( both um and cm ) to evaluate demographic , pathologic , and clinical factors that affect patient outcomes and alter therapeutic approaches .
ocular melanoma ( om ) , the second most common type of melanoma after cutaneous melanoma , accounts for 3.7% of all melanoma cases.1,2 the incidence rate of om is one per million in the united states ( us ) , and 0.7 per 100,000 among caucasians alone ( age - standardized to the world standard population).2,3 there are two major subtypes of om : those that arise from the iris , choroid , and ciliary body ( uveal melanoma , um ) and those from the conjunctiva ( conjunctival melanoma , cm ) . um is the most common primary intraocular malignancy among adults , and accounts for up to 85% of all cases of om.4,5 the incidence of um in the us is 4.9 per million and has remained stable over the last three decades.6 although um patients typically present with symptoms including blurred vision , visual field defect , metamorphopsia , or photopsia , 30% patients may be asymptomatic and upon routine eye examination , they are detected incidentally.7,8 diagnosis is accurately established by clinical examination in over 99% cases.9 modern diagnostic tools such as a and b ultrasonography , fluorescein angiography , and optical coherence tomography can significantly aid in diagnosis , making it possible to avoid biopsy in nearly all cases.10,11 historically , um has been treated with enucleation , radiation alone , or combination surgery and radiation ; however since the late 1980s , a change in prevailing trends toward radiation has emerged.12 more recently , with growing understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of um , therapeutic trials utilizing adjuvant therapies such as crizotinib , sunitinib , valproic acid , interferon alpha , and dacarbazine have begun to emerge.11 regardless of the initial management method chosen , at least 30% of affected patients will develop metastatic spread to the liver , lung , bone , or skin within 10 years of successful local control of the primary neoplasm , with the liver being involved in up to 95% of cases.13,14 cm accounts for only 5% of all om patients.15 the cm incidence in the us is 0.4 per million and has been increasing progressively.10 among caucasian men alone , the incidence rate increased by 295% over the last 27 years.10 cm occurs most commonly in the bulbar conjunctiva , and rarely in the palpebral and forniceal conjunctiva , plica semilunaris , or caruncula.10,13 cm typically presents in patients over 60 years of age with raised pigmented lesions on the conjunctiva , often surrounded by prominent feeder blood vessels , and these lesions may even be amelanotic.10,13 cms are generally asymptomatic , causing only occasional pain and irritation.10 primary treatment of cm is surgical with wide local excision.1 additional therapies include adjuvant brachytherapy , cryotherapy , and topical chemotherapeutic agents such as mitomycin c.10 metastasis in cm typically involves the salivary lymph nodes , lungs , liver , skin , and brain , with the brain being the most common site of distant metastasis ( involved in up to 25% of cases).10 at present , data detailing survival trends among om patients are based primarily on rare population - based studies involving small groups of patients from high volume melanoma centers.10,16 demographic and clinical factors influencing clinical outcomes in om patients , particularly cm , are not well understood .
