major depressive disorder ( mdd ) is an illness with significant neurobiological consequences involving structural , functional and molecular alterations in several areas of the brain .
the search strategies used for this review involved literature searches of the medline and psychinfo electronic databases .
the main heading terms included major depressive disorder , neurobiology , antidepressant , hippocampus , brain - derived neurotrophic growth factor , glucocorticoids and monoamines .
clinicians are advised to intervene with mdd using an early , comprehensive treatment approach that has remission as the goal .
chemical imbalance in the brain , this body of research has developed into a complex theory involving neuronal networks and plasticity ( 3 ) . the network model has also led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of effective treatment interventions and their role in mitigating the deleterious effects of mdd ( 4 ) .
once remission is attained , maintenance of effect may become the more appropriate term , rather than relapse prevention , to emphasise the necessity for an ongoing collaboration between patient and physician in order to maintain neurobiological homeostasis .
as the underlying neurobiological model of depression is increasingly understood , treatment providers are directed to recognise that the factors that may initiate a mdd episode and those that maintain the illness are likely to be very different .
