the aim of the study was to investigate the evolution of antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution of s.  pneumoniae in infections in children in algeria .
continuous national monitoring of ipd and nasopharyngeal carriage as well as judicious use of antibiotics are crucial before and after pcv implementation in order to evaluate the effect of vaccination and to prevent the selection of multidrug - resistant clones .
after meningitis isolates , the next highest rate of penicillin - nonsusceptible s.  pneumoniae ( pnsp ) was observed in the isolates from nipd . from all the invasive isolates ( n  =  97 )
the prevalence of penicillin resistance among pneumococcal disease isolates in algeria , which was measured by the oxacillin disc diffusion method , appears to have increased over the years , from 34.6% in 19952000 to 48.1% in 20052012 ( current study )   .
from the 270 isolates collected ( ipd n  =  97 , nipd n  =  173 ) , 197 ( 73.0% ) were from children < 5 years , of whom 151 ( 76.7% ) were < 2 years . among the isolates from children with ipd ,
the non - ipd isolates were from ear , nose and throat infections ( n  =  91 ) , bronchopulmonary infections ( n  =  77 ) and other suppurative infections ( n  =  5 ) . among the isolates from children with nipd ,
