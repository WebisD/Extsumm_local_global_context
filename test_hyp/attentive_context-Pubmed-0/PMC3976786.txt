the results of this study are relevant to an initiative by the ministry of health in botswana to eliminate malaria by year 2016 .
the study was conducted in the context of a larger project , botswana ecohealth project ( bep ) , which is investigating the impacts of hydroclimate change on population health . apart from contributing towards the objectives of bep ,
the overwhelming use of mosquito nets treated , untreated , or home - made proved to be a viable tool for malaria control in the village .
in conclusion , socioeconomic status , exposure to mosquito bites through individual nocturnal outdoor activities , and mobility of the community were identified as high risk factors for malaria transmission in tubu village .
limited use of malaria protective measures such as insecticide treated nets , house structure ( traditional or modern ) , and close location of homesteads in relation to breeding sites exposed individuals to mosquito bites .
this is particularly true for children , pregnant women , and older people , who form the high risk groups .
children who reported spending at least one night per month in a rural area endemic to malaria were found to be at risk of contracting infections , indicating that exposure during rural travel was an important element of risk .
