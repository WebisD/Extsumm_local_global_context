the microstructures and morphologies of 
 the nanostructures are 
 characterized by a jeol 6700 scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .
the 
 cross - sectional image of the heterostructure device is obtained by 
 an fei titan transmission electron microscope ( tem ) .
to fabricate the 
 vertical wse2/mos2 heterojunction 
 devices , wse2 was grown using a physical vapor deposition 
 process on a si / sio2 ( 300 nm sio2 ) substrate . 

the metal electrodes 
 ( for probe contact or wire bonding purposes ) were patterned on the 
 si / sio2 substrates by using electron - beam lithography and 
 electron - beam deposition of ti / au ( 50/50 nm ) thin film .
the mos2 flakes were then exfoliated onto the wse2 flakes 
 through a micromechanical cleavage approach .
the dc electrical 
 transport measurements were conducted with a lakeshore probe station 
 ( model ttp4 ) and a computer - controlled analogue - to - digital converter 
 ( national instruments model 6030e ) .
the scanning photocurrent measurements were conducted 
 with the same horiba labhr confocal raman system combined with the 
 same electrical measurement system .
the confocal micro - pl and raman 
 measurements were conducted on a horiba labhr confocal raman system 
 with 600 g / mm grating , 50 diffraction - limited objective ( n.a .
