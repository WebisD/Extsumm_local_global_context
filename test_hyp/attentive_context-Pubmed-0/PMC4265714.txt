, we analyzed the location of the psm and its association with the bcr rate in patients who had undergone four different types of rp in a single center .
the median follow - up of each operative group was 67.7 months ( iqr , 40.7 - 90.9 months ) for rpp , 45.9 months ( iqr , 32.4 - 64.4 months ) for rrp , 41.4 months ( iqr , 27.5 - 55.8 months ) for lrp , and 43.5 months ( iqr , 32.4 - 55.5 months ) for ralrp ( p<0.001 ) .
the bcr rate according to the location of the psm also did not show a significant difference in the kaplan - meier survival analysis for the four types of surgery ( p=0.694 , p=0.301 , p=0.445 , and p=0.309 for rpp , rrp , lrp , and ralrp , respectively ) ( fig .
the bcr rate also showed no significant difference according to the location of the psm in each type of rp .
cases with a psm showed a higher bcr rate than did cases with a negative surgical margin ( p=0.04 ) . in the psm group ,
the total number of cases of bcr was 390 ( 20.7% ) , with 181 cases ( 28.5% ) in the rpp group , 81 ( 26.2% ) in the rrp group , 24 ( 14.6% ) in the lrp group , and 104 ( 13.4% ) in the ralrp group .
