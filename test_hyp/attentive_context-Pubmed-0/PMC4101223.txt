the results of this initial study indicate that the oral administration of a novel , triketonic phenylamino carbonyl curcumin ( cmc 2.24 ) , to rats with endotoxin- ( lps- ) induced periodontitis , is a significant and potent inhibitor of both pathologic alveolar bone loss and its inflammatory and collagen - destructive mediators .
accordingly , the current report describes the first of a series of studies which examined the efficacy of cmc 2.24 as a pleiotropic mmp - i in several rat models of periodontitis with a particular focus on its ability to inhibit pathologic alveolar bone loss .
moreover , because of the long - standing interest in the link between the oral disease , periodontitis , and systemic inflammation ( the latter associated with increased risk for various diseases , notably cardiovascular disease and more severe diabetes   ) , the effects of treatment with this novel compound on biomarkers in the circulation were also examined .
studies are now underway to expand these observations in additional rat models of experimental inflammatory periodontal disease with a particular focus on cmc 2.24 effects ( i ) on the cellular mechanisms of alveolar bone loss ; ( ii ) in a model in which the test medication is administered therapeutically ( i.e. , after the disease has been established ) rather than prophylactically ; and ( iii ) on the pharmacokinetics ( such as peak blood levels ; serum half - life ) of this novel compound .
