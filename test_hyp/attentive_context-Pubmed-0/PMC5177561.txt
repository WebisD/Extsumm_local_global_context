although it is most frequently observed in the first decade of life , with 78% of the cases being diagnosed before 10 years of age,9 neonatal gf has only been reported in a single case report so far.10 in our report , we relate the cases of two patients with neonatal gf and very different findings .
continuous follow - up is mandatory because of unpredictable growth behavior and early onset of intestinal polyps .
familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) is a rare cause of colorectal cancer and is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations in the apc gene.1 
 2 fap usually presents with a 100 to 1,000 of precancerous colonic polyps . without colectomy ,
whereas early childhood gf have been reported and the assumption has been made that there is a strong connection to fap,9 to our knowledge there is only one report of a neonatal onset of gf leading to the diagnosis of fap in an otherwise asymptomatic child.10 in this report the patient 's parents were healthy and had negative genetic testing , so that a de novo mutation is most probable . in contrast , in our patient a , testing of the parents revealed the same mutation in the father and the diagnosis of abundant intestinal polyposis and sigmoid cancer in colonoscopy .
