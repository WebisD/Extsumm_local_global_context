the mean scores of doubting / checking ( case : 3.52  2.54 , control : 2.5  2.32 , p = 0.007 ) and ordering ( case : 2.59  1.81 , control : 1.5  2.56 , p = 0.005 ) of the children with ckd was significantly higher than the scores of the healthy ones .
the aim of this study was to investigate ocd in children with early stages of ckd and to compare it with healthy children .
however , the maternal educational level was significantly different between the two groups ( p = 0.001 ) , so that 30 ( 37.5% ) and 37 ( 46.25% ) of mothers in the group of the children with ckd had college and high school education , respectively , whereas 16 ( 20% ) and 50 ( 62.5% ) of the mothers in the control group had college and high school education , respectively .
moreover , the mean total scores for the oci - cv of the children with ckd at 15.32  7.69 was significantly higher than those of the healthy ones at 11.12  2.54 ( p = 0.021 ) . nevertheless , the mean scores of obsessing ( p = 0.11 ) , hoarding ( p = 0.117 ) , washing ( p = 0.211 ) , and neutralizing ( p = 0.41 ) were not significantly different between the case and control groups ( table 2 and figure 1 ) .
