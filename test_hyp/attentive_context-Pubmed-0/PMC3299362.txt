in our experience , over 90% of children with hemispheric and subhemispheric epilepsy syndromes achieve an excellent seizure outcome with less morbidity following epilepsy surgery . age of seizure onset and etiology of the disease causing epilepsy are independent predictive variables of a good seizure outcome .
following seizure freedom , improvement of function in the residual brain occurs that in turn leads to improvement in adaptive and social functions and quality of life .
we found that age of seizure onset ( p = 0.03 ) and the etiology of the disease causing epilepsy ( p = 0.007 ) were predictive variables for the same .
an analysis was done of the pre- and postsurgical data of 34 children who underwent disconnective epilepsy surgeries , that is , a peri - insular hemispherotomy ( pih ) or a peri - insular posterior quadrantectomy ( pipq ) for hemispheric / subhemispheric epilepsy from april 2000 to march 2011 .
patients who had re , sws , pes , and ihss had good seizure outcomes following surgery .
seizures are the most common neurological events of childhood with approximately 35% of children experiencing a seizure at some point in their lives 25% of whom subsequently go on to develop epilepsy .
