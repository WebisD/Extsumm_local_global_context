, we provide a brief literature review regarding the management of lumbar discal cysts and describe a new case .
although early reports had recommended discography for presurgical diagnosis of discal cysts , advances in imaging techniques , particularly in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , made the diagnosis easier and noninvasive.6 moreover , a more accurate knowledge of their origin and pathoanatomical features has more recently become available.7 
 8 although nearly all reported discal cysts treated by surgery are associated with a successful outcome , their rarity makes it impossible to draw clear conclusions about its natural course history and allow for meaningful recommendations regarding the clinical management . in this article
indeed , the definition of these lesions was a relatively recent one , with its formal description provided by chiba et al in 2001.1 
  a review of the literature revealed 37 previously published articles on lumbar discal cysts ; all reported cases demonstrate that the clinical picture determined by discal cysts is indistinguishable from other causes of low back pain and radiculopathy such as conventional disc herniations .
discal cysts are defined as intraspinal , extradural cysts with a distinct communication with the corresponding intervertebral disc.1 
 2 unlike intracanalar cystic masses , such as synovial cysts,3 that arise from the ligamentum flavum4 or from the posterior longitudinal ligament5 and may involve any spinal segment , discal cysts have only been reported in the lumbar spine .
