early surgery may even be considered in children with severe visual impairment in one eye due to band keratopathy , seclusion of the pupil by inflammatory membranes and/or dense cataract . in these cases , adequate surgical procedure of the cataract combined with intraocular lens implantation is to be considered and can result in good restoration of vision ( benezra and cohen 2000 ; khotaniemi and penttila 2006 ) .
of the 152 children with the presenting symptom of arthritis , 18 ( 11.8 % ) had the systemic type of jia , 87 ( 57.2% ) had the pauciarticular type and 47 ( 30.9% ) had the polyarticular type .
the intraocular inflammation processes were confined to the anterior segment in 45 of the 51 ( 88.2% ) affected children . in 5 of the affected children ( 9.8% ) ,
of the 152 children presenting with all types of jia arthritic manifestations , in 14 children ( 9.2% ) , the intraocular inflammation ( uveitis ) was diagnosed during the first ophthalmic examination ( 12/14 had clinical evidence for the pauciarticular type of jia ) .
noteworthy is the fact that 20 of the 51 children with jia and uveitis in our cohort presented with severe intraocular inflammation . the diagnosis of jia was made only after these children were referred specifically for pediatric examination to assess the possible presence of jia . in most of these 20 children
