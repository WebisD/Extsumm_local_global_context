the fa pattern of six sponge species and three types of reef food resources were analyzed , and the relative input of different sources to the diet of the sponges was determined .
results unambiguously point to the reef benthos as the main source of organic matter for encrusting cavity sponges on coral reefs .
the contribution of open water - derived organic matter as food for the cavity sponge community was usually less than 50% .
mean% show the contribution of plankton - derived ( gfc and gff ) and reef - derived organic matter ( cca and mucmix ) in the diet as %   dual isotope mixing model analyses of the diet of sponges the sources comprise two suspended matter size fractions , gfc ro > 1.2  m and gff ro > 0.7 and < 1.2  m from reef overlying and open water ( ro ) , cca representing crustose coralline algae and mucmix representing coral mucus of two different coral species , m. annularis and m. mirabilis .
fatty acid biomarkers have been repeatedly used as source - specific indicators of dissolved and particulate organic matter both in environmental and in food web studies ( e.g. hall et al .
