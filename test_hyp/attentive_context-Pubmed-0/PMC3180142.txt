the aim of this study was to determine the effects of simvastatin treatment on the metabolic , cardiovascular , and autonomic modulation in an experimental model of ms that was induced by long - term fructose overload ( 18 weeks ) in female rats .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin on the metabolic , cardiovascular and autonomic changes induced by fructose overload in female rats .
importantly , we demonstrated that a short - term simvastatin treatment may improve insulin sensitivity and cardiac autonomic control in an experimental model of ms in female rats .
the results of the present study demonstrate that fructose overload in female rats induces increases in the ap and the cardiac sympathetic response , which are associated with insulin resistance .
the cardiac vagal effect was similar between the c ( 499 bpm ) and f groups ( 465 bpm , p>0.05 ) .
although simvastatin treatment did not change the blood metabolic parameters or the ap , this pharmacologic approach improved insulin resistance , reduced the exacerbated cardiac sympathetic effect and increased the vagal effect to the heart .
the constant rate of the plasma glucose disappearance ( kitt ) was reduced in the f group ( 3.40.32%/min ) compared with that in the c group ( 4.40.29%/min , p<0.05 ) during itt , which is indicative of the insulin - resistant state in the fructose - fed rats .
