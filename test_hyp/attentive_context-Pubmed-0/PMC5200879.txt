we herein present a rare case of extensive skin hyperpigmentation involving both lower extremities in a patient receiving long term minocycline .
cutaneous hyperpigmentation is a recognized adverse effect of chronic minocycline use occurring in up to 50% of patients , . in a recent study performed at the mayo clinic , 54% of 291 patients receiving long - term minocycline suppression for orthopedic infections developed some degree of hyperpigmentation after a mean follow - up of 4.8 years . in this cohort ,
in june 2016 , a 76-year - old male with a past medical history significant for nephrolithiasis and diverticulitis , presented to the authors institution with extensive hyperpigmentation involving both lower extremities .
factors associated with minocycline - induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation ( mich ) include a history of vitamin d deficiency , presence of a shoulder prosthesis , noncirrhotic liver pathology , and use of a concurrent medication ( e.g. , calcium channel blocker ) also known to cause hyperpigmentation .
mich is not associated with adverse clinical effects , and it is mostly cosmetic in nature .
these side effects are an addition to gastrointestinal adverse effects that can also occur with minocycline . in the absence of data to show that minocycline is superior to doxycycline for long - term suppression of infections including orthopedic infections , the authors propose that doxycycline be looked upon favorably when chronic use is indicated .
