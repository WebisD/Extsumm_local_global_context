it is also one of the 4 classical reprogramming factors that are necessary for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells .
after all , sox2 is intimately linked in the scientific consciousness to stem cells , both embryonic and neural , where it is key to induction and maintenance of pluripotency .
sox2 is originally expressed in all blastomeres , and later in all cells of the inner cell mass and the epiblast .
its mechanistic versatility is not only basis for its central role in many regulatory networks , but also endows it with a tremendous flexibility that allows it to acquire different tasks in diverse developmental setups including maintenance of the precursor state , suppression of neurogenesis and promotion of glial differentiation .
a look into the pubmed database reveals that sox2 is one of the most studied transcription factors of recent years . in 2013 alone , there are about 750 publications mentioning sox2 in title or abstract .
these findings provide support for the assumption that at least some of the long known repressive effects of sox2 in nep cells on neurogenesis may be mediated by micrornas that are under direct or indirect control of sox2 . in our opinion , sox2 is a true central regulator of gene expression because it acts not only at the transcriptional level , but also pretranscriptionally as a chromatin - associated pioneer factor and posttranscriptionally as a microrna modulator .
