, most strictures could be managed successfully with several treatment modalities , such as direct digital dilation , transanal surgical treatment , endoscopic balloon dilation , and stent insertion
anastomotic strictures after surgery , occurring in 5% to 20% of cases after low anterior resection , could be a serious condition that may require endoscopic or surgical treatment . despite this serious condition
data on refractory cases in colorectal benign strictures are limited and this will be discussed .
. however , other varieties of endoscopic or surgical techniques are required in refractory strictures , especially after failure of the first endoscopic management .
recently , colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection has become another possible culprit for the development of this benign stricture , which usually occurs after resection of a lateral spreading tumor , occupying 75% of the lumen .
endoscopic balloon dilation has been used as a first treatment modality for the treatment of benign colorectal strictures . however , varying results have been reported with regard to the success rate of this procedure.1,2 despite its simplicity and immediate efficacy in up to 80% of cases , this technique requires several treatment sessions and is associated with a significant rate of recurrent benign stenosis .
