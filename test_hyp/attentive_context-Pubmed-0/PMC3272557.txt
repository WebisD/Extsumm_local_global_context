patients with negative findings on the eps or vb3 test ( 198 of 413 ) underwent prostate biopsy immediately ( fig .
in which the psa level is increasing , if we first exclude prostatitis and carry out a serial diagnostic procedure , it may help to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsy .
the mean age was significantly different between the positive group ( 65.0 ) and the negative group ( 71.2 ) .
the aim of our study was to investigate the possibility of reducing the number of prostate biopsies in patients with a high psa level showing a psa decrease or normalization after antibiotic therapy .
the total prostate cancer detection rate was 11.6% in our subjects , whereas it was 20.7% in the patients with negative findings on the eps or vb3 test and 3.3% in those with positive findings , respectively .
of the 215 patients , 53 men avoided prostate biopsy because their serum psa level had decreased to less than 4 ng / ml . the other patients ( 162 of 215 ) still had an elevated serum psa level of more than 4 ng / ml , including 7 in whom the biopsy results revealed cancer .
