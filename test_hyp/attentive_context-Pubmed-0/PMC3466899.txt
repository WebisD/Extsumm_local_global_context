we herein present a case of a supraventricular ring in a 17-year - old male , who presented with syncope .
preoperative identification of a supravalvular mitral ring is the target for obtaining good surgical results . for the identification of this congenital heart disease ,
however , turbulence can cause a progressive increase in the supravalvar membrane or ridge thickness , worsening mitral inflow obstruction.3 the same mechanism is responsible for the acquired variety of supravalvar mitral stenosis , which occurs after mitral annuloplasty for the repair of mitral regurgitation .
about 15 years ago , he had undergone a cardiac operation for ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) closure and mitral valve repair . in chest x - ray
supravalvar mitral ring is a circumferential ridge or membrane arising from the left atrial wall overlying the mitral valve and frequently attached to the mitral valve.1 variable in thickness and extent , the ring ranges from a thin membrane to a thick discrete fibrous ridge.2 the membranous variety may be difficult to detect because the membrane often adheres to the anterior mitral valve leaflet while remaining just proximal to the posterior mitral leaflet .
supravalvar mitral ring rarely occurs as an isolated defect ; other congenital heart defects coexist in 90% of patients .
