several studies have proposed the potential increase in thyroid malignancies with rai treatment [ 2 - 4 ] . here , we describe a very rare case of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( atc ) associated with graves ' disease , following rai treatment .
the treatment options for graves ' disease consist of antithyroid drugs , radioactive iodine ( rai ) therapy , and surgery .
nevertheless , this report is worthwhile since it presents a very rare case of atc that occurred 11 years after rai therapy for graves ' disease .
rai therapy has been used for the treatment of graves ' disease for more than seven decades , and in most studies , it has not been associated with an increased risk of cancer . on the other hand ,
the patient in this case received rai therapy twice for recurrent hyperthyroidism . after more than 10 years , she developed respiratory symptoms and was finally diagnosed with atc .
this case raises questions about the causal relationship between rai therapy for graves ' disease and the subsequent occurrence of thyroid cancer .
it is not clear that the occurrence of atc reported here was influenced by rai therapy or , alternatively , it may only represent the delayed recognition of a rare change in the natural history of graves ' disease .
