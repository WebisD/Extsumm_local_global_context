acth : adrenocorticotropic hormone ; avp : arginine vasopressin ; circi : critical illness - related corticosteroid insufficiency ; crh : corticotropin - releasing hormone ; dhea : dehydroepiandrosterone ; hpa : hypothalamic - pituitaryadrenal ; pct : procalcitonin ; rai : relative adrenal insufficiency ; sdf-1 : stromal cell - derived factor-1-alpha .
in this issue of critical care , lesur and colleagues   report the differential profile of stress response in septic and non - septic patients .
, the study by lesur and colleagues undoubtedly expands our understanding of the complex neuroendocrine network regulating hpa stress response in human sepsis .
we believe that further investigation into the mechanism is warranted before we plan a successful strategy for corticosteroid replacement in sepsis .
this effect is termed relative adrenal insufficiency ( rai ) , also known as critical illness - related corticosteroid insufficiency ( circi ) .
the response of hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis to the sustained stress of severe illness has been the focus of many studies in recent years . in healthy subjects , cortisol secretion by adrenal cortex
the dissociation of acth and cortisol levels observed in the study is more compatible with neuroendocrine characteristics of prolonged critical illness , although the authors claimed to include patients within the first 24 hours of admission .
