we examined the role reduced metabolism has on the hair preservative effect of scalp cooling . for this , a controlled in vitro experiment was conducted to assess the damage exerted by doxorubicin on human epidermal keratinocytes for a range of chemotherapy concentrations and exposure temperatures .
the reduced temperature caused by scalp cooling will result in lower perfusion and a lower cellular metabolism . with this , the supply , uptake and damage of a chemotherapeutic agent will be diminished . for low doxorubicin concentrations ( 0.01 and 0.04  g ml )
the goal of the experiments was to assess the effects of temperature and chemotherapy on keratinocyte survival .
the effects of temperature and doxorubicin on cell damage were determined from cell viability measurements ( mtt assay ) .
viability was close to 1 for low concentrations and close to 0 for high concentrations . in between
the findings of the current study indicate that there is no difference in cell survival between 22 c and 10 c. based on these findings , we can conclude that there is an optimal temperature in scalp cooling .
the increased effect of reduced temperature was significant for doxorubicin concentrations of 0.1  g ml and higher .
