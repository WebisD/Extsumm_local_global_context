visual memory is weaker in children with adhd and these children perform weaker than normal children in both visual and auditory symbols at presentation durations of 50 and 100 ms .
the meansd scores of visual and auditory symbols were 27.481.36 and 27.751.67 , respectively ( p
the mean scores of the children with adhd increased as the duration of the presentation increased from 50 ms ( 25.361.46 ) to 100 ms ( 29.861.43 ) to 300 ms ( 31.501.62 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . 
  meansd scores of visual and auditory symbols at different durations of stimulation we found a non - linear relationship between the two different groups with respect to the number of correct answers at different durations of stimulation .
as the duration of stimulation increased from 50 ms to 100 ms , the number of correct answers had a higher increase in the experimental group compared with the comparison group .
children with and without adhd differed significantly with respect to auditory presentations time of 50 and 100 ms .
moreover , the performance of the experimental group differed significantly when the duration of the presentation differed from 50 ms to 100 ms as compared with the comparision group ( p < 0.001 ) .
