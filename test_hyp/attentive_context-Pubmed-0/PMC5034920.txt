the background reduces the sensitivities of the green and red cones , thus isolating the short wavelength - sensitive blue cones and their associated small , bistratified retinal ganglion cells.6 the purposes of the study are to assess the role and diagnostic ability of oct and swap to distinguish between normal , glaucoma suspects , and surely diagnosed glaucomatous eye .
both rnfl thickness measured by oct and swap indices are good discrimination tools between glaucomatous , glaucoma suspect , and normal eyes .
there is superior ability of swap over sap in detecting glaucomatous changes in glaucoma suspect group .
inferior and superior quadrants thickness showed a highly statistically significant correlation with md ( 0.252 and 0.173 ; p=0.001 ) and psd ( 0.416 and 0.134 ; p=0.001 and 0.004 ) .
is a noninvasive imaging modality that uses low - coherence light to obtain a high - resolution cross - section of anterior and posterior segments of the eye and quantitative assessments of different layers.5 short wave  automated perimetry ( swap ) is more sensitive to early glaucoma than standard perimetry.6 with swap , a large goldmann size v blue target is projected against a bright yellow background .
