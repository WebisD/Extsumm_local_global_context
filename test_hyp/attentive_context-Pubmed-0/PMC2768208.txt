induced retinal vasodilation in individuals with diabetes and , among those with diabetes , in those with retinopathy signs .
however , the association of reduced flicker light  induced vasodilation with diabetic retinopathy was stronger in participants with type 1 diabetes ( arteriolar dilation or 3.1 [ 95% ci 1.18.5 ] ; venular dilation or 3.8 [ 95% ci 1.410.0 ] ) compared with those with type 2 diabetes ( arteriolar dilation or 1.8 [ 95% ci 0.84.0 ] ; venular dilation or 1.3 [ 95% ci 0.63.1 ] ) , although the interaction with type of diabetes was not statistically significant ( p value for interaction term : p = 0.50 for arteriolar dilation and p = 0.09 for venular dilation ) .
in this study , we demonstrated a reduction in flicker light  induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation in individuals with diabetes compared with nondiabetic control subjects and , among individuals with diabetes , in those with retinopathy signs .
induced venular dilation was 2.83  2.10% in individuals with diabetes and 3.98  1.84% in normal control subjects ( p < 0.001 after multivariable adjustment ) and again was not significantly different by type of diabetes : 2.84% in those with type 1 and 2.83% in those with type 2 diabetes ( p = 0.99 ) . mean differences in flicker light  induced vasodilation between participants with diabetes and normal control subjects and by grades of diabetic retinopathy severity in participants with diabetes * adjustment for age , sex , fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels , use of antihypertensive and lipid - lowering medications , current smoking status , and fasting glucose ( for analysis of diabetic retinopathy severity ) .
