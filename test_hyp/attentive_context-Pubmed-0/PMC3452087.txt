we report a case of sunct with onset in adolescence in a patient with unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia ( onh ) and mild hypothalamic - pituitary dysfunction .
short - lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing ( sunct ) was first described in 1978 with diagnostic criteria established in 2004   .
congenital abnormality of the hypothalamic - pituitary axis may also explain the onset of this headache syndrome in adolescence .
a 27-year - old caucasian woman with a history of left onh diagnosed before 2  years of age was seen for evaluation of brief head pains .
sunct has been reported in association with acquired and congenital abnormalities of the brainstem and pituitary region .
we hypothesize that there is an association between sunct headaches and the mild , hypothalamic - pituitary dysfunction in our patient .
sunct and suna are classified as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias along with cluster headaches , and paroxysmal hemicrania with all of these headache syndromes sharing unilateral headache pain in a v1 trigeminal distribution and ipsilateral activation of cranial parasympathetics .
if associated with other cranial autonomic symptoms or without both conjunctival injection and tearing , the syndrome is classified as suna ( short - lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic features ) .
