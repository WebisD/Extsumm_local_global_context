two studies were designed to evaluate the clinical 
 profile of a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-based vaccine given 
 as a single dose by respiratory or sublingual ( sl ) administration 
 to non - human primates ( nhp ) .
while this 
 fast - acting platform clearly holds promise for people in high - risk 
 settings who may have already been exposed to ebola , the longevity 
 of the immune response elicited by the vaccine has only just been 
 evaluated in rodent models of infection . a second vaccine candidate , a bivalent recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus 
 serotype 3 virus expressing the glycoproteins of both ebola and sudan 
 species , the most lethal of the known ebola viruses , is also undergoing clinical testing .
the ongoing epidemic in west africa is the largest 
 ebola outbreak 
 ever recorded and is rapidly crossing borders . in response to this 
 public health crisis , the who has supported a movement to initiate 
 small phase i clinical trials of vaccine candidates that have successfully 
 prevented non - human primates from developing ebola virus disease after 
 exposure to a lethal dose of the virus .
the overall goal of these studies was to identify an immunization 
 platform that is easy to administer and capable of eliciting long - term 
 protection from ebola infection . using results generated in mouse 
 and guinea pig models ,
