this dose was already lethal on its own . in the hamster model at a lower dose ( 50 mg / kg ) combined with doxycycline and azithromycin  which together provide broad - spectrum antimicrobial coverage , in addition to doxycycline having a small antiviral effect against ebov 
despite some activity of chloroquine against ebov in vitro , we observed no benefit to its administration in the mouse and hamster models . in the mouse model ,
thus , current preclinical data do not support the continued consideration of chloroquine for use against ebov infections in humans .
reperfusion injury of the gut after ebov disease , which would subsequently result in bacterial sepsis , has been suspected as a possible cause of death .
previous anecdotal reports of the incidental use of chloroquine in patients with filovirus infections also do not support any benefit from its use ( 13,14 ) .
a dose of 90 mg / kg resulted in toxicity but did not alter survival ; therefore , higher concentrations of chloroquine in the mouse would not be expected to be possible . in the hamsters ,
given its in vitro activity against many different viruses and its longstanding use in humans , chloroquine has been put into multiple clinical trials . during dengue virus infection ,
