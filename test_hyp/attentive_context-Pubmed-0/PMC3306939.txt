the observation of ps exposure as a strategy to evade the immune system and persist in the mammalian host , made initially in the experimental model of l. amazonensis infection , was a breakthrough since it stimulated different groups around the world to look for the possibilities for basic and applied research on the field .
our group is still studying the immunological , cellular , and molecular mechanisms underlying control of ps exposure in parasites and the effects of its recognition by parasitized cells and organisms .
we believe that this could be a major strategy in different systems where avoidance from immune surveillance is necessary to establish a disease .
the determinants of dcl are multifactorial and may be associated with both immunologic and genetic events of the patient and the pathogenic factors related to the parasite and vector .
there are two main groups of parasites , stratified upon the clinical outcome of the infection : the ones capable of causing tegumentar and the ones capable of causing visceral diseases . in both cases ,
the outcome of the infection is dependent on multiple , interdependent factors , such as vector species , parasite species and strain , genetic background , and immunological status of the host .
