. we present a case of spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma ( rsh ) during rivaroxaban therapy for atrial fibrillation in an elderly female patient .
a 75-year - old woman presented to the emergency department with the complaints of fatigue and abdominal pain after coughing .
several case reports of muscle hematoma due to the antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents have been reported previously , but this is the first reported case of spontaneous rsh due to the rivaroxaban .
recently , new oral anticoagulants have been approved as alternatives to warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation .
there are some advantages of the new agents compared with warfarin including rapid anticoagulation after an oral dose and lack of dietary or drug - drug interaction . however , there are no specific antidotes for the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in the event of a major bleeding , unlike warfarin
rivaroxaban is one of the novel anticoagulants , which is an oxazolidinone derivative and inhibits both free factor xa and factor xa bound with the prothrombinase complex .
it is a highly selective direct factor xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability and rapid onset of action .
after the first treatment , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit ( icu ) .
