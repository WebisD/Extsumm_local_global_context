the chinese patient s disease began at 17 years of age , and his predominant symptoms were tremor and rigidity . it is presumed that modifier effects of allelic genes and environmental factors played a roll in the phenotypic differences between these two patients.3 the pank2 gene codes for pantothenate kinase , which is an essential regulatory enzyme in coenzyme a ( coa ) biosynthesis , catalyzing the cytosolic phosphorylation of pantothenate ( vitamin b5 ) the enzyme of the initial and rate - limiting step in coa biosynthesis : the phosphorylation of pantothenate , n - pantothenoyl - cysteine and pantetheine.9 to compensate for the partial enzymatic deficiency in patients with pkan , supplement of pantothenate ( vitamin b5 ) have been tried without conclusive benefit.3 previous case reports using pallidal deep - brain stimulation reported improvement of dystonia in patients with pkan , but it was also restrictive effect.10 further study is needed for early diagnosis of pkan , correct prediction of disease progress , and rational treatment .
a 40-year - old man presented with involuntary movement of his right hand and left foot .
our patient had an atypical phenotype of the pank2 gene : compound heterozygous mutations in exon 3 ( p.d268 g ) and exon 4 ( p.r330p ) . to our knowledge
