composite resin curing by the 4 light curing methods provided decreasing means of microhardness in relation to the surface , according to the increase in depths analyzed ; 2 .
application of this test in depth as a parameter for analysis of curing is justified , since studies have indicated a good correlation between the knoop hardness number ( khn = kg / mm ) and infrared light spectroscopy , a direct method that evaluates the degree of conversion of monomers6 . the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effect of four light - curing techniques on the depth of cure of a composite resin by microhardness testing .
at the depth corresponding to the resin increment recommended by the manufacturer ( 2.0 mm ) , all curing techniques provided satisfactory composite hardness ; 3 .
the use of initial low light intensity for curing composite resins does not compromise the microhardness up to 2.0 mm depth .
a factorial study 44 was conducted and the factors under study were cure technique at 4 levels : traditional / continuous ( t ) , ramped ( r ) , stepped ( s ) and pulse - delay ( pd ) , and depth of cure at 4 levels 0.1 , 1.0 , 2.0 and 4.0 mm from the lighted surface , resulting in 16 groups .
