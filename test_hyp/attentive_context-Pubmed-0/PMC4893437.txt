the circadian system is a supraphysiological system which modulates different physiological systems , and any alteration of this can have a negative impact on human health .
but it has been described that the genetic component in the population predisposes the development of different pathologies such as diabetes , dyslipidemias , obesity , mood disorders , and addiction , all of which suggest the importance of this system to our health .
this present research reports the last single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) associated with an elevated risk of developing principal pathologies worldwide such as mood disorder , infertility , cancer , metabolism and diabetes   and addictions , and a description of usefulness for a more detailed study in other pathologies .
however , it is also necessary to say that the genetic component could be protecting our health such as in the case of polymorphisms associated with per2 and cry2 genes in diabetes , alcohol intake , and cancer . these findings will need to be implemented and evaluated at the genetic interaction level and also the way in which the environment factors trigger the expression of these pathologies will be examined .
different chronodisruptors have been described in literature such as light / dark pattern and inhibition of melatonin production as occurs in shifts work .
