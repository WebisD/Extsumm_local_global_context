while this study has identified qis and quality improvement mechanisms to assess care quality for dementia , findings underscore the importance of system integration for the provision of quality dementia care , with specifically defined and mutually understood roles among stakeholders and , where necessary , the reallocation of existing resources to support this approach to care .
this paper describes the results of a consensus approach to identify qis and quality improvement mechanisms in an ontario - wide network of interprofessional pcmcs , and identify potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a quality assurance framework .
an approach whereby clear roles are negotiated among dementia stakeholders can provide sufficient flexibility to meet regional needs ( especially in rural areas where access to specialists is more limited ) , foster more effective collaboration and accountability , and thus facilitate the delivery and measurement of care quality for dementia . within that context , proper field - testing , validation , and evaluation of selected qis and quality improvement mechanisms
links to the web - based survey were electronically distributed to all pcmc clinicians ( n = 283 ) and ontario specialists through the ontario medical association sections of geriatric medicine ( n = 123 ) and neurologists ( n = 134 ) , and the canadian association of geriatric psychiatrists ( n = 305 ) .
