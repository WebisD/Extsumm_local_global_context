the present study was an attempt to assess the usefulness of serum pct as a marker of sepsis in critically ill patients , using the semi - quantitative , rapid immunochromatographic kit , in apollo hospitals , bangalore .
serum pct cut - offs of 0.5 ng / ml and 2 ng / ml were analyzed separately for their sensitivity and specificity as biomarkers for sepsis among the 21 patients with sepsis and 19 patients without sepsis .
serum procalcitonin values in the 40 patients with suspected sepsis among the 12 patients with pct > 10 ng / ml , 1 patient in shock did not have any signs of sepsis or infection and recovered with inotropic support only ( no antibiotics were required ; cardiogenic shock )
there was a statistically significant correlation with the presence of sepsis determined using either pct 0.5 ng / ml or 2 ng / ml ( p<0.0001 in both cases ) . using 0.5 ng / ml or more as cut - off , 19 of the 21 patients with sepsis could be detected , but 3 out of the 19 patients without sepsis showed pct above 0.5 ng / ml ( sensitivity , 90% , i.e. , 19/19 + 2 ; and specificity , 84% , i.e. , 16/16 + 3 ) .
