the objective of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of sodium and calcium salts on spore production , conidia germination , and mycelial growth of b. cinerea .
the purpose of this study was to compare the effect of sodium and calcium salts against b. cinerea .
our in vitro tests showed that sodium chloride stimulates the development of the fungal up to 150  ppm .
regragui and lahlou   showed that the stimulator effect of salinity was observed on the mycelial growth , conidia production , and conidia germination of the tested stain of v. dahliae , respectively , in concentrations 170 , 120 , and 256  mm of nacl .
similarly ,   showed that all calcium salts tested ( except formate , calcium pantothenate , and dibasic calcium phosphate ) reduced the growth of monilia fructicola responsible for brown rot of peach , on amended potato dextrose agar ( pda ) . in the comparison of the inhibitory effect of the various salts , higher concentrations with 300  ppm to nacl or cacl2 reduced mycelial growth to 16 and 23% , respectively .
the effects of calcium in reducing spore germination were probably due to toxicity , with high concentrations likely affecting the osmotic balance in fungal cells .
