ureteritis cystica ( uc ) is usually suspected when defects of filling are seen in the ureter in contrasted images of the urinary tract .
although is the condition is usually an incidental finding during the evaluation of the urinary tract , it presents occasionally with acute flank pain .
a biopsy was negative for cancer . with the presumptive diagnosis of ureteritis cystica , we opted for observation with annual follow - up .
imaging studies should be complemented with ureteroscopy and biopsy when indicated when tumour is suspected .
cytology of the ureteral washings was also negative for malignant cells . to further refine the diagnosis computerized axial tomography ( ct ) and urological magnetic resonance ( mru )
bilateral renal morphology and function were normal including a normal left ureter . in the distal right ureter
both studies showed that the right ureter was occupied from the crossing of the iliac vessels to the bladder by material with characteristics soft tissue .
there was no evidence of retroperitoneal , iliac or inguinal lymphadenopathy , or hepatic lesions ( figs . 2 and 3 ) . in view of these findings
other lesion that can have a similar appearance include , ( radiolucent stones , clots , veins , air bubbles , tuberculous ureteritis).8 when the imaging studies are not conclusive , ureteroscopy plays a fundamental roll in the ability to directly visualize the cystic formations and to take biopsies in order to realize an anatomo - pathological analysis.7 in fact , many authors consider endoscopic diagnosis as the most appropriate in these cases.6 the treatment consists of eliminating the process which is causing the inflammation ( infection , lithiasis ) , although in those cases in which obstruction other measures may be appropriate . in table 1
