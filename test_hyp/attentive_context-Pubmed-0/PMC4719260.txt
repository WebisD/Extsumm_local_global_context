the visible clips were present from the primary surgery and were used to tag the abductor repair case 1 : postoperative radiograph showing a cable plate applied to support a distal peri - prosthetic fracture case 2 : radiograph showing fracture through an echelon stem just distal to the extended trochanteric osteotomy site case 2 : post - operative follow - up radiograph we report 3 cases of uncemented revision stem fractures .
fracture of stems in primary cemented hip arthroplasty is a known complication and has been attributed to varus positioning , excessive weight of the patient , resorbtion of the femoral calcar and failure of the cement mantle .
attribute this to reduction in proximal support either in the form of bone loss or an extended trochanteric osteotomy [ eto ] against a distally well - fixed stem .
reconstruction of the femoral offset during revision hip arthroplasty is important for maintaining the stability of the joint .
x - rays of patients , which have the above , mentioned risk factors should be closely scrutinized as early diagnosis of impending failure can make revision surgery less difficult .
we summarize the variables affecting our patients especially regarding poor proximal support and small size of stems .
