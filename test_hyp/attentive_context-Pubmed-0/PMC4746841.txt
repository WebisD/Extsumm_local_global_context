we present a case of asymptomatic radioiodine - avid renal and brain metastases presenting 20 years after hemi - thyroidectomy for adenomatous goiter and identified with i - whole body scintigraphy ( wbs ) and i single photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography ( i - spect / ct ) .
metastatic dtc should be suspected in asymptomatic patients with incidentally detected lesions , raised serum tg and history of thyroid lesions .
a 65-year - old man , investigated at a different hospital for intermittent cough and white - colored expectoration for 4 months , was found to have multiple bilateral nodular lesions on a chest x - ray [ figure 1a ] and a hyperdense lesion ( arrow ) in the right posterior parietal lobe of the brain on ct [ figure 1b ] .
papillary and follicular carcinomas of the thyroid gland , commonly referred to together as differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( dtc ) , are characterized by a slowly progressive course , and a 10-year survival rate as high as 80 - 95% .
the most common site of distant metastases is the lung , followed by the bone .
the reported incidence of renal involvement from a primary thyroid malignancy is very rare , being only about 4.5 - 5.9% , whereas of all secondary metastases to the kidneys from all cancers , thyroid cancer constitutes only about 2.5 - 2.7% . so far ,
