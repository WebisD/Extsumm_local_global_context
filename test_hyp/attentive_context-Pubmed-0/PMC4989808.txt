we conducted this clinical observational study to demonstrate the feasibility and the reliability of submandibular tracheal intubation as an alternative method for airway management in such situations .
in patients with complex maxillofacial injuries undergoing corrective surgery , when oral or nasal intubation is not possible or acceptable , submandibular intubation is an effective and acceptable alternative technique to short - term tracheostomy and is associated with small risk potential .
one patient had post - operative superficial infection that responded well to local treatment and recovered completely after 3 - 4 days .
there is a need to emphasise its regular application in such cases so that technique can be mastered by both surgeons and anaesthesiologist .
eight out of ten patients had panfacial fractures with two having associated fracture of the base of the skull .
maxillofacial and mandibular fracture patients are common in the emergency department of a referral hospital .
oro - tracheal intubation may not only obstruct surgical field but can also make immediate maxillomandibular fixation impossible . an elective short - term tracheostomy just before the operation is an alternative but it is associated with its own set of complications , especially in children , or may be contraindicated in cases of cervical spine injury patients and those with neck mass at the operative site .
