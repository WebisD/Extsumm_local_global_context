therefore , the aim of this study was to analyze the maxillary sinus dimensions both linearly and volumetrically to assess the maxillary sinus pneumatization .
cbct showed a great potential for proper preoperative planning and is an indispensable alternative for ct when 3d imaging is mandatory for all dental practitioners .
the 3d volumetric measurements of the maxillary sinus obtained for only five patients using the simplant software highly correlated with the mathematically obtained volumes by the geometric calculation ( 0.98 for the right and 0.96 for left side ) .
the geometric method for volumetric analysis offered a much cheaper , easier , and less sophisticated substitute ; therefore , with the availability of software , 3d volumetric measurements are more facilitated .
there was a high correlation between the linear measurements of the right and left sides , where the antroposterior extension of the sinus at level of the nasal floor had the largest correlation ( r  =  0.89 ) .
their frequency of close proximity between the roots of the posterior maxillary teeth and the sinus floor was 45.5% for the 2nd molars , 30.4% for the 1st molars , and 19.7% for the 2nd premolars .
