the investigation of additional snps and genes that may contribute to malaria resistance , especially those involved in the human immune response , could help to distinguish between the above hypotheses .
genotype and allelea frequencies in 18 populations from lowlands and highlands of nepal frequency of the protective alleles g and c at tnf and fcgriia , respectively p values after testing for departure from hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( random association of alleles in diploid individuals ) the populations in bold live in the malarial lowlands of nepal .
we have therefore examined the frequency of seven malaria - protective snps in 928 healthy individuals from different parts of nepal in order to investigate whether known african protective alleles also confer resistance in asia . by comparing populations living successfully in malaria - endemic lowland regions , and thus resistant to the disease , with those from malaria - free highland regions
, we could investigate the contribution these alleles make to malaria resistance in this region .
the remaining groups live in regions of high altitudes , which are malaria - free finally , we assessed whether or not the inter - population diversity between groups living in malaria - free regions and those exposed to the disease varied significantly . by means of amova , we found that 91% and 95% of the entire variation at rs1800629 ( tnf ) and rs1801274 ( fcgriia ) , respectively , was observed within populations .
