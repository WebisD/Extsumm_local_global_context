it is known that 9095% of all cancers are caused by or closely associated with environmental factors and lifestyle .
the genotoxicity leading to carcinogenesis has been extensively reviewed in recent years       . in this present review , aside from a brief overview on the genotoxic effects of cigarette smoke components , we will provide a more extensive review on the non - genotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis by cigarette smoke or its components .
the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) identified cigarette smoking as the cause of cancer in more organ sites than any other human carcinogens .
in addition to all these noncancer diseases , it is also highly associated with human cancer development .
we have provided an overview on the major concepts and insights on the molecular mechanisms involved in cigarette smoke - induced cancers .
in addition , multiple signaling pathways may also be deregulated during the process of cancer development . cancer growth also requires molecular changes that either affect the tumor cells themselves or alter the interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding stromal environment or the immune system .
it is hoped that these mechanistic insights can be translated into practical applications for the prevention and treatment of cigarette smoke - related cancers .
