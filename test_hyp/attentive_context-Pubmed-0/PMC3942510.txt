, we explore the potential role of the evolutionary conserved bacterial proteins in the production of autoantibodies with focus on granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( gpa ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) .
autoimmune diseases are complex immune - mediated diseases that involve both genetic and environmental factors in their pathogenesis .
the concept of molecular mimicry has often been used to describe similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar proteins , as illustrated by the -helical coiled - coil streptococcal m protein and cardiac myosin in rheumatic fever . however , some proteins such as heat shock proteins are evolutionally highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes . in this review
understanding the mechanisms that deselect auto - reactive b cell clones during the germinal center reaction to homologous foreign antigens may provide a novel strategy to treat autoimmune diseases .
molecular mimicry is a mechanism that has a proposed role in many autoimmune diseases such as acute rheumatic fever , rheumatoid arthritis , guillain - barr syndrome , multiple sclerosis , type 1 diabetes mellitus , and lyme arthritis . in autoimmune diseases ,
infectious microorganisms have long been suggested to trigger an immune response to autoantigens by providing stimuli for the breakdown of self - tolerance and also by generating cross - reactive t cells and antibodies via molecular mimicry .
