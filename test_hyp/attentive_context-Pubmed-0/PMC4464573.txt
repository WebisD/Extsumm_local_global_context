adjusting for all other factors , cancer history ( or = 1.51 , 95%ci = 1.32 - 1.73 ) ; moderate alcohol drinking ( or = 1.16 , 95%ci = 1.01 - 1.30 ) ; past smoking ( or = 1.17 , 95%ci = 1.04 - 1.32 ) ; depression ( or = 1.37 , 95%ci = 1.18 - 1.58 ) ; aa race ( or = 1.74 , 95% ci = 1.53 - 1.98 ) and insomnia ( or = 1.18 , 95%ci = 1.06 - 1.32 ) were all positively associated with crc screening .
in the combined analysis , increasing age , high income , being male , depression , insomnia , past smoking , moderate alcohol drinking , and aa race were all associated with increased crc screening .
females ( or = 0.73 ; 95% ci = 0.66 - 0.82 ) and single ( or = 0.78 , 95% ci = 0.66 - 0.91 ) were inversely associated with crc screening prevalence . compared to young adults ( 18 - 44 years ) ,
may influence crc screening uptake differently between whites and aas . to improve overall crc screening uptake in the us ,
