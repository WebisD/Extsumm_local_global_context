rt - cgm hopefuls reported significantly poorer well - being ( p < .001 ) , greater hypoglycemic fear ( p < .05 ) , and more overall diabetes distress ( p
group differences on psychosocial and hypoglycemia variables , current rt - cgm users compared to rt - cgm hopefuls .
thus , restrictive access to rt - cgm due to lack of medicare coverage may have significant deleterious health , economic , and qol consequences in this population .
indeed , from the rt - cgm current users group , we informally surveyed a small number of their physicians ( n = 26 ) and found that the vast majority agreed that rt - cgm had helped their patient to achieve better control of their diabetes ( 96.2% ) and had led to an improvement in their patient s qol ( 100% ) , while all agreed that medicare should provide rt - cgm coverage in  appropriately needy patients over 65 .
current rt - cgm users were significantly more likely than rt - cgm hopefuls to report reductions over the 2 time periods in events requiring the assistance of another , er visits and paramedic visits to the home ( in all cases , p < .01 ) .
