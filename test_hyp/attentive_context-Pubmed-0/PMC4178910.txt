there were also the correlations between nag activity and the concentration of il-6 and activity of cu / zn sod and gpx .
the main findings from the study were demonstrated in figure 3 . this study can be concluded as follows : gsh , gpx , and mt seem to be the antioxidants the most involved in the defence against oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis.a significant decrease in gsh level can be a result of increased gpx and ggt activities.an increased tbars concentration and the activities of membrane or lysosomal enzymes indicate deep tissue damage , more in gallstone and idiopathic ap than in alcohol - related ap.the release of membrane and lysosomal enzymes in inflammatory process can contribute to metabolism dysfunction in nutrition and detoxification process , which can deteriorate the patient 's condition .
an increase in lipid peroxidation products in the course of ap in its severe ( 6.2 
gsh , gpx , and mt seem to be the antioxidants the most involved in the defence against oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis . a significant decrease in gsh level can be a result of increased gpx and ggt activities .
the confirmation on the significant involving of gsh in the defence against oxidative stress was the increase in tbars concentration and increased gpx activity , which correlated with a decrease in gsh level . with the development of the pancreatitis , the release of lysosomal enzymes , such as nag , was increased . its activity correlated with antioxidant enzymes activity ( gpx and cu / zn sod ) .
