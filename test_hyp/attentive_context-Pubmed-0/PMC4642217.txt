the onset of the vbm is effectively shifted upward , while minimal 
 changes are observed on the cbm , as seen in the xanes results . combining 
 xps , ups , and low - energy ion scattering spectroscopy ( leis ) , a clear 
 signature of dissociative adsorption of water
ups and leis experiments confirm that the nio activates 
 the surface toward dissociative adsorption of h2o , possibly 
 involving sites at the interface between nio patches and the substrate .
an in - gap 
 state , formed by the deposition of metallic ni onto this surface , 
 is transformed into a valence band shoulder upon oxidation of the 
 ni into nio .
this effectively increases the vbm with the cbm being 
 unchanged , as seen in xanes , and therefore decreases the band gap 
 of the system .
we have 
 performed x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) , x - ray and 
 ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps / ups ) , and scanning tunneling 
 microscopy ( stm ) to determine the effects of adsorption of nio onto 
 the sto(110)-(4  1 ) surface .
nio was prepared by either ( i ) 
 postoxidation of submonolayer amounts of ni deposited by molecular 
 beam epitaxy ( mbe ) in ultrahigh vacuum or ( ii ) reactive mbe growth 
 of metallic ni in a molecular oxygen background .
