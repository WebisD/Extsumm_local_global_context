further analyses on the cohort , considering a longer time horizon , should investigate if , as potentially suggested by the results of the analysis presented , the use of sequence analysis of hcv genotype would lead to a decrease in direct medical costs for the treatment of hcv - infected patients , due to savings for the lower number of retreated patients and lack of disease progression .
currently available genotyping methods , based on reverse hybridization with subtype - specific primers and probes targeting the 5-untranslated region ( 5-utr ) and core regions ( versant hcv genotype 2.0 system ; siemens healthcare diagnostics , milan , italy ) , as well as real - time pcr assays based on 5-utr and ns5b sequencing ( abbott hcv genotype ii assay ; abbott diagnostics , lake forest , il , usa ) , accurately differentiate major hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) genotypes in the majority of cases and are widely used because of their technical simplicity and lower costs.1 routine genotyping methods , however , may cause wrong , inaccurate , or incomplete assignment in up to 10% of cases , due to indeterminate results , mixed infections , wrong subtyping , and even wrong genotyping , as we recently reported.2 misclassifications of hcv genotype were described in characterization of genotypes 5 and 6 and in subtyping of genotypes.26 versant hcv genotype 2.0 fails to identify genotype 1 subtype in 2.2%7.4% of the cases.5 in particular , cause of misclassification was due to variability of 5-utr of hcv .
