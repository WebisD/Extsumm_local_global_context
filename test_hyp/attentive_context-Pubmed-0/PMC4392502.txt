, a pause in breathing occurs for a few seconds , and the breath returns in the expiratory phase , thereby avoiding aspiration episodes.6 
  difficulties resulting from respiratory and/or ventilatory pattern might alter this coordination , resulting in decreased protection of the lower airway as may occur in patients with copd due to ventilatory functional alterations and thoracoabdominal biomechanics , which can lead to difficulties in swallowing process called dysphagia.5 
 dysphagia refers to changes during swallowing , which may involve any of the stages of this process ; however , the alteration of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing might result in the entry of food into the airway , causing laryngeal penetration , laryngotracheal aspiration , pulmonary problems , undernutrition , dehydration , or aspiration pneumonia and might even lead to death.7

  the literature presents studies that relate copd to dysphagia , suggesting that the laryngeal aspiration phenomenon , related to the alteration in the pharyngeal phase of swallowing , contributes significantly to the exacerbation of the symptoms of lung disease,6 
 10 in addition to causing more frequent hospitalizations.11 abnormalities in the swallowing process are associated with frequent exacerbations in patients with copd.12 however , it is unclear whether these abnormalities may already be found in patients with mild degree of disease.13 
  it is known that adequate protective reflexes of the airway have an important role in the aspiration prevention , whereas the impairment in the swallowing reflex may become a potential risk factor for exacerbations of copd.10 
  the purpose of this literature review was to investigate the relation between dysphagia and exacerbations of copd .
