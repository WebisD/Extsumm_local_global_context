there have also been some cases of ulcerative colitis with prolonged remission following aza - induced pancytopenia   .
the tpmt was the wild type and this result raised doubts whether tpmt can be a reasonable screening test to identify patients with a high risk of severe myelotoxicity due to an inherited deficiency of tpmt activity . in conclusion , we report here a patient who had crohn 's colitis and complicated perianal fistulas that required immunosuppression , and who achieved endoscopically determined remission that showed accelerated mucosal healing as well as clinical remission after aza - induced pancytopenia .
a 22-year - old man with a known history of crohn 's colitis who had undergone fistulectomy for complex perianal fistula 2 years previously was admitted with a complaint of severe weight loss ( 25 kg during 2 years ) , diarrhea , abdominal pain and recurrent perianal tenderness .
a rising trend in the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) in asia has been recognized for the past two decades .
nevertheless , some reports suggested that neutropenia during aza therapy reduced the relapse rates in ibd patients   , and that the eradication of sensitized leukocytes , which was done by leukapheresis or bone marrow transplantation , improved ibd in some cases   .
