this was the first case assessing the intraoperative use of co2 as a substitute for iodine contrast in a patient with known chronic kidney disease and an acute ischemic limb .
a 79-year - old woman presented to the emergency department with acute limb ischemia in her left leg with a 2-hour history .
since it is not nephrotoxic , it was considered reasonable to utilize this contrast in a patient with borderline renal function who would be submitted to the noxious stimuli of the reperfused limb after revascularization . 
  to the best of our knowledge ,
acute embolic limb ischemia is an urgent clinical condition in which sudden decrease or worsening in limb perfusion causes a potential threat to extremity viability and to life .
angiography is traditionally performed with iodinated contrast material , but carbon dioxide ( co2 ) has been studied as an alternative intravascular contrast agent for patients with iodine allergy or renal function impairment .
thorough removal of all occlusive emboli in the arterial tree results in the best outcomes ; hence , some authors favored arteriography after embolectomy for lower limbs .
