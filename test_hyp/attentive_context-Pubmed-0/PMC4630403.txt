a diagrammatic representation of the complex interrelationship between risk and severity of adverse events , pharmacogenetics , comorbidity with other neuropsychiatric disorders , and dose / length of exposure is illustrated in figure 3 . reduced activity or blockade of both of these membrane channels in the brain 's central pacemaker and the substantia
further studies , including functional and structural imaging of deep brain regions in patients suffering from mefloquine toxicity and examination of electrophysiological changes in cells of the substantia with mutation or variation in both katp and connexin channels on exposure to mefloquine , could begin to elucidate the delicate interplay between excitation and inhibition in cases of mefloquine toxicoses .
a hypothesis of dysfunction of the central pacemaker , giving rise to mesolimbic dysregulation , could also provide novel treatment options for patients suffering from adverse reactions to mefloquine exposure in the future .
significant evidence now exists for a primary role for membrane channel blockade in the presentation and severity of adverse neuropsychiatric reactions in patients exposed to mefloquine at normal prophylactic or treatment levels .
toxidrome ,  a collection of significant neurological symptoms affecting balance , vision , hearing , memory , personality , and emotional status , has now been described as a limbic encephalopathy with central vestibulopathy , an overarching diagnosis covering all the possible manifestations of this complex neurotoxicity .
