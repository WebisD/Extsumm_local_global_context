useful correlations are obtained between the wavelength 
 shifts that catalysts cause to the pyrazinone sensor and the rate - determining 
 steps in diels  alder and friedel  crafts reactions . as 
 a result
herein , we assess the general utility of this colorimetric 
 sensor as a predictive gauge for the relative reactivity of a broad 
 range of organocatalysts , including several widely used motifs , with 
 the goal of encompassing many different hydrogen - bonding arrays .
, we described 
 preliminary results showing the utility of small organic chromophore s for the detection of hydrogen - bonding interactions by uv 
consequently , the sensor may also find use as a rapid means 
 for measuring pka values in series of 
 related compounds .
our findings establish 
 the sensor as a useful substrate  surrogate  for probing 
 and gauging catalyst performance .
investigation of additional 
 catalyzed reactions with the sensor , 
 empirically or computationally , has the potential to expand eq 3 to achieve quantitative predictive power across 
 a large range of reaction platforms and catalysts ( hydrogen bonding , 
 brnsted acid , and lewis acid ) .
in contrast to established acidity ( pka ) values , the sensor wavelength shift is a 
 highly predictive metric 
 for the relative reactivity of catalysts encompassing a broad range 
 of structures and strengths .
