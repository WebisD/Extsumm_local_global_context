in 1982 chang and der , two postdoctoral fellows working in geoffrey cooper 's laboratory , discovered kristen rat sarcoma virus and murine sarcoma virus ; retroviral oncogenes related to rodent sarcoma virus genes . the human kras gene is a homolog of these two oncogenes
, der described an abnormal form of the p21 protein expressed by colon and lung carcinoma cell lines and showed that the gene encoding this protein is able to transform nih3t3 cells .
overall , this review summarizes novel approaches allowing the management of cancers with or without kras mutations , and highlights the importance of early identification of somatic mutations in the kras gene in cancer biopsies .
a pivotal function of kras protein in the regulation of the mapk and pi3k / akt pathways is its effect on the proliferation rate of both normal and cancer cells . activating mutations of the kras protein , which frequently occur in cancer cells ,
the evidence from various studies summarized in this review demonstrates that the kras protein is an important signal transducer involved in the regulation of various cellular responses during cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival .
kras elicits changes in the cytoskeleton and consequently affects cell shape , adhesion and migration   . in the following paragraphs , kras protein , gene , oncogenesis , and cancer therapy is reviewed
