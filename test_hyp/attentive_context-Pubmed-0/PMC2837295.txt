the aim of this study was to determine whether a minimum set of criteria could be established to identify suspected hereditary renal cell cancer patients when there is restricted information about the familial occurrence of disease .
a total of 146 clear cell renal carcinoma ( ccrc ) patients comprising 3 groups were enrolled in the study .
so far , the list of genetic changes associated with ccrc is somewhat limited but should be extended in the near future as more knowledge is gained about the genetic factors associated with altered ccrc predisposition . in summary , we advocate the use of our criteria for suspected hereditary clear cell renal cancer identified in this report in order to : a. offer an ultrasound examination option , b. create repositories of nuclear clear cell renal cancer families for future studies on the efficiency of surveillance for individuals with genetic predispositions to renal cancer , c. perform further studies to aid in the identification of genetic factors associated with ccrc .
the results indicate that there is a very strong correlation between hereditary ( familial ) predisposition to ccrc and occurrence of at least one of the following ifs : if1 , if2 or if5 - or 13.4 ; p < 0.00001 .
