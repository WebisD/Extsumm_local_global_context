the aim of this study was to associate four snps in the il8 gene ( rs4073 , rs2227307 , rs2227306 , and rs2227532 ) and their haplotypes to cp and agp and subgingival bacterial colonization in the czech population .
although none of the investigated snps in the il8 gene was individually associated with aggressive or chronic periodontitis , the patients with cp showed lower a(251)/t(+396)/t(+781 ) and t(251)/g(+396)/c(+781 ) haplotype frequencies than the controls .
all variants in the il8 gene were in tight linkage disequilibrium with each other to various degrees ( d = 0.7931.000 in controls , d = 0.8890.951 in patients with cp , and d = 0.8911.000 in patients with agp ) .
moreover , an uncommon att / att haplotype ( 1.15% of the studied population ) was found more , but nonsignificantly , in non - periodontitis controls ( 2.6% versus 0.4% , p = 0.07 ) .
for example , the frequency of the atc haplotype in the czech population was less than 3.4% , compared to 23.7% in the brazilians . in the brazilian population , some haplotypes of il8 845(t / c)/738(t / a)/353(a / t ) variants showed significant association to , or protection against , cp . of the three il8 snps , only one polymorphism was the same as in our study ( i.e. , snp 251 ( rs4073 ) referred to as 353 in brazilian study ) .
