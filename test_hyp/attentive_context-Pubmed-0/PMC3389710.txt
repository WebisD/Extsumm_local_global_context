 the term non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) refers to the spectrum of diseases characterized by fatty infiltration of the liver ranging from steatosis , steatohepatitis , or cirrhosis .
it is very important to understand the complex molecular mechanisms and the mediator involved to develop new therapeutic targets for this disease .
development of obesity or metabolic obesity , defined by isolated increase in visceral fat in people who are not obese , is often seen as the starting point for development of nafld , leading to the cascade of events ending in the formation of hepatic steatosis .
, nafld is increasing in prevalence and could become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the near future in the western world .
once patients with simple steatosis develop nash , up to 50% of them could develop advanced fibrosis .   a  two - hit hypothesis  was then proposed to explain the pathogenesis and progression of nafld , where the first hit causes accumulation of excess triglycerides in the liver leading to simple steatosis and the second hit causes the steatosis to progress to inflammation and fibrosis   .
mitochondrial dysfunction is considered the central pathophysiological process contributing to progression of nalfd to nash , and the quest to identify molecular mechanisms leads to the identification of lysosomal - mitochondrial axis in ffa - induced lipotoxicity and the potential role of lysosomal permeabilization in the progression of nash . in this study
