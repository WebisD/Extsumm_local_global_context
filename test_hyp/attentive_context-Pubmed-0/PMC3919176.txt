it is further demonstrated that the observed 
 behavior results from an interplay of the molecular adsorption and 
 lattice match .
when deposited on various 
 substrate surfaces , rod - like , -conjugated , 
 small organic molecules are well - known for their tendency to form 
 highly anisotropic crystal shapes , which are frequently called fibers 
 or needles . whereas the epitaxial growth has been studied on various substrates , 
 in particular anisotropic surfaces seem favorable to conserve the 
 highly anistropic morphology and optical properties , for example , 
 polarized emission or adsorption provided by a parallel molecular 
 orientation obtained by self - assembly . consequently , 
 cu(110 ) , tio2(110 ) and muscovite mica(001 ) are frequently chosen as a proper fundament to study the epitaxial 
 growth of rod - like small molecules . in this paper , the epitaxial 
 growth of 2,2:6,2-ternaphthalene 
 ( nnn ) on muscovite mica(001 ) is reported . as indicated in figure 1a ,
the molecule is built from three naphthalene 
 units , which are linked together by c 
( c ) a side view along the long molecular axis visualizing 
 the edge - on / flat - on herringbone stacking of nnn .
structural analysis reveals 
 two different crystal orientations . whereas island - like structures 
 are built up by upright standing molecules orientated with a ( 001 ) 
 contact plane relative to the muscovite mica substrate ( see figure 1b ) ,
