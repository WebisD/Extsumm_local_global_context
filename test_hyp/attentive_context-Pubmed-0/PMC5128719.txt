interestingly , both ea and mea could improve spatial learning and memory ability , improving glucose metabolism in different brain regions and amyloid - beta expression in the frontal lobe .
using behavioral tests , in vivo imaging , and protein detection , the differences between mea and ea therapy for ad treatment were assessed in samp8 mice .
what is more , the mea therapy performed better than ea in decreasing amyloid - beta amounts in the frontal lobe .
the senescence - accelerated mouse ( sam ) is an accelerated aging model that was established through phenotypic selection from a common genetic pool of the akr / j mouse strain .
therefore , the effects of mea on the human auditory organ and acupoints were separately assessed .
finally , immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) was used to assess the changes of amyloid-1 - 42 deposition in the frontal lobe after the treatments .
the ad group showed a marked retardation in escape latency compared with the n group ( p = 0.00 ) , probably due to memory deficits resulting from the rapid aging process impairing learning and memory . compared with the ad group ,
amyloid - beta levels were assessed in the frontal lobe of samp8 mice , and the results confirmed the above notion . comparing the different therapies in iod of amyloid - beta in the frontal lobe , mea therapy performed significantly better than ea ( p < 0.05 ) . therefore , mea indeed is inclined to play a role in the frontal lobe .
