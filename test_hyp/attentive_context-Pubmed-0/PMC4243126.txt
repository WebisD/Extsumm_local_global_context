autoantibodies were associated with visceral involvement and also with clinical subset . in univariate analysis ,
in multivariate analysis , both anti - scl-70 ( or 5.2 , ci 1.517.6 , p = 0.08 ) and diffuse disease ( or 4.1 , ci 1.213.5 , p = 0.021 ) were associated with ild .
all of the patients with ph had lssc ( 11 with sclerodactyly and 1 with acrosclerosis ) except for one patient with diffuse disease with anticentromere antibodies . in summary ,
we therefore decided to examine the clinical and serologic characteristics of our patients with limited disease seen over the last decade to see if we could find differences within them according to the degree of skin involvement .
