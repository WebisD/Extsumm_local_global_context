we performed this study to analyze the role of brain perfusion spect in diagnosis and management of moyamoya disease .
we conclude that brain perfusion scintigraphy is an indispensible adjunct in evaluation of patients with moyamoya disease yielding information about the direct end results of the pathology in the vessels and also prognostic information .
ct and mri play a major role in documenting the regions of infarction / hemorrhage .
a retrospective analysis of the records of 17 patients ( 10 male , 7 female ) referred for brain perfusion scintigraphy between may 2005 and dec 2009 was conducted [ table 1 ] .
follow up studies following surgical procedures ( myo - dura synangiosis ) was done in two patients and showed partial resolution of perfusion defects in the involved areas .
tc99m - ecd brain spect showed bilateral perfusion defects in one patient with unilateral mri infarcts while in the rest of the patients the defects were more extensive compared to mri .
headache was the presenting symptom in 7 , seizures in one , loss of vision in one .
diagnosis is established by the typical appearance on cerebral angiography i.e. ;  puff of smoke  and refers to the appearance of multiple compensatorily dilated striate vessels seen on angiography .
