. however , the presence of can , defined by simple , easily derived resting ecg measures , identified a subset of type 2 diabetic patients at higher all - cause and cvd mortality risk independent of multiple traditional cvd risk factors .
however , the increased risk of either all - cause or cvd mortality in individuals with can compared with those without can at baseline was similar in the int versus the std glycemia treatment group .
all - cause mortality remained significantly higher in participants with can after adjustment for treatment arm allocation , cvd history , and all other covariates listed in research design and methods ( 1.55   , p = 0.016 for can1 , 2.14   , p = 0.0009 for can2 , and 2.07   , p = 0.02 for can3 ) .
in unadjusted analyses , there was a significant increase in all - cause mortality ( hr 1.61   , p = 0.007 for can1 , 2.22   , p = 0.0002 for can2 , and 2.72   , p = 0.0004 for can3 ) ( fig .
a2 , available in an online appendix ) and in cvd mortality ( 1.93   , p = 0.005 for can1 , 2.55 [ 1.414.60 , p = 0.002 for can2 , and 3.39   , p = 0.0002 for can3 ) compared with those without can . table 2 shows fully adjusted hrs ( 95% ci ) for all - cause and cvd mortality for participants with can1 , can2 , and can3 compared with participants without can .
