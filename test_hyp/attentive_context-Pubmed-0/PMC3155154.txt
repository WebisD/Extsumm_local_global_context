with the amazing expansion of the number of published studies on exosomes in the last 3 years , it is clear that research on secreted membrane vesicles and their roles as intercellular messengers is now a very exciting field , with new ideas , hypotheses , and questions coming up faster than answers ! the iwe in paris allowed most of the long - term exosome and vesicle aficionados , as well as many of the newcomers , to meet , exchange ideas freely , and to point out current problems with technologies , definitions , and characterization .
the meeting ended with the decision to prolong this very productive workshop by setting up future yearly meetings , virtual spaces to record exchanges and discussions ( such as a website and/or a facebook page ) , and a scientific society dedicated to exosomes and secreted membrane vesicles .
this discovery , and the concomitant development of research on mirnas , sparked the recent exponential increase in the numbers of papers on exosomes . in january 2011 , oral and poster presentations at the iwe 2011 covered all the currently explored fields of exosome research spanning immunology and cell biology , their use as biomarkers , and their relationship to tumors .
