this article reports an unprecedented case of seizure in a previously healthy patient who underwent crs with ip oxaliplatin due to metastatic colon adenocarcinoma . despite this being a rare case ,
, we describe the case of a previously healthy young man who underwent crs with hyperthermic ip oxaliplatin and developed one episode of tonic - clonic seizure on the second postoperative day .
dissemination and implantation of gastrointestinal malignancies throughout the peritoneal cavity result in peritoneal carcinomatosis ( pc ) , which is the second most frequent cause of death in colorectal cancer after metastatic disease to the liver . in 25% of colorectal cancer cases ,
the most common reported complications include enteric fistula , intraabdominal abscess , pneumonia , small - bowel obstruction , pancreatitis , and neutropenia which often prolong the hospital stay . to the best of our knowledge ,
attempts have been made in the past decades to increase long - term survival in patients with pc by combining cytoreductive surgery ( crs ) to remove visible disease and hyperthermic intraperitoneal ( ip ) chemotherapy ( hipec ) to eradicate microscopic viable residual disease , with elevated and persistent drug concentration in the peritoneal cavity .
