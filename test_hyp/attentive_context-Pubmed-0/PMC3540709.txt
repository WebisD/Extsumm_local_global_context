therefore , the preoperative correct diagnosis has been difficult ; however , recent advances in imaging diagnosis through a combination of ultrasonography ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and angiography and specific immunohistochemical analysis of this tumor using human melanoma black-45 antigen ( hmb-45 ) staining have resulted in accurate diagnosis and it is reported that the current accurate preoperative diagnosis was made in 25%52% of cases   .
, we have focused on the characteristic features of this tumor shown in imaging studies and by histological analysis , summarized these cases showing aggressive patterns , and discussed management of the patients and indications for surgical treatment .
we have reviewed noninvasive imaging studies and the role of histological diagnosis showing distinctive characteristics of haml to increase the rate of accurate diagnoses .
we propose that tumor resection is indicated in the following scenarios : ( 1 ) the patients show symptoms ; ( 2 ) the tumor shows an aggressive growth ; ( 3 ) the tumor shows invasive growth into the vessels evidenced by fine - needle biopsy or imaging studies ; ( 4 ) the component of the tumor shows atypical epithelioid pattern , high proliferation activity , and/or p53 immunoreactivity ; and ( 5 ) a definitive diagnosis can not be made by imaging and pathological studies from malignant tumors .
