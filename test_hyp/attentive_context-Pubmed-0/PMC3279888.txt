 biosynthesis de novo : the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway produces purines which represent the building blocks for dna and rna synthesis 
 cistron : a segment dna equivalent to gene for function ( protein or enzymes ) 
 diploid ; an organism with sexual cycle is diploid and has one chromosome set from each of its parents 
 haploid : the haploid means usual number of chromosomes set in somatic cells of common organisms .
organisms that have not sexual cycle are haploid 
 inversion : chromosome break of the two areas separated pieces is back by reversal from chromosome breakage 
 inverted repeats : is a sequence of nucleotides that is the reversed complement of another sequence further downstream 
 poly cistronic : there are some cistrons on one mrna 
 polyploidy : increase in chromosome set number 
 pseudo - genes : are copy of original gene sequence , but lacked the necessary sequences for function . these genes from genetically similar to functional genes , but they have containing multiple mutations 
 snrnp : small nuclear ribonucleoproteins , are rna - protein complexes , they will combined with unmodified pre - mrna and various other proteins to spliceosome formation . 

prokaryotes such as escherichia coli need simple and inexpensive culture media and have a short proliferation time .
