a pubmed database search only found 7 reported cases of brain metastases from primary gist . here ,
being able to elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis and to identify the responsible gene in gists that exhibit no detectable mutations of kit or pdgfr may lead to new insights into the nature of gist and potentially a novel diagnosis and therapy . in summary , we histologically confirmed the brain metastasis of small bowel gist in the current case , which is a rare and particularly unusual manifestation of this tumor .
a 77-year - old woman presented in december 2009 with left hemiplegia and ptosis of her right eyelids . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain revealed a 24 mm tumor in her right cerebral peduncle and a 20 mm tumor in her left occipital lobe , which was associated with brain edema ( fig .
gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gists ) are the most common type of mesenchymal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract .
in addition , metastasis of gist to the central nervous system is also extremely rare .
thus , in the absence of mutations in either kit or pdgfr , as was seen in our case , other factors such as etv1 might be involved in the promotion and metastasis of gist .
