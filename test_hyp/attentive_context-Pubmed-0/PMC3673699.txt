to investigate the immunologic events underlying the evolution of a chronic colitis we analyzed the chronic tnbs- colitis occurring in balb / c mice administered weekly doses of intra - rectal trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) ( 6 , 7 ) .
in addition , blockade of this cytokine interaction can prevent intestinal fibrosis by selectively interfering with the pro - fibrotic program .
as shown in figure 1 , this increase in intestinal fibrosis can be demonstrated by measuring the collagen content of the colon .
overall , these data show quite clearly that neutralization of il-13 signaling via il-13r2 does not alter the course of the inflammation of chronic tnbs - colitis but does block the development of fibrosis ; in addition , they show that such signaling results in fibrosis via its effect on the induction of tgf-1 . in summary , these findings suggest that chronic inflammation is orchestrated by a succession of cytokines that ultimately result in il-13 and tgf-1 production .
thus , four - five weeks after initiation of chronic tnbs - colitis , the mice develop steadily increasing fibrosis of the colonic lamina propria .
coming now to the molecular events during intestinal fibrogenesis , in previous studies we showed that il-13 induces tgf-1 production by signaling through cell - surface il-13r2 , an il-13 receptor formerly thought to function only as a soluble decoy receptor ( 912 ) . since il-13 is produced in the later phase of chronic tnbs - colitis we reasoned that this pathway might be involved in the development of fibrosis occurring during this phase . to explore this possibility we first determined the expression of both il-13r1 and il-13r2 in extracts of colonic lpmc during the course of chronic tnbs colitis .
