in 1996 , deleuze et al .   initially suspected the role of defects in the multidrug resistance 3 p - glycoprotein ( mdr3 ) in a subtype of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( pfic ) .
this refers to a heterogeneous group of familial cholestatic conditions caused by defects in biliary epithelial transporters .
the disease usually occurs first in childhood with progressive cholestasis leading to death from liver failure at ages ranging from infancy to adolescence .
the underlying genetic and molecular abnormalities related to pfic have led to the identification of three subtypes and the description of several mutations in hepatocellular transport system genes involved in bile formation . only pfic 3
this review will focus on imaging features of hepatobiliary anomalies associated with abcb4/mdr3 deficiency in adults , with special attention to mr characteristics .
abcb4/mdr3 alterations are mostly associated with lpac syndrome and icp . in the latter case , patients typically present with pruritus that can lead to complications for both mother and fetus . in the former case ,
intrahepatic lithiasis is considered to be very uncommon in europe and much more frequent in asia . since the description of mdr3 deficiencies , an increasing number of patients are diagnosed with lpac syndrome - related intrahepatic lithiasis .
