a 68-year - old male presented for progressive loss of appetite and lethargy for 3 weeks .
we report a case where eczema preceded the diagnosis of mm by at least 5 years in the hope of adding confirmatory evidence for the association between eczema and myeloma . with the advancements in the therapeutic approaches to myeloma
, the recognition of early myeloma symptoms would lead to prompt diagnosis and treatment before the development of serious organ damage , and prolong life .
multiple myeloma ( mm ) is one of the most common hematological malignancies , the majority of which remain incurable .
the past medical history included hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease with multiple percutaneous coronary interventions ( the most recent one was 3 weeks prior to the admission ) , congestive heart failure with automated implantable cardioverter - defibrillator placement , and psoriasis diagnosed 5 years ago .
therefore , in the absence of an identifiable etiology , recalcitrant eczema in an adult should raise the suspicion of an internal malignancy , including mm .
the common presenting symptoms of mm , such as bone pain , asthenia , fatigue , weight loss , and dyspnea , are nonspecific , which may contribute to the significant delay in the diagnosis in almost half of mm cases after the onset of the first symptom ; furthermore , 20% of patients have no or mild symptoms at the time of diagnosis
