while both adaptive and nk immune responses against hcmv were stronger in hiv infection , we found no significant correlation between the strength of nk and adaptive immune responses against hcmv .
are often amplified in hiv infection , we included a large group of hiv - infected individuals in order to encompass a range of response strengths as broad as possible   .
we determined the frequency of cd57nkg2c nk , measured relative antibody levels against cmv - infected cell lysate , and characterized cd8 t cell responses against immunodominant cmv proteins in over 200 individuals .
similar to adaptive immune responses , the innate immune response against hcmv , as indicated by expansion of nkg2ccd57 nk , was exaggerated in hiv infection , reaching levels > 70% of all circulating nk .
antibody levels were significantly higher in the hiv coinfected group than in the cmv - infected control group ( median with iqr = 1.02 , 0.791.33 versus 0.65 , 0.26 to 1.04 , p < 0.0001 , figure 2 ) .
these data indicate that humoral immunity against cmv develops independently of nk responses against cmv and that factors other than aging have a dominant influence on the size of the response . to assess whether nk responses related to development or evolution of cd8 t cell responses against cmv , we next measured the frequency of cd8 t cells producing interferon - gamma ( ifn- ) in response to overlapping peptides from cmv ie-1 and pp65 proteins .
