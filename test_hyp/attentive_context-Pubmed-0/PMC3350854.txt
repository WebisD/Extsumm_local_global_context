brain plasticity , the developing brain 's ability to change in response to either positive experiences or negative experiences , is a critical component of pediatric neurology .
although there are many disorders associated with impaired plasticity , this paper will highlight the clinical features , neurobiology associated with dysregulation of mtor , preclinical studies , and clinical trials in tuberous sclerosis complex ( tsc ) , neurofibromatosis-1 ( nf1 ) , and fragile x syndrome ( fxs ) , as well as phosphatase and tensin homolog hamartoma syndromes ( pths ) , neurogenetic disorders linked by abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and mtor ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) signaling .
the major types of plasticity in the developing brain include adaptive plasticity  occurs in response to learning or recovering from injury or disability ; impaired plasticity  results from brain injury due to an acquired or neurogenetic disorder ; maladaptive plasticity  a plastic response leading to a new disorder ; plasticity as the brain 's achilles ' heel  a mechanism , such as selective vulnerability of neurons , which creates risk for injury .
review of recent literature reveals significant advances in our ability to understand the pathogenesis of several neurogenetic conditions associated with intellectual disability and autism that have been considered to be idiopathic and untreatable . in this paper
