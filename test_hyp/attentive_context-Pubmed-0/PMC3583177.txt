damage to genetic constituents and perturbations in the maintenance of these epigenetic changes have been demonstrated to affect fertilization potential and the early development of the embryo ( 7 ) .
this chapter will focus on the possible genetic and epigenetic contributions of sperm to the development of the human embryo .
the paternal contribution to an embryo plays an important role in understanding early developmental processes and their effect on the health of a child .
studies investigating the epigenetic modifications in the developing sperm cell have provided new insights that may establish a more critical role for the sperm epigenome in the developing embryo .
the sperm transmits not only nuclear dna but also oocyte activation factor ( oaf ) ( critical for fertilization ) , centrosomes ( critical for cell division ) ( 5 ) , and a population of messenger rna ( mrna ) that are of critical developmental importance ( 1,6 ) .
the fertilization of oocytes by such sperm , either spontaneously or through assisted reproductive techniques , may help us to understand the pathogenesis of congenital malformations , childhood cancers and perinatal morbidity .
these non - genetic modifications include dna methylation , histone tail modifications , targeted histone retention and protamine incorporation into the chromatin , all of which have a significant influence on the developing sperm cell .
