the complement system is of particular importance , as it harbours multiple effects against infectious diseases , bridges the elements of the human defence network by a multitude of factors , and helps to preserve the homeostasis of the body .
despite new antifungal drugs and improved medical treatment , invasive aspergillosis remains a dangerous threat for immunocompromised patients , as the innate immune defence is the most crucial weapon against this infection .
the most outstanding roles are the direct and indirect defence against infections , the stimulation and regulation of b- and t - cell response , and the disposal of debris   .
the presence of fungal pathogens is detected by different pattern recognition molecules ; three pathways guarantee the activation of the complement cascade by resting , swollen , and germinating conidia as well as by hyphae of aspergillus .
regulatory factors control and modulate its activity , and cellular receptors mediate the interaction between complement factors and immune cells . representing a potent component of the innate host defence and an interface to adaptive immunity
the multifaceted interactions between complement and aspergillus represent promising approaches for future therapeutic strategies that may help to improve the outcome of invasive aspergillosis .
