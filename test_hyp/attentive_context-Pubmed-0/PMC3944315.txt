the purpose of this study was to examine 
 the effects of a relaxation chair and resting with simple range of motion ( rom ) exercises 
 during computer work , and low back muscle strengthening exercises after computer work on 
 pain and the flexion - relaxation ( fr ) ratio of one computer worker with lbp .
the subject of this study was a 37-year - old male who complained of severe lbp pain at the 
 l4 level .
the exercises consisted of a bridging 
 exercise in the supine position ( three sets of ten repetitions ) and hip extension exercises 
 in the quadruped position with knee extension ( left and right leg , five sets each of ten 
 repetitions ) .
according to recent findings , the form of resting and the 
 work configuration are important to muscle activation and recovery of the circulation4 , 5 . 

the fr ratios before and after work were 22% and 29% ( + 7% ) , 
 respectively , and the vas scores were 5 and 6 ( + 1 ) .
it also 
 suggests that poor resting is a risk factor for a change in the muscle pattern .
, he worked on a 
 computer for 5  h each day for 3 days and followed a different program each day . the first 
 day ( session 1 )
