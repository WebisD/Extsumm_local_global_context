moreover , polymerase acid ( pa ) , nucleoprotein ( np ) , m , and ns genes of h5n9 strain , an uncommon antigenic combination which we isolate for the first time in asia , were further looked into in the present study .
it is also concluded that although bearing the same antigenic subtype ( h1n1 ) and obtained during 2007 - 2008 , our isolates were unrelated to 2009 pandemic and seasonal flu strains .
, we focused on genetic analysis of h1n1 , h1n2 , and h1n3 strains of aivs that we isolated from apparently healthy migratory pintails wintering in japan   . also , we analyzed the ns genes of h5 and h7 subtypes , in addition to the above - mentioned aivs .
the majority of the viruses of the present study were branched with allele a viruses represented with / by a / mallard / sweden/2724/06 h5n1 and a / duck / hong kong / y439/97 h9n2 ( hong kong / y439/97 h9n2 ) .
the np gene of the majority of the strains sequenced in this study ( 5/8 ) was related to that of the porcine strain korea / c12/08 h5n2 .
