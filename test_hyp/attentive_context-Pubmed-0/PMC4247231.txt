anterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by us at the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy . the commonly used screening tests for difficult intubation have only poor - to - moderate predictive power when used alone .
with the rapid expansion of portable us in anesthesia for guiding the placement of central venous catheters and the performance of regional block   , some preliminary results exploring the feasibility of portable us in airway evaluation and management have been reported , even though the air attenuates us transmission and thereby creates artifacts   . in the present study , we compared the role of the us measurements and traditional screening tests , including iig , tmd , and mms , in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population .
the correlation coefficients along with 95% confidence interval ( ci ) between dsem and dshb , dsem and dsac , dshb and dsac , mms and dshb , mms and dsem , mms and dsac , and between tmd and iig were 0.74 ( 0.670.80 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.60 ( 0.500.68 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.69 ( 0.610.75 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.32 ( 0.190.44 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.27 ( 0.140.40 , p=0.0001 ) , 0.32 ( 0.190.44 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.18 ( 0.05 to 0.31 , p=0.0089 ) , respectively ( figure 3a3 g ) .
