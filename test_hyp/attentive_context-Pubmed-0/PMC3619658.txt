this review will outline the evidence for the use of different treatment options for patients with intractable seizures . whilst the focus will be on the pharmacological options , we will also review the extent and quality of evidence supporting the efficacy of surgical , metabolic , neurostimulatory and herbal interventions in the context of the associated side - effects , safety and patient preferences .
this is of particular importance in children with refractory epilepsy , a large proportion of whom present specific age - dependent epilepsy syndromes .
confirmation that the events are epileptogenic in origin and early identification of an underlying etiology or specific epilepsy syndrome is essential to guide appropriate treatment for which syndrome or etiology specific efficacy exists .
accurate identification of the epilepsy syndrome is the foundation for the choice of an appropriate treatment and increases the likelihood of seizure remission.18 in some instances , identifying etiologies can radically alter the potential treatment options , for example metabolic treatments such as the ketogenic diet for epilepsies resulting from iem.19 surgery may be the most appropriate treatment option in some cases , especially where strong evidence exists for its efficacy , such as for the anterior temporal lobectomy in drug - resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.20 however , the most appropriate timing for surgery remains debated .
