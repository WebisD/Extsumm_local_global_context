the development of the spinal cord plays a central role towards execution coordinated movements and of sensory inputs as well .
together with sensory inputs from the eye and ear in human they produce a movement output as a consequence of reflexes or higher brain cognitive functions .
if we therefore take a closer look at the time cell differentiation and establishment of those motor circuits , this may help to restore the original function in disease .
these circuits are mainly disturbed in motoneuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , spinal muscular atrophy ( sma ) or in cases of lesions caused by accidents .
the restauration of such disturbed motor output functions is the main goal for physicians and scientists all over the world .
the cns epithelial cells of the neural tube are pseudo stratified cells and perform symmetric cell divisions to increase the number of neural precursor cells ( npcs ) .
the spinal cord as a central nervous system ( cns ) structure builds up connections to the periphery of the body .
for example usually more than 50% of all motoneurons are already dysfunctional for a longer period before a patient comes to the clinic due to compensatory effects of the remaining functional cells in the spinal cord .
