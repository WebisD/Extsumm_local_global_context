platform switching is not the only way to control circumferential bone loss around dental implants , but it is one of the ways to get a better results . diagnosing and treatment planning are very critical when the timing of the implant placement is concerned .
when we integrate everything we can get a very good esthetic outcome as presented , thus increasing the quality of life of patients .
the esthetic advantage is ascribed for two reasons : first one being the increased surface area to which the soft tissue could attach and the decrease in crestal resorption needed to establish a biologic width ; second one being the increased distance between the implant abutment junction and the adjacent bone , which in turn limits the resorptive effect of the implant - abutment junction associated inflammatory cell infiltrate .
this evolution has reflected the change in the thinking pattern of individuals coming to dental clinics for treatment now - a - days .
success of implant restoration depends on the change in the peri - implant bone level and the surrounding soft tissue ; and for the patient it is the esthetics and his / her level of satisfaction .
