the authors analyze the most relevant epidemiological issues concerning retinoblastoma , in the light of recent developments highlighting the role of aneuploidy and genetic instability   in the pathogenesis of this eye cancer .
retinoblastoma ( rb ) is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in childhood , with an incidence of 1 in 15000 live births .
the most important studies to investigate the pathogenesis of retinoblastoma began with a paper published by knudson in 1971 , when the author , after investigating the age distribution and laterality of a cohort of 48  rb patients , concluded that the disease could be inherited and formulated the so - called  two - hit theory  in order to explain its pathogenesis . in reality , no clues about the inheritance of retinoblastoma could be deducted from such a small sample .
although   extensive epidemiologic studies have been done to study   this tumor , the results have been more often misinterpreted at   the expense of mutation theory which has prevailed until recently in spite of the outstanding evidence against it . in the present review
in fact , in his first report on this matter , knudson referred to earlier , smaller series showing that , in retinoblastoma survivors with bilateral disease , the proportion of affected offspring closely approximated   50% , as in dominant ( mendelian ) inheritance . from an original , mathematical analysis of the above data , knudson inferred that retinoblastoma is caused by two sequential ( two hit ) mutational events . according to this hypothesis , in the dominantly inherited form of the disease ,
