this paper will address the most common secondary causes of resistant hypertension ( drug - induced , obstructive sleep apnea , primary aldosteronism , and chronic kidney disease ) , which are frequently encountered in hypertensive patients and are , therefore , the most interesting from the clinical point of view .
therefore , practicing physicians need to implement evidence - based medicine . the effective management of patients with resistant hypertension requires an appropriate combination of physiology and pharmacology , taking into account the unique characteristics of each case in order to tailor the therapeutic approach to the individual patient .
in addition , this paper will attempt to provide a rational for the workup and treatment of patients with resistant hypertension .
the management of patients with resistant hypertension requires a gratifying combination of clinical acumen and common sense .
an extensive workup of all patients with uncontrolled hypertension is scientifically unsound , is very costly and requires immense human and technical resources .
several terms have been used to define this condition :  refractory hypertension  ,  difficult - to - treat hypertension  ,  difficult - to - control hypertension  ; however , the term  resistant hypertension  seems to prevail .
