we herein present a rare case of extradural dumbbell lumbar ( l3 ) cavernous hemangioma with paraspinal extension .
cavernous hemangioma is a benign vascular malformation and belongs to a wide and continuous overlapping spectrum of hamartomas .
though purely extradural cavernomas are rare in occurrence , they should be considered as possible differential diagnosis of dumbbell lesions of spine in view of operative nuances ( especially massive haemorrhage ) and management thereof .
purely extradural cavernous hemangiomas without any vertebral body involvement is extremely rare and accounts for only 4% of all extradural spinal tumors and 12% of haemangiomas occurring extradurally .
a 52-year - old female presented with insidious onset progressive low backache with pain radiating to whole of left lower limb associated with paraesthesias for two months .
complete and in toto excision of the lesion should be attempted for clinical improvement ; however , in case of subtotal excision , adjuvant radiotherapy is advised .
cavernous hemangioma is a benign vascular malformation , also known as cavernous malformation , cavernous angioma or cavernoma .
most cavernous haemangiomas occur in the vertebral body and may extend into the epidural space .
purely extradural spinal cavernous hemangiomas are rare and the extension through intervertebral foramen into extraspinal region ( dumbbell ) is still rarer . in that case , it can be confused with commonly diagnosed nerve sheath tumors .
