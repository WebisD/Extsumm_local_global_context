we , therefore , investigated the associations between 3 markers of kidney function ( ie , 2microglobulin , cystatin c , and creatinine ) with future risk of the development of pad in 2 large and wellcharacterized cohorts of men and women .
moreover , 2microglobulin was also associated with pad risk in individuals with egfrs above the clinical cutoff for chronic kidney disease ( egfrckdepi 60 ml min per 1.73 m ) , extending the possible range over which kidney function is related to risk .
in exploratory analyses when models were mutually adjusted for both 2microglobulin and cystatin c , the rrs per each 1sd increment were 1.44 ( 95% ci 0.94 to 2.22 ) for 2microglobulin and 0.73 ( 0.48 to 1.12 ) for cystatin c in women and 1.31 ( 95% ci , 0.84 to 2.03 ) for 2microglobulin and 1.26 ( 0.77 to 2.06 ) for cystatin c in men . in further analyses , we found no interactions of 2microglobulin or cystatin c with creatinine , conventional cardiovascular risk factors , or duration of followup in women and men ( table 6 ) .
the corresponding multivariableadjusted rr for each 1sd increment in crp was 1.48 ( 95% ci 1.14 to 1.94 ) in women and 1.39 ( 95% ci 1.08 to 1.79 ) in men .
