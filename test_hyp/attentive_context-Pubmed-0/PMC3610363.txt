( ontological question ) which are the main patterns involving ethical value and ethical manner emerging from this study , given the underlying structural entities and dynamical ethical values and manners ?
the clusters with underlying nodes could be used as a framework for the continued development of instruments to identify caregiver attitudes to ethical values and ethical approach . in summary
the structure of the cluster with the underlying entities , that the study generated , seems to be an interesting development of the isaec instrument .
the study has opened up new opportunities to prevent services from becoming increasingly impersonal and stereotypical , and instead becoming care - based concerning ethos with ethical manners .
( societal impact ) how will this elicited knowledge in the end affect daily care of older people and as viewed from an ethical perspective ?
this paper focuses on the following questions : 
 ( ontological question ) which are the main patterns involving ethical value and ethical manner emerging from this study , given the underlying structural entities and dynamical ethical values and manners?(complementary epistemological question ) which are the various types of conditional changes of ethical values and their related ethical manners that appear when fixing nodes to particular values and thereby clusters to specific characters?(societal impact ) how will this elicited knowledge in the end affect daily care of older people and as viewed from an ethical perspective ?
