, we reported a case of a charcoal granuloma that was suspected to be a recurrent tumor on ultrasonography ( us ) and f - fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg)-positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) , but was correctly identified after us - guided core biopsy .
charcoal was originally used for localizing a non - palpable tumor mass ( 1 ) , however , it is being increasingly used for localizing suspicious metastatic cervical lymph nodes or recurrent tumors in the thyroid bed after surgery ( 2).although , charcoal is known to be safe and stable when injected subcutaneously for preoperative tumor localization , it may cause foreign body reactions and granuloma , if it remains in situ for more than 6 months ( 1 ) . until recently ,

a 47-year - old woman was referred to our department for us - guided biopsy due to a persistent hypermetabolic nodule in the right level iv nodal station .
she had undergone breast - conserving surgery and excision of a metastatic lymph node ( fig .
