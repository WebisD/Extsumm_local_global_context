, we used a noninvasive electrophysiological technique to evaluate neurotoxicity in cl-20-treated worms , and then measured how such exposures altered levels of whole - body machr in the same animals .
our ultimate long - term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reversible neurotoxicity of sublethal cl-20 concentrations in earthworms ( gong et al .
2003 ) and ion channels in the nerve membrane ( ray and fry 2006 ) should be examined to further define the precise mechanisms underlying cl-20 neurotoxicity .
it should be noted that there were no technical or experimental changes in the study over this time period , and this decrease may be due to the cessation of foraging activity and gut digestive movement as food supply was cut off on day 0 ( you et al .
2007 ) , neurobiochemical and electrophysiological measurements ) from our work strongly suggest that cl-20 has neurotoxic properties .
this may be partly attributed to neurological plasticity and inter - worm differences in their adaptive neurological response following relatively short - term exposure to a toxicant like cl-20 ( bargmann 2006 ) .
cl-20 exposure reduced both conduction velocity and whole - body machr levels in a concentration- and duration - dependent manner ( fig .  1 ) .
