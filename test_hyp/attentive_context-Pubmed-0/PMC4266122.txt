this study was conducted to investigate the rostellar hook morphometry and the influence of mitochondrial gene variations on the hook length in sheep isolates of t. multiceps . 

morphometric analyses in the present study showed an association between the rostellar hook length and sequence variability in the mitochondrial 12s rrna .
the results indicated that respectively 57.0% and 22.6% of variation in large and small hook lengths are attributable to different individuals in t. multiceps isolates .
the dendrogram contained two main clades one of which comprised 97.1% of the isolates.subclades a , b and c contained the majority of the isolates i.e.44 isolates ( 43.1% ) in the subclade a , 25 isolates ( 24.5% ) in the subclade b and 18 isolates ( 17.6% ) in the subclade c.no associations were found between hook length and co1 gene variability , however 12s rrna variability was significantly associated with theboth large and small hook length ( table 1 ) .
the average total length of thelarge and small hooks was 158.9 m ( range : 110 - 195 ) and 112.1 m ( range : 63 - 132 ) , respectively .
inspection of 4500 sheep brains revealed that 114 ( 2.5% ) heads were infected by t. multiceps metacestodes .
