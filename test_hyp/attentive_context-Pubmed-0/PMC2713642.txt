stimulation with flicker light induced a vasodilatation of 7.0  2.3% in retinal arteries ( anova , time effect , p < 0.001 ) ( fig . 1 ) and a dilatation of 6.8  3.4% ( p < 0.001 ) in retinal veins . in patients with type 1 diabetes , retinal arterial diameters increased by 2.9  2.8% ( p < 0.001 ) and retinal veins by 4.6  2.0% ( p < 0.001 ) .
1 ) . in both patients with type 1 diabetes and patients with systemic hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia , fmd was significantly attenuated to 2.6  1.7% in group 1 ( anova ; time effect : p < 0.001 ; effect between groups : p = 0.045 ) and to 2.4  2.4% in group 2 ( time effect : p < 0.001 ; effect between groups : p = 0.045 ) . again
the system is , however , a candidate for assessing endothelial function in clinical routine because it induces minimum discomfort to the subject , provides good reproducibility and sensitivity , and does not include a subjective component .
given that impaired endothelial function has been observed to be an early feature in several systemic and ocular vascular - related diseases , much attention has been paid to the development of methods to noninvasively assess endothelial function in humans . as one of the most widely used techniques , the ultrasound - based fmd has been shown to give a reliable estimate of endothelium - dependent vasodilatation ( 10 ) .
