improving joint function and patient activity is a central public health concern to improve quality and length of life .
osteoarthritis ( oa ) is a chronic synovial joint disease , characterized by two main features : ( 1 ) progressive damage of articular cartilage , bone remodeling , and new bone formation ( osteophytes and subchondral bone sclerosis ) and ( 2 ) synovial inflammation and fibrosis of ligaments , tendons , menisci , and capsules .
the aim is not only to treat pain but also to prevent the onset of disease .
asus may prove to be an effective treatment option for symptomatic oa , as they have been shown to possess chondroprotective , anabolic , and anticatabolic properties , as well as anti - inflammatory properties . at the clinical level , asus reduce pain and stiffness while improving joint function .
there is no cure for oa , and even symptomatic treatment options are scarce , dominated by pain management and surgical intervention .
importantly , asus are a natural , slow - acting agent that do not merely address acute pain but actively prevent progression of oa symptoms .
for instance , the aaos and ags guidelines reflect the perspective of specialists in orthopedic surgery , geriatrics , and pain management , whereas the eular and oarsi guidelines primarily emphasize the findings of experts in rheumatology .
