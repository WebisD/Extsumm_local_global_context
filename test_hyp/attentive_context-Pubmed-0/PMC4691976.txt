spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( sohss ) is now a recognized entity , defined as ohss appearing in patients with no history of stimulatory infertility treatment .
type ii is secondary to high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) , while type iii coexists with hypothyroidism .
ohss , which otherwise may occur in normal pregnancies ( type i ohss ) , is now reported to be associated with mutated fsh receptor ( fshr ) gene , which may lead to recurrent sohss in patients presenting the mutations .
a 29-year - old female married since 1 year , primigravida with 3 months amenorrhea and ultrasonographic gestational age of 8 weeks and 5 days , presented with acute onset of abdominal distension , vulval edema and breathlessness .
genetic analysis should be considered in all patients with sohss to improve our understanding of this entity , paving way for an earlier recognition and improved management of this condition .
the general gynecologist / obstetrician should have a high index of suspicion for sohss , as this entity can have several implications .
6 weeks postpartum show complete resolution of bilateral cystic lesions with a single follicular cyst in the left ovary and multiple small follicles in the right ovary to investigate further , if ovarian hyperstimulation observed in this patient was due to any mutation in fshr gene , the patient was called back after delivery . the entire exonic region of fshr gene was screened for known / novel mutations as described earlier . to our interest
