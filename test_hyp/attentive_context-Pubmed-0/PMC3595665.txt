it would be of great interest to conduct detailed investigation of the mechanisms underlying cc development , especially in view of their relevance in the pathogenesis of human disorders .
  by integrating information between the right / left hemispheres , interhemispheric connections enable us to accomplish higher brain functions .
development of interhemispheric connections such as the cc is guided by molecules in the axonal environment , under the regulation of a number of different control mechanisms .
, interactions with postsynaptic neurons play important roles , in an activity - dependent manner , in ensuring proper projections   .   in this paper , we first focus on how the callosal axons are guided by the cues that they encounter , namely , the ( 1 ) midline structures and ( 2 ) neighboring axons , from the time that they start to grow until they reach their targets in the contralateral cortex . then , we describe the activity - dependent development of the interhemispheric connections .
the corpus callosum ( cc ) is the most prominent commissural connection , composed of callosal axons , in the brain . in humans ,
in the mouse brain , these glial structures have been shown to already exist on embryonic day ( e ) 15.0 and can guide the growth of callosal axons   .
