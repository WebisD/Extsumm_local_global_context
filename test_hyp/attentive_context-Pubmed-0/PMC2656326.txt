current literature evaluating the use of er in psychiatric patients with bipolar disorder suggests the er formulation has advantages over the dr formulation . in contrast to dr ,
contrary to this is that failure to address a depressive episode of bipolar disorder presents a dramatic increase in suicide risk . additional things to consider when treating a patient with bipolar disorder are the high rates of concurrent substance abuse and anxiety disorders ( bowden et al 2002 ; mcelroy 2004 ) .
identification of which type of bipolar disorder is present is complicated by the fact that both bipolar i and bipolar ii patients spend more time symptomatic in the depressed phase than the manic or hypomanic states ( judd et al 2002 ) .
this is significant when considering the potential risk of switching a bipolar patient from a depressed state to manic state with antidepressant therapy .
however , given that the molecule is the same ( divalproex ) and that the primary differences are rate of release and a reduced peak concentration , the er formulation should be considered a safe alternative to dr , particularly when there is a history or concern of dose related ( peak concentration ) adverse events or when once a day dosing is preferred in an effort to enhance compliance .
