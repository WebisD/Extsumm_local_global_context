each reference myoglobin is subjected to proteolysis and the resultant peptides analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - esi - ms / ms ) to discover which of the candidate precursor ions and transitions are most useful , and to determine the matching peptide retention times .
these features translate into short experimental times , anticipated to be approximately two hr using refined protocols , making the technique useful as a rapid surveillance tool in the realm of food fraud detection .
a good target protein needs to have corresponding forms in species of interest , sufficient species - dependent sequence variation , species specificity , and exist in accessible quantities within the organisms . for assessing mixtures that have undergone processing ( for example ,
the outcome of this stage is a revised list of target peptides with their transitions , suitable for species determination , and a list of cpcp pairs , suitable for relative quantitation . to test real meats , sample extractions are prepared then subjected to proteolysis to generate peptides both from myoglobin and other extraneous proteins .
the species present in a mixture are identified by the transition peaks associated with marker peptides .
