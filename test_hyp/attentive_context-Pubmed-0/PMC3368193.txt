, we sought to identify the spectrum of diseases associated with elevated serum igg4 levels in patients encountered in clinical practice and the frequency of igg4-rd in this population .
indications for igg subclass testing were evaluation for possible igg4-rd in 104 patients ( 65.8% ) and to assess for immunodeficiency ( e.g. , patients with recurrent or chronic infections ) in 54 patients ( 34.2% ) .
furthermore , mean serum igg4 level was higher for those with definite igg4-rd ( 940  990 ) compared to possible igg4-rd ( 329  318 ) which , in turn , was higher compared to non - igg4-rd subgroup ( 226  127 ) ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ) .
the mean age of those with igg4-rd was older compared to those without igg4-rd ( 58.3  16.9 versus 49.9  20.8 , p < 0.05 ) but the gender distribution was not different ( p = 0.29 ) .
we identified 3,300 consecutive patients who had their serum igg subclass testing performed on one or more occasions during the 2-year interval from january 1 , 2009 to december 31 , 2010 ; 158 patients ( 4.8% ) had at least one high serum igg4 level ( > 140  mg / dl ) .
