the opcab group included 84 patients ( 64 men and 20 women ) at the mean age of 64  7 years and the cpb group included 68 patients ( 54 men and 14 women ) at the mean age of 63  6 years .
there was a statistically significant difference in the mean packed red blood cells ( 2.31  0.18 vs. 3.94  0.30 , p < 0.05 ) and fresh frozen plasma ( 1.13  0.13 vs. 1.57  0.15 , p < 0.05 ) transfusion rate between the groups .
there was a difference in the mean serum hemoglobin concentration between the groups ( opcab 7.79  0.91 mmol / l vs. cpb 7.03  0.88 mmol / l six hours after surgery , p < 0.05 and opcab 7.47  1.10 mmol / l vs. cpb 7.17  0.99 mmol / l one day after surgery ) . figure 1 presents the differences in the serum hemoglobin concentration between the groups after surgery .
two reoperations ( 2.4% ) in the opcab group and three ( 4.4% ) in the cpb group were performed due to excessive bleeding ( p < 0.05 ) .
the platelet count was comparable before the procedure ( 199  61 10/l vs. 178  41 10/l in the opcab and cpb group , respectively ) .
