the aim of this study was to establish associations between polymorphisms in the tnf receptor genes and membrane - bound type i and type ii tnf receptor expression levels on various mononuclear cell populations and to determine the levels of stnfrs in the serum of healthy individuals .
associations of snps located within the promoter regions of tnf type i and type ii receptor genes were established in the context of expression levels of membrane - bound receptors present on subpopulations of mononuclear cells and with the serum levels of soluble type i tnf receptors . these observations suggested that tnf receptor gene alleles represent one of the factors that affects variability in the expression of membrane - bound receptors that may explain differences in the effects mediated by tnf on different cell populations / subpopulations .
association of snps 1207g / c , 1709a / t , and 3609c / t of tnfr genes promoters with expression levels of membrane - bound tnf receptors types i and ii in the absence of association with level of soluble tnf receptors is established what testifies to existence of different mechanisms of regulation of soluble and membrane - bound receptors expression .
