fine - needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) of the breast is wellknown as a safe , effective , economical , and accurate technique for diagnosing palpable breast lesion   .
despite the fact that cnb has been progressively replaced by fnac in the investigation of nonpalpable lesions or microcalcifications without a clinical or radiological mass lesion , fnac has yet a role in palpable lesions in the triple diagnosis association and performed by experienced cytologists . in these conditions , fnac is a safe , effective , economical , and accurate technique for breast cancer evaluation .  
this last decade , fnac technique is improved by the development of new cytological methods allowing standardization of fixation and assuring constant results with ancillary tests such as immunocytochemistry and in situ molecular biology .
also , one of the advantages of fnac is the management of small tissue fragments permitting a repetitive evaluation of the chronological evolution in expression of tumoral biomarkers .
neoadjuvant chemotherapy actually takes an important place in treatment of operable breast cancer in the hope of improving conservative surgery rate of female patients .
recently , cytological methods using lbc technology , associated or not with the cellblock cytological technique , improve immunocytological and molecular tests with the same efficiency as classical histology .
