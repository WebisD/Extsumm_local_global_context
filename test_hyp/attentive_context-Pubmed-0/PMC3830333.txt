mauriac syndrome is a rare syndrome associated with type 1 diabetes ( t1 dm ) in children .
recently , there has been re - emergence of this syndrome , especially with the use of premix insulin .
mauriac syndrome is a rare manifestation of poorly treated t1 dm . with aggressive glycemic control ,
a 15-year - old type 1 diabetic boy was referred to us for evaluation of short stature .
the incidence of this syndrome has reduced rapidly and in the current era this is a very rare syndrome .
he was diagnosed to have t1 dm , following an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis ( dka ) 8 years back , and was started on premix ( 30/70 ) insulin .
the incidence of this syndrome had decreased significantly with introduction of long - acting insulin and better control of blood sugar .
mauriac in 1930 , described growth failure and maturational delay with hepatomegaly and abdominal distension in children with t1 dm , who were treated with short - acting insulin .
hepatomegaly was commonly observed in children in the earlier periods of diabetic treatment , when only short - acting insulin was available and aglycosuria was the objective of treatment .
