therefore , the present study was conducted on a large registry of 6,084 patients from 18 different clinics to better characterize dtm index of vascular reactivity ( vri ) in relation to patients ' phenotypes .
the present study using the largest database of finger - based assessment of endothelial function shows that digital thermal monitoring of vascular reactivity provides meaningful and reproducible physiological variables .
the percentage of good vri was higher in women than in men ( 21% versus 13% ; p < 0.0001 ) . in contrast , men were slightly less likely to have poor vri than women ( 12% versus 14% ; p = 0.03 ) .
it also suggests independent roles for vri as new indices of vascular reactivity and endothelial function .
our analyses showed that vri values derived from dtm followed a near - normal distribution and the reasonable distribution conformed to previously established cutoff values for categorizing vri scores as indicative of poor ( 0.0 to < 1.0 ) , intermediate ( 1.0 to < 2.0 ) , or good ( 2.0 ) vascular reactivity .
together , these data clearly point to the clinical utility of endothelial function in primary and secondary prevention
