ultrasound ( eus)-guided celiac plexus neurolysis ( cpn ) has been reported to be effective in inducing pain relief . however ,
a 75-year - old man suffering from opioid refractory pain ( recorded as 9 according to visual analog scale ( vas ) ) due to an advanced stage iv histologically - proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastases and celiac trunk infiltration not suitable for surgery , was referred to our center .
the present case demonstrates that the combined approach ( eus - guided ethanol ablation and cpn ) may be a valuable option aimed at improving both prognosis and pain control in patients with pancreatic cancer .
tumor response assessed by means of computed tomography ( ct ) 48 h after the procedure complete pain relief , namely vas 0 , was achieved 3 days after the endoscopic ablation .
randomized - controlled trials comparing eus - cpn alone to cpn associated to tumor ablation are needed to confirm this result .
the results were optimal in terms of pain relief and immediate tumor response ( assessed by means of ct and tumor marker levels ) .
tumoral nodule in the body of the pancreas celiac plexus neurolysis performed via the central approach ethanol ablation of the pancreatic tumor no major complications were recorded during the procedure . in the days following the procedure , mild ( grade 2 ) diarrhea and fever were the only minor complications experienced by the patient .
