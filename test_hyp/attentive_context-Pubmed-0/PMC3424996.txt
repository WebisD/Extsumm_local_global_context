the crude relative mortality risk as a result of diabetes was significantly time dependent ( p = 0.002 ) : in the first month after stroke , diabetic individuals had better survival , but thereafter , mortality risk in diabetic men increased , resulting in a higher survival in nondiabetic men .
overall , 1.828 individuals died within the study period of up to 5 years , including 470 and 698 men as well as 264 and 396 women with and without diabetes , respectively .
nevertheless , the relative risk of mortality in the fully adjusted model was significantly increased for diabetic women between 6 months and 1 year as well as between 2 and 3 years , with an almost twofold increased risk of diabetic women for the first time interval .
adjusted for age , it yields a significant decreased mortality risk in diabetes within the first month and an increased mortality risk in diabetes between 1 month and 3 years of follow - up , which was no longer the case after 3 to 5 years ( model 1 , table 3 ) . after further adjustment for comorbidities , level of care dependency , number of prescribed medications , and subtype of stroke , relative risks decreased somewhat but remained significantly increased between 1 and 3 years ( model 2 , table 3 ) .
