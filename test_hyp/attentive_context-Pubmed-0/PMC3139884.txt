the ability of the hhas to detect seb and ricin in four different water matrices , representative of waters used by different branches of the armed forces , was evaluated .
the four different water matrices were formulated tap water , formulated tap water with 1  mg / l free available chlorine ( fac ) , water treated by reverse osmosis ( ro ) with 1  mg / l fac , and ro water with 2  mg / l total residual bromine . suggested health effect levels as used by the us military for ricin and seb are 455  ng / ml and 4.55  ng / ml , respectively .
due to the increased detection limits observed in chlorinated and brominated water , cd spectroscopy , which assesses the three - dimensional fold of a protein , was performed on samples of untreated seb and seb exposed to chlorine in an effort to evaluate the basis for increased lods ( figure 1 ) . for each sample
further tests allowing for prolonged incubation of ricin in chlorinated water prior to detection could address this issue .
the curve - fitting calculation for chlorine - treated seb resulted in 25.9% helix , 0.0% sheet , 0.0% turn , and 74.1 random coil ( rmsd < 0.1% ) .   sds - page was also performed to ascertain the overall effect of chemical reaction with chlorine on the molecular weight of seb .
