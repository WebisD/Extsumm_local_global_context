we report a clinical case of a patient previously operated on for breast augmentation , who opted for implant replacement and was diagnosed with a unilateral breast xanthoma associated with pip implant rupture .
xanthoma is rarely diagnosed in patients with breast implants and is mainly described in case reports .
in this study , we reported an unusual case of a ruptured pip implant associated with breast xanthoma .
a 30-year - old female was seen by the senior plastic surgeon ( vk ) in january 2015 after bilateral aesthetic breast augmentation in 2007 .
this neoplasm is a rare lesion of the breast and an uncommon complication of pip implant rupture . to the best of our knowledge ,
finally , we also identified a negative impact of implants removal and neoplasm identification on hrqol ; levels of anxiety and depression increased postoperatively , but improved 6 months after the secondary breast augmentation and tumor related reassurance . to summarize , we report a case of breast xanthoma following breast augmentation associated with an asymptomatic microrupture of the pip implant .
current study supports findings of other papers investigating larger cohorts of patients with pip implants ; it also raises awareness of possible risks among individuals without clinical symptoms of implant rupture and leakage of the silicone gel . in asymptomatic patients who would like to keep their pip implants we recommend more intensive clinical surveillance with the breast ultrasound screening .
