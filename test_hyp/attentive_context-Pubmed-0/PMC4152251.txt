arytenoid dislocation after external blunt laryngeal trauma does occur , although rarely , and is often associated with impaired mobility of the vocal cord
impaired movement of the vocal cord was still visible and vocal cords were located almost at the same level , with improved glottic closure in the other 4 patients ( figure 2c , 2d ) .
, we investigated whether it is possible to definitively diagnose and effectively treat arytenoid dislocation due to external laryngeal trauma without using lemg .
furthermore , early closed reduction under local anesthesia is also a practicable and effective treatment option for this kind of disorders as well .
, fiberoptic laryngoscopic and video strobolaryngoscopic examination demonstrated that 5 patients obtained normal movement of the vocal cord and the symmetric position and equal length of both vocal cords , with tight closure of the glottis during phonation instantly after closed reduction ( figure 1c , 1d ) .
97 patients in total were considered to have arytenoid cartilage dislocation , of which 85 ( 87.6% , 85/97 ) had received tracheal intubations . in the current study ,
they were divided into the satisfied group ( n=9 ) and dissatisfied group ( n=3 ) based on patients self - satisfied with voice qualities at 1 week after the last closed reduction manipulation .
