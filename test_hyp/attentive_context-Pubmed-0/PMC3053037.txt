the community health environmental scan survey ( chess ) is an empirical tool developed by the cih evaluation team to systematically document , map ( via gps ) , and assess the environments in which people , shop , live , work , and play as they relate to diet , physical activity , and tobacco use .
the main objective of chess is to improve our understanding of the environment 's that we live in that promote healthy eating , physical activity , and tobacco use and the link between this and a population 's health behaviors and resulting health outcomes .
the results of the cih research project using the chess will provide the first set of evidence of its kind on the complex interplay between behavior and environmental determinants on food consumption patterns , tobacco use , and physical activity levels .
this data illustrates two important functions of chess : ( 1 ) to define the availability and accessibility of healthy food options , and ( 2 ) to guide the development and planning of interventions .
chess is the first environmental assessment tool of its kind to simultaneously assess the three key primary risk factors for chronic disease .
