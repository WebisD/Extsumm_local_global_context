we present the case of a 67-year - old asian woman who had a m. intracellulare infection presenting with multiple cavitating pulmonary nodules , which was differentiated from metastatic lung disease by percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration ( pcna ) .
however , a case of a multiple cavitating nodular infection with neither a fibrotic change nor nodular bronchiectasis associated with m. intracellulare has not been reported .
the ntm most commonly associated with pulmonary infection is the mycobacterium avium complex ( mac ) , which is a microbial complex of mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium intracellulare .
we believe that pcna can be a valuable diagnostic tool for differentiating mtb and mac , and differentiating between malignant diseases and infectious diseases when a pulmonary nodule is revealed on chest radiography or chest ct scans . in conclusion , to the best of our knowledge , this is a very rare report of a mac pulmonary infection presenting with multiple cavitary nodules . as the prevalence of mac infections increases , more cases start to show atypical radiographic findings , compared to the typical apical fibrocavitary or bronchiectatic nodular forms . other forms of mac have been reported , such as spn and multiple nodules . in this report , we present another form of mac pulmonary infection .
