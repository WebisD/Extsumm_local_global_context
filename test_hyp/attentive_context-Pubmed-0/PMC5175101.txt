obese , and healthy control groups were compared , and lymphocyte , and neutrophil ratios were found to be significantly higher in the obese group ( p=0.03 , and 0.045 , respectively ) .
similarly , neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio , and crp levels were found to be significantly higher in the obese group ( p=0.03 , p=0.02 , and p=0.00 ) .
besides , mean platelet volume ( mpv ) was significantly higher in the obese group ( p=0.005 ) . both groups did not differ significantly as for platelet / lymphocyte ratio ( p=0.156 ) biochemical , and hematological parametres measured in healthy controls , and obese individuals p<0.05 statistically significant ; hgb : hemoglobin ; hct : hematocrit ; mcv : mean corpuscular volume ; mch : mean corpuscular hemoglobin ; mchc : mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ; rdw : red blood cell distribution width ; wbc : white blood cell ; mpv : mean platelet volume ; pdw : platelet distribution width ; crp : c - reactive protein .
medical files of the patients who were referred to the outpatient clinics of children s health and diseases of namik kemal university research , and application hospital were analyzed , and height , bodyweight , waist , and hip circumferences of the patients were recorded . among these cases ,
