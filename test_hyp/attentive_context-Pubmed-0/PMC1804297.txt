the current study has been designed to evaluate the presence of ox - ldl accumulation in skin 
 biopsy materials of psoriatic patients .
tc , tg , and ldl - c levels were 
 significantly higher in the male psoriatic patients than in the 
 male control subjects ( p < .05 ) .
tc , tg , and ldl - c levels were significantly 
 higher , but hdl - c levels were lower in the psoriatic patients than 
 in the control subjects .
hdl - c levels were significantly lower in the 
 female psoriatic patients than in the female control subjects 
 ( p < .05 ) .
this capability may directly affect psoriatic epidermis and we believe that the accumulation of 
 ox - ldl in the psoriatic skin may have an important role in 
 pathogenesis of psoriasis .
there was no statistically difference for tc , tg , and 
 ldl - c levels between the psoriatic and the control subjects in the 
 female group ( table 3 ) .
, we found significantly higher levels of tc values in the 
 psoriatic patients ( p < .05 ) .
we found that ldl - c values in the patients with psoriasis were significantly higher than the control group 
 ( p < .05 ) .
