the objective of this study is to compare the measurements of transverse cerebellar and anterior - posterior cisterna magna diameter obtained by 2d and 3dus using the software 3d xi in normal pregnant women between 18 and 24 weeks .
we believe that the great importance of this study is the evaluation of borderline cases , such as an anterior - posterior diameter of the fetal cisterna magna of 9.0  mm and a transverse cerebellar diameter of 16  mm at 18 weeks of gestational age . in these cases the 3dus with the program multislice view can help in decision making between normal and pathological cases , modifying the prenatal , and counseling of the parents . in summary , this was the first study that compared the measurements of the transverse and antero - posterior fetal cerebellum and cisterna magna diameters by 2d- and 3dus using the 3d xi ( multislice view ) software .
there was a high correlation between the measurement of transverse cerebellar diameter by 3dus with gestational age ( r = 0.940 , p < 0.001 ) as well as measures of dbp ( r = 0.927 , p < 0.001 ) and hc ( r = 0.938 , p < 0.001 ) .
