genes , such as dab2ip , dlc-1 , h - cadherin , id4 , integrin 4 , runx3 , sfrp1 , and shp1 , has been identified as being implicated in aberrant dna methylation during development of human malignancy ( 11 - 18 ) . in order to gain insight into the differential epigenetic alterations in leukemia , we investigated the methylation statuses at selected locus of these genes in aml and cml patients using a methylation - specific polymerase chain reaction ( msp ) .
our results suggest that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 may be related to the tumorigenicity of aml and cml and hypermethylation of id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 genes may contribute to the pathogenesis mechanism of aml specifically .
the frequencies of dna methylation of id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 were higher in aml compared to those in cml ( p=0.001 , p<0.0001 , and p=0.001 , respectively ) ( table 2 ) .
in contrast , no statistical differences between aml and cml were detected in other genes such as dlc-1 , dab2ip , h - cadherin , integrin 4 , and runx3 .
the results of the present study demonstrate the substantially increased frequency of promoter hypermethylation in id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 genes in aml compared to cml .
