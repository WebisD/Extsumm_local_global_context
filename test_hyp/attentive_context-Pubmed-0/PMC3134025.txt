we report the first successful use of both complete distal femoral and proximal tibia massive allografts in the reconstruction of large femoral and tibial uncontained defects during revision total knee arthroplasty .
failure of a total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) is often associated with loss of bone from either the proximal aspect of tibia or the distal aspect of the femur .
, we did not find any infection , graft failure or loosening of implant , in spite of using two massive structural allografts in a single revision tka .
the use of dual structural massive allografts provides a stable and durable reconstruction of this uncommon presentation with both femoral and tibial large bone deficiencies encountered during a revision tka . at a five - year follow - up
the application of allografts in revision tka is an attractive option . the use of femoral head allografts for the management of large bone defects in revision tka has been reported .
a 70-year - old male patient , farmer by occupation , presented with a swollen , painful and unstable right knee with primary complaint of inability to bear weight .
few options are available to the surgeon for reconstruction of massive bone defects surrounding a failed total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) .
