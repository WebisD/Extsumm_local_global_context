the stratified analyses also show similar risk estimates for patients not taking oral beta - blockers ; however , the risk in the 31180-day risk period was not statistically significant ( irr = 1.76 ; 95% ci 0.883.50 ) ( table 3 ) .
there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of hospitalisation for bradycardia in the first 30 days after initiating timolol ( incidence rate ratio ( irr ) = 1.40 ; 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 0.872.26 ) .
practitioners should be reminded to carefully examine the patient history before choosing a glaucoma regime and closely monitor patients after treatment initiation with topical nonselective beta - blocker eye drops to minimise adverse events and potentially avoid hospitalisations .
the risk of bradycardia was significantly increased in the 31 to 180 days after timolol initiation ( irr = 1.93 ; 95% ci 1.302.87 ) , but did not remain statistically significantly elevated thereafter ( table 2 ) .
a number of studies have been conducted to confirm the systemic -blocking effects of ophthalmic timolol on cardiovascular functions , including bradycardia , and results varied substantially across studies . randomised controlled trials and crossover studies found a range in reduction of resting heart rate and in peak heart rate during exercise , from negligible to an 11 beat per minute ( bpm ) reduction and from 5 to 22  bpm reduction , respectively , depending on the types of ophthalmic timolol : 0.250.5% aqueous or 0.10.5% hydrogel formulations   . given these findings , we aimed to quantify the potential risks of hospitalisation for bradycardia following initiation of ophthalmic timolol in an elderly population .
