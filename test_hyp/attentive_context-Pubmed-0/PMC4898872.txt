( 1 ) , the present study is among the first reports to evaluate the visfatin level in patients with colorectal adenoma comparing to healthy controls . 


 although visfatin level has been shown to be increased in serums of patients with colorectal cancer , it does not significantly increase in cases with colorectal adenoma .
meansd of visfatin levels in male and female patients were 6.33.01ng / ml and 7.13.05ng / ml , respectively . the visfatin level in the control group was 7.22.41ng / ml and 6.42.59ng / ml for males and females , respectively
* values show possible differences between visfatin levels of patients suffering from adenoma in each part of colon or rectum comparing to the control levels . 


 in this study a total of 69 cases including 34 patients with colorectal adenoma and 35 disease - free controls were enrolled .
, a total of 34 patients diagnosed with colorectal adenoma and 35 disease - free controls were included in case and control groups , respectively .
site of adenoma within the colon or rectum does not seem to play an important role in this regard as well . 

although we found a significant relation between the visfatin level and bmi of patients , we did not detect any relation for hyperglycemia , hypertension ( systolic and diastolic ) and dyslipidemia ( hyper cholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia ) .
