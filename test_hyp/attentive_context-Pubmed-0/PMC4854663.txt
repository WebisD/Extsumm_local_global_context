from now on , molecular study regarding female sexuality has focused on female sexual hormone , like estrogen receptor ( er ) and er derivatives.12 but flibanserin is an agent of 5-hydroxytryptamin ( 5-ht ) type 1a receptor and an antagonist of 5-ht type 2a and thus a new molecular entity.3 flibanserin was originally developed as antidepressant drug . in clinical stage 2a as antidepressant , flibanserin could not prove its effectiveness , but almost no sexual function disorder was reported in subjects . for this reason , the arizona sexual experiences scale ( asex ) was used for making a comparison of the sexual function effectiveness of flibanserin on antidepressant vs. placebo proven in stage 2b studies among four depression programs.4 stage 2b studies have failed to prove its general effectiveness on depression , but in answering this question " how intense is your sexual desire ? " in the asex , flibanserin turned out to be more excellent in both placebo and active - comparator .
since then , drug development has changed its directivity toward being a potential medicine for treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( hsdd ) .
the dsm-5 completed in 2013 addresses new illness called as female sexual interest / arousal disorder ( fsiad ) , which has both properties of hsdd and another illness of dsm - iv known as female sexual arousal disorder .
