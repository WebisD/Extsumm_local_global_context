pcr - sscp analysis implicates amplification of a part of the gene encoding for the specific object , and evaluation of the pcr products of medicine - sensitive and medicine - resistant strains by non - denaturing electrophoresis , in which mutations generally occur in a changed pattern ( 8 , 9 ) . in several parts of the world ,
in this study , we determined the mycobacterial species with multiplex pcr and used pcr - sscp and a direct sequencing analysis for detecting mutations in the dna of the gyra gene of ciprofloxacin resistance in clinical and environmental isolates of nontuberculous mycobacteria in the geographical region of isfahan province in iran . based on a search of all of the available resources and databases in iran
the pcr - sscp patterns of mutated ciprofloxacin - resistant isolates were clearly differentiated from the pcr - sscp patterns of those sensitive to ciprofloxacin .
based on the pcr - sscp results for the qrdr of the gyra gene , two ciprofloxacin - resistant m. abscessus isolates had four similar bands , which were different from mycobacterium fortuitum and m. gordonae isolates .
for each fluoroquinolone - resistant and fluoroquinolone - sensitive mtb isolate , the sscp patterns , in contrast to our results , were indistinguishable on repeated analyses ( 30 ) . in some mycobacterium types , point mutations in the drug - binding locations occur , maintaining their protein function , which leads to the bacteria becoming resistant to the drug , and therefore the protein structure is preserved .
