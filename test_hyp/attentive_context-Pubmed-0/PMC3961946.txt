our earlier studies have shown that glycyrrhiza glabra ( gg ) aqueous root extract treatment ( 2 , 4 and 6 weeks duration of the treatment ) in different age grouped ( 1 and 3 months old ) wistar albino rats enhances both spatial learning ability and retention of learned tasks accordingly , the present study was designed to study the effects of gg root extract on rat hippocampal neurons particularly the ca3 subregion of the hippocampus .
in conclusion , the aqueous root extract of gg in the dose of 150 and 225 mg / kg / p.o showed a significant ( p < 0.01 ) enhancement of dendritic arborization and dendritic intersections in hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons is comparable to the control . based on our results obtained ,
we conclude that constituents present in aqueous extract of root of gg have neuronal dendritic growth stimulating properties .
it may result in alteration in learning and memory the present study showed that the aqueous root extract of gg in the dose of 150 and 225 mg / kg / p.o significant ( p < 0.01 ) enhancement of dendritic arborization and dendritic intersections in hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons .
