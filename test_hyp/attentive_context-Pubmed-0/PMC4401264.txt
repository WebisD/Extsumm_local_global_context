the calcium - sensing receptor ( car ) , a g protein - coupled receptor that signals through gi , gq and sometimes g12/13 pathways , is best known and understood for its role in regulating the secretion and synthesis of parathyroid hormone in response to extracellular ca in the parathyroid glands .
part of the answer is that signalling by receptors through subsets of g proteins represents a common characteristic of many receptors , but that the unique signalling and biologic characteristics of receptors are determined by the additional restricted , and possibly unique proteins with which an individual receptor interacts .
protein interactions have been developed and as more precise analysis of cell signalling has become possible , the inadequacy of the original model has become clear through demonstration that g protein - coupled receptors interact with many intracellular proteins in addition to g proteins .
receptors that act through similar sets of g proteins may have different signalling or biologic effects in different regions of a cell and in different cells .
1 )   . four scenarios in which all g protein - coupled receptors interact with g subunits that regulate standard second messenger generation and other common proteins ( grey triangle , e.g. arrestin ) .
