thus , the aims of the present study were to ( i ) analyze the t - cell subset distribution in sle patients at baseline and ( ii ) determine whether vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy can positively affect their t - cell subset distribution to keep the disease in remission .
vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy appears to positively affect the t - cell subset distribution in sle patients to keep the disease in remission by increasing their cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages .
further studies are needed to examine how the distributions of cd4 th , cd8 ts cells , and other lymphocytes are maintained in sle and to investigate the t - cell - specific cytotoxic mechanisms underlying vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy in sle .
further research should focus on measuring and correlating the levels of cd42h4 th cells , cd8 ts cells , and b - cell autoantibody production as a function of sle activity .
t - cell subset distributions vary across different levels of sle disease activity with higher cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages favoring lower sle activity .
, we analyzed the t - cell subset distributions of both high and low activity sle patients relative to healthy control individuals at baseline ( prior to vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy ) in order to determine whether t - cell subset distributions vary across different levels of sle disease activity .
