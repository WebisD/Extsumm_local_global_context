the aim of this study was to assess the effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine on perioperative haemodynamics and also postoperative recovery in elective surgical procedures with continuous monitoring of depth of anaesthesia by entropy analysis .
dexmedetomidine , when administered as a pre - anaesthetic medication and intraoperative infusion , attenuates stress response to various noxious stimuli and maintains haemodynamic stability . dexmedetomidine 's sedative property delays postoperative recovery , thus continuous monitoring is essential during the first few hours of postoperative period .
after obtaining the approval from institutional ethical committee and written informed consent from patients , 60 patients with asa status i and ii , aged 1855 years , and undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated into two groups : group a ( control group ) : sevoflurane  fentanyl and group b ( test group ) : sevoflurane  dexmedetomidine .
changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( meanse ) : 5 and 10 min after the start of dexmedetomidine ; at induction ; at intubation ; at 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , 45 and 60 min post intubation ; at extubation ; at 5 , 10 , 15 and 30 min post extubation ( da - dexmedetomidine administration ; pi - post intubation ; e - post extubation ; sbp - systolic blood pressure ; dbp - diastolic blood pressure ) postoperatively , the test group showed significant sedation with a mean score of 1.430.50 at 2 h as compared to 1.00.0 of the control group ( p=0.00 ) . the recovery as assessed by modified aldrete 's score was significantly better in the control group ( 10.000.0 ) as compared to the test group ( 8.060.64 ) at 30 min post extubation ( p=0.00 ) . however , modified aldrete 's score significantly improved in the test group at the end of 2 h and was similar to that of control group .
