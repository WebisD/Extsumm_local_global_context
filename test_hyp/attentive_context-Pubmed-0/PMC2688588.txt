we describe a case of a bilateral luxatio erecta that was successfully treated without long - term complications .
bilateral luxatio erecta represents an extremely rare condition , and just a few cases were reported in medical literature . because of a high incidence of related complications such as neurovascular damages early recognition and treatment of this type of dislocation is required by physicians . in this article
a 70-year - old female was accepted in our emergency department because of a bilateral shoulder pain that onsets after a sudden fall happened in her house .
the clinical manifestation is typical and it is characterized by abduction of the affected arm , flexion of the elbow and pronation of the forearm .
are more common than vascular injuries but they tend to resolve after reduction with an excellent prognosis , suggesting the neuropraxia as the main mechanism of the injury   .
inferior dislocations are rare ( 0.5% of all shoulder dislocations ) and bilateral inferior shoulder dislocations are exceptional : only 10 cases have been described so far in the literature . according to the literature , luxatio erecta is due to an indirect mechanism such as a violent abduction force on abducted limb resulting in impingement of the proximal shaft of the humerus against acromion .
