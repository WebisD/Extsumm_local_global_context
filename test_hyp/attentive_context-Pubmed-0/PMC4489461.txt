2011 ) . herein , our 
 findings suggest that cytokine expression can influence the extent of hcv development 
 and provide important insights into cytokine - mediated mechanisms underlying the 
 long - term persistence of hcv . in this context , efforts to determine whether biomarkers , 
 including serum cytokines , can accurately predict the outcome of hcv infection are 
 valuable for establishing better hcv control strategies in latin american regions .
viral and host factors are related to the progression of hcv infection . in 2009 , it was 
 demonstrated that hcv viral clearance is associated with genetic variation in the 
 il-28b gene ( ge et al .
we previously reported the influence of cytokines on the development of distinct 
 clinical courses in children infected with hepatitis a ( fierro et al .
patients with distinct stages of liver disease were included in the 
 study and cirrhosis ( f4 ) was found exclusively in one of these patients ( table ) . 

the progression of hcv infection is associated with the characteristics of lipid 
 profiles in chronic hcv patients .
fibrosis staging 
 determined by elastography was conducted in a small number of participants ( 6 ) from the 
 chronic hcv group .
