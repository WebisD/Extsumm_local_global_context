we have developed a new method of providing the finger with haptic feedback about visual targets in the general environment , by permitting the finger to scan the environment directly to locate those targets .
we have developed this idea , which we call fingersight , through a series of prototypes , exploring the particular application of detecting edges . in the process , we have developed a new spatiotemporal \documentclass[12pt]{minimal }

we have conducted proof - of - concept experiments showing that under active exploration the fingersight device is capable of transmitting visual spatial information through haptic channels . sighted , blindfolded subjects were able to use the device to differentiate between angles separated by as little as 15. performance with the coarser angle set , where responses were separated by 30 showed that fingersight transmitted close to 2/3 of the available information in the stimulus , with most errors being near misses .
