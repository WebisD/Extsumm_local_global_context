we report a case of pseudo - duane 's retraction syndrome caused by entrapment of the medial rectus muscle in an old medial orbital wall fracture presenting very similar clinical features as those of classic duane 's retraction syndrome .
a 15-year - old boy had complained of motility limitation in the right eye since a young age .
duane 's retraction syndrome is a well - known congenital ocular motility disorder caused by anomalous innervation and mechanics of the lateral rectus muscle , with secondary muscle changes sometimes superimposed . in 1976 , thomas duane reported five cases of pseudo - duane 's retraction syndrome showing similar , yet different , symptoms and sign as duane 's retraction syndrome.1 other authors preferred the names of ' inverse duane , reverse duane , or mirror - image duane retraction syndrome ' owing to the presentation of opposing clinical features compared with those of classic duane 's retraction syndrome .
the importance of several tests such as the forced duction test and an imaging study should be emphasized in making the diagnosis for limited eye movement .
recently , a case of innervational etiology , such as bilateral inverse duane 's retraction syndrome , due to simultaneous co - contraction of both horizontal rectus muscles has been reported by khan.9 to the best of our knowledge , there is no report presenting very similar clinical features as those of classic duane 's retraction syndrome arising from the entrapment of the medial rectus muscle in a medial orbital wall fracture .
