specifically , we use an approach of model selection recently introduced by mrquez   to statistically assess patterns of variational modularity across a large sample of rift valley lake cichlids . to determine whether similar patterns of modularity are operating at different levels of biological organization , we also examine craniofacial modularity in each lake separately , as well as within the rock- and sand - dwelling clades of lake malawi .
, we objectively test this hypothesis by comparing multiple combinations of models of cichlid head variational modularity .
this trend strongly supports the hypothesis that this pattern of modularity has influenced the rate and direction of adaptive phenotypic divergence among african cichlid radiations  an idea rooted in the proposal that the cichlid pharyngeal jaw apparatus is a key innovation that freed the oral jaws from a functional constraint , formalized in light of quantitative patterns of trophic divergence among cichlid lineages , and empirically tested here . while our results are compelling , we suggest that the comparisons of rates of evolution to other groups which lack a pharyngeal jaw apparatus ( e.g. , salmonids and characids ) , and possibly a preorbital module , may be needed to confirm whether the patterns of modularity identified in cichlids represent a key innovation .
