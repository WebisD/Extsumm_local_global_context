both colonoscopy and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of a mass near the ileocecal valve . because of continuing bleeding , the patient required laparoscopic - assisted right hemicolectomy to resect the mass .
we present a rare case of an ulcerated ileocecal valve lipoma presenting as lower gastrointestinal bleeding that was treated successfully with laparoscopic resection .
previous cases of ileocecal valve lipomas have been reported in the english literature , with the majority presenting as intussusception or volvulus .
herein , we describe the case of an elderly male who presented with painless hematochezia .
lipomas are the most common benign mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract , with the colon being the most prevalent site .
we believe this is a very rare case of an ileocecal valve lipoma presenting as ulcerations and necrosis leading to acute hemorrhage and urgent resection .
tumors > 2 cm in diameter may occasionally cause nonspecific symptoms , including change in bowel habits , abdominal pain , or rectal bleeding , but with resection the prognosis is excellent .
distribution of alimentary lipomas demonstrates a predilection for the colon , but they may originate anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract , from the hypopharynx to the rectum . often asymptomatic and detected incidentally at the time of colonoscopy or surgery , lipomas
