rectal diclofenac prior to or during ercp in high - risk patients reduces the incidence as well as severity of post - ercp pancreatitis compared to placebo .
we compared various risk factors prior to or during the procedure which might increase the risk of post - ercp pancreatitis like pancreatic cannulation , precut sphincterotomy , suspected sod , pancreatic sphincterotomy , pancreatic duct injection , balloon sphincteroplasty in patients with suspected sod , and difficulty of failed cannulation in both groups .
six out of 200 ( 3% ) patients in rectal diclofenac group developed post - ercp pancreatitis compared to 23 out of 200 ( 11.5% ) patients in placebo group ( fig .
the severity of post - ercp pancreatitis in rectal diclofenac group was mild in all six patients ( 100% ) , while in placebo group , it was severe in four patients ( 4/23 , 17.3% ) , moderate in five patients ( 5/23 , 21.7% ) and mild in 14 patients ( 14/23 , 60.8% ) ( fig .
we conducted a prospective , single - center , open - labeled , randomized placebo - controlled trial evaluating role of rectal diclofenac in prevention of post - ercp pancreatitis in high - risk patients and whether it has any implications on severity of post - ercp pancreatitis .
