comparing the five antigen preparations , the antigen obtained from the 
 epm83 isolate had a reactivity profile similar to the profile observed for the 
 standard antigen ( agb-339 ) against the serum samples from botucatu .
the reaction of agepm83 , associated with high gp43 secretion , with sera 
 non - reactive to the standard antigen in the botucatu and jundia regions suggests 
 that this specific antigen may serve as an alternative when the standard antigen 
 ( agb-339 ) is not capable of detecting circulating anti- p. 
 brasiliensis antibodies in the residents of regions in which the 
 particular species s1 and ps2 occur .
