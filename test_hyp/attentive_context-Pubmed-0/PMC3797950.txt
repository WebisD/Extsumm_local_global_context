now , we report our experiences of three cases of giant colon lipoma that were cleared up after partial resection , together with a literature review .
surgical resection has been considered better suited for giant ( 2 cm ) lesions than endoscopic management , which is highly likely to cause complications such as perforation or bleeding in a giant lesion . with recent breakthrough in endoscopic excision technology , however , reports of successful endoscopic management is increasing even for giant lesions.4 - 6 two endoscopic methods to manage lipoma , complete resection and partial resection ( including unroofing technique ) , have been reported.7 - 9 the difference of effectiveness between these two methods is not proven,9 but partial resection is thought to be much safer than complete resection due to lower chances of complication .
a 65-year - old female was referred to our center due to a giant colon lipoma detected on a colonoscopy .
although surgery is not necessarily the first - line treatment option any more , the following circumstances are good candidates for operation ; in case with wide - base sessile lipoma , unclear diagnosis , intussusception or obstruction , involvement of muscular and serosal layers.15 in conclusion , endoscopic resection could be preferentially recommended for giant lipomas , provided that the lipoma was well - characterized and the procedure was applied safely .
