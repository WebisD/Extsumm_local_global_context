the tip cultures of surgical drains can be an effective means of detection of the postoperative infection
we studied 70 patients who had undergone single - level lumbar discectomy from april 2011 to march 2012 .
although many surgeons are apprehensive about postoperative infection by surgical drainage , no increase in infection rate and no difference in wound healing or postoperative neurological deficit have been observed .
we compared the rates of infection , the levels of crp , and the scores of vas in preoperative , postoperative , and the first postoperative follow - up phases at the outpatients department .
2 ) . the mean level of crp in drainage group on postoperative days 1 , 2 , and 3 were 4.17 , 3.76 , and 2.41mg / l and in nondrainage groups mean level of crp were 4.89 , 5.2 , and
therefore , there is a controversy about usefulness of surgical drain in single - level lumbar disc surgery and that bleeding is not much . in this study
the daily amounts of drainage on the postoperative days 1 , 2 , and 3 were 35.4 , 20.8 , and 14.27ml , respectively ( fig .
