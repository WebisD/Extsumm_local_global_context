a recent report mentioned the dual emergence of chikv and denv in southeastern france and urged the implementation of specific surveillance and response measures to reduce the risk for arbovirus emergence ( 14 ) . since 2006 , a specific chikungunya / dengue national preparation and response plan based on rapid detection and investigation of imported and suspected autochthonous cases , mosquito control measures , and efficiency evaluation in the treated areas has been activated from may through november and then modified after annual debriefing meetings involving all partners . in 2010 , this model proved to be well adapted to the early detection and control of chikv and denv .
albopictus mosquitoes and the successful emergence of chikv in italy and france , reinforced surveillance and response to chikv and denv dissemination should become a higher priority in europe ( 15 ) .
the efficient chikv transmission in italy and southeastern france sheds new light on its dissemination potential in europe from 1 index case , regardless of the viral genetic background and mosquito species in the region of origin of the imported chikv ( 1,10,11 ) . in emerging regions , such as italy and runion island , where the seroprevalence in the population was < 50%
