the subjects were 
 divided into two groups : one sling stabilization exercise group , and one stretching exercise 
 group .
most of the existing studies have mainly focused on comparing stretching with other types 
 of exercises and they have concentrated only on demonstrating that stretching is effective 
 for the treatment of forward head posture . however , very few studies have investigated the 
 effect of training patients to use stretching and sling stabilization exercises in order to 
 treat straight neck symptoms . only a few studies have focused on how to treat straight neck 
 symptoms and correct spinal alignment . hence , this present study was conducted to compare 
 the pre- and post - test results of the craniovertebral angle ( cva ) , the cranial rotation 
 angle ( cra ) , and cervical range of motion ( rom ) , aiming to demonstrate whether or not 
 training by stretching and sling stabilization exercises has any remedial value .
when the pre- and post - test results of the sling stabilization exercise group were compared , 
 a significant difference was found in flexion , right rotation , left lateral bending , and 
 right lateral bending .
when a comparison of the pre- and 
 post - test results was conducted , focusing on changes in cra and cva , the stretching exercise 
 group was found to show a statistically significant changes while the sling stabilization 
 exercise group did not ( table 1table 1.changes in cva and cra of the two groups ( degrees)variablegrouppre - testpost - testcvasling73.16.969.15.4stretching71.36.265.35.2crasling153.011.2148.715.9stretching150.611.2142.710.5values are expressed as mean  standard deviation ; cva : craniovertebral angle ; cra :
