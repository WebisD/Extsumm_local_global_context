however , the effects of glycer - ages on other cancer cells remains poorly understood , and the molecular mechanisms behind their effects have not been clarified .      in the present study , we examined the effects of glycer - ages on cultured human lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells and showed that glycer - ages enhanced their malignancy rather than their proliferation .
, we demonstrated that glycer - ages enhanced the migration and invasion of a549 cells rather than their proliferation .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the interaction of glyceraldehyde - derived ages ( glycer - ages ) , but not glucose - derived ages ( glc - ages ) , with rage elicits oxidative stress generation in numerous types of cells ( vascular wall cells , mesangial cells , schwann cells , and cortical neurons ) , all of which could contribute to the pathological changes seen in diabetic vascular complications of alzheimer 's disease   .
we have recently found that glycer - ages stimulated the growth and migration of cultured human melanoma cells and that anti - rage antibodies inhibited the tumor formation and lung metastasis of melanoma cell xenografts and subsequently improved survival in athymic mice .
