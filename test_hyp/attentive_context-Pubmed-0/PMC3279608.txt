this review represents a non - comprehensive historical overview of the > 5 decade long exploration into the relationships between resident and transient as well as commensal and pathogenic skin microbes .
three major questions that have been addressed with different methods over the decades are : ( 1 ) what microbes are present on the skin surface ? ( 2 ) how does microbial diversity contribute to health and disease states ? and ( 3 ) how do dermatologic practices alter microbial diversity ? . extensive reviews on the current state of skin microbiome research have been recently published ( grice and segre , 2011 ; kong , 2011 ) .
finally , we discuss anticipated progress in the future and potential impact of external factors including antimicrobials on the healthy skin microbiome .
our current society paradoxically strives to colonize our guts with probiotic yogurts , but sterilize our skin with hand sanitizers . rather than direct skin application of live bacterial cultures , we may need to identify emollients or other bacterial products to promote the growth of commensals . with continued expansion of our knowledge of the skin microbiota
antimicrobial therapies are a mainstay of dermatologic practice , but they have associated risks that are not fully characterized .
