the imb model of adherence ( 12 ) , which has been largely used to conceptualize hiv medication adherence ( 1720 ) , was applied to conceptualize the determinants of diabetes medication adherence among a low - income , diverse sample of adults with t2 dm . consistent with the imb model s predictions , adherence information and motivation were associated with adherence behavioral skills , which were , in turn , associated with diabetes medication adherence , and adherence was associated with glycemic control . in short ,
behavioral skills were significantly related to medication adherence , and also mediated the effects of information ( indirect effect 0.08 [ ci : 0.010.15 ] ) and personal motivation ( indirect effect 0.12 [ ci : 0.050.20 ] ) on adherence .
thus , the imb model of adherence may provide a multivariate explanation of nonadherence and guide to promoting medication adherence among people with diabetes . because populations with low ses are at increased risk of nonadherence to diabetes medications ( 24,27 ) , we tested the imb model s predictions in a diverse , low ses sample from a federally qualified health center ( fqhc ) .
consistent with the imb model , we hypothesized that adherence - related information and motivation would determine adherence - related behavioral skills , which , in turn , would determine adherence behavior , and behavior would determine glycemic control .
