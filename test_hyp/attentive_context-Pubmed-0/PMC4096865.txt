a naphthalene derivative was selected as antenna because of ( i ) its 
 high two - photon absorption cross - section , ( ii ) the large spectral overlap between its emission and the absorption 
 of the trans isomer of the aminoazobenzene group 
 in 3 , and ( iii ) its reduced size , to minimize potential 
 steric hindrance effects on the glutamate - binding site of the receptor .
we have rationally designed mag derivatives 
 with visible absorption , fast thermal relaxation , and high two - photon 
 isomerization efficacy based on push  pull substitutions and sensitization of the azobenzene 
 photoisomerization .
we 
 have demonstrated the two - photon activation of azobenzene - based 
 photoswitches in living cells expressing the light - gated receptor 
 liglur . although a symmetrically substituted 
 azobenzene
, a novel scheme 
 was exploited in this compound to enhance its nonlinear optical response , 
 which consists in the introduction of a light - harvesting antenna to 
 sensitize the trans  cis isomerization of the 
 system by absorption of nir radiation and subsequent resonant electronic 
 energy transfer ( ret ) to the trans - azobenzene group . because of its maleimide  azobenzene  glutamate  antenna 
 structure , we named compound 3 as maga2p .
