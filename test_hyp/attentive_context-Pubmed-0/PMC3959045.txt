to our findings , our recommended treatment protocol for thin african corneas provides an initial swelling of the corneal stroma to a value of 450 m , using a drop solution without viscosity additive .
the graphs marked with * are measured after an initial swelling period with solution 6 solution 4 and 5 were applied in the context of our modified treatment procedure , which required an initial swelling of the corneal stroma considerably over 400 m and a subsequent stabilizing of the achieved cct value with an adapted dextran composition .
the treated eyes showed advanced stages of keratoconus with a mean maximum keratometry value of 61  4.3 d ranging from 53.1 to 68.8 d. the mean minimal corneal pachymetry including epithelium was 379  81 m ranging from 266 to 515 m [ table 2 ] .
our findings are not the result of an experimental set - up , but reflect our reactions to the unexpected intraoperative swelling behavior of the treated african corneas .
as keratoconus is a rare disease we have not treated enough patients yet to consolidate the results achieved so far .
caused an intraoperative swelling of the corneal stroma to an average of 172  15% ( n = 5 ) .
