thus , the purpose of this interventional survey was to see the effect of periodontal treatment on levels of serum inflammatory markers crp , tnf- and white blood cell ( wbc ) counts .
the study clearly showed that there was a significant reduction in the levels of serum inflammatory markers ( hscrp and wbc counts ) after periodontal therapy .
the present study was conducted with the purpose of detecting the role of non surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with coronary artery disease .
epidemiological studies have associated plasma levels of il-6 and tnf -  with cardio vascular risk factors and have associated il- 6levels with a risk of cad .
the study is in agreement with the results of previous studies  that stated a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers of inflammation associated with periodontitis post treatment . in this study ,

 poor oral health is detrimental to systemic health.inflammatory markers are significantly associated with periodontitis.periodontitis is a modifiable risk factor , which can be prevented and treated . 
 
cigarette smoking represents the major influential factor with regard to the association between periodontal infections and systemic inflammation , and this preliminary investigation raises the hypothesis of a possible interaction of smoking , periodontal infection and systolic blood pressure on systemic health.third , if periodontitis were the major inflammatory stimulus in at least some patients with periodontitis , severe periodontal infections may represent a major etiologic factor for atherosclerosis , metabolic syndrome , and their sequelae .
