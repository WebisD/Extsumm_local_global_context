nevertheless , since methylation of the same gene has been suggested as a prognostic marker for various tumor types , including different sarcomas , the methylation status of rassf1a holds great potential to differentiate patients with both nf and mpnst into groups of good and poor prognosis .
( n = 12 , p = .003 ) . both mpnsts with methylated and unmethylated rassf1a promoter had lower expression than the benign neurofibromas ( p = .0001 and p = .05 , respectively ) , suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved in silencing the rassf1a gene in mpnst
, we add a detailed study analyzing the promoter methylation of rassf1a . in a large european series of mpnsts we have demonstrated rassf1a to be commonly methylated in this malignancy ( 60% ) , and at a frequency considerably higher than
all normal and benign samples were unmethylated , underscoring that rassf1a promoter methylation is cancer specific . furthermore ,
a multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that methylation status of rassf1a was the strongest predictor of disease - specific survival ( hazard ratio : 5.2 ; 95% ci : 1.419.4 ; p = .013 ) compared with tumor size , metastasis at time of diagnosis , and tumor location ( p = .052 , p = .054 , and p = .076 , respectively ; table  2 ) .
