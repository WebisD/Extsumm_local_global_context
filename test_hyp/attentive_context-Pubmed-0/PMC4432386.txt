this study was conducted on 35 patients who had been diagnosed with sea at the department of neurosurgery in our hospital for 24 years from april 1987 to april 2011 .
the aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics of 35 patients with sea and to disclose the risk factors , treatments and neurologic outcomes .
the patients who underwent either emergent operation within 24 hours or delayed surgery after 24 hours , or conservative management were dealt case by case .
in particular , satisfactory outcomes can be achieved from emergent surgery within 24 hours from diagnosis of sea even if neurological deficit is observed at the time of diagnosis .
their incidence is on the rise because of the various factors such as the increase of the elderly population , intravenous drug use , epidural steroid injection for pain control , epidural anesthesia and development of imaging methods such as computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . with the development of diagnostic radiological evaluations such as ct or mri , rapid and accurate diagnosis has been available , leading to the significant improvement of mortality and morbidity .
and the post treatment mrc scale was 1/5 in 1 patient , 2/5 in 4 patients , 3/5 in 6 patients , 4/5 in 6 patients , and 5/5 in 18 patients ( table 3 ) .
