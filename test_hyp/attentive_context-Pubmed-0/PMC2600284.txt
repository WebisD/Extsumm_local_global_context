this outbreak highlights the importance of lm as an emerging hospital pathogen in patients with underlying diseases and in whom parenteral nutrition may be the source of the initial infection and its spread .
that 42 lm isolates from the first outbreak shared the same genotype and 4 of 6 isolates in the second outbreak also shared the same ( another ) genotype rules out the possibility of endogenous infections among patients and suggests a common source for each outbreak .
every infection with lm could be a yet undetected outbreak and should result in an investigation that focuses on parenteral nutrition or products manufactured in a centralized hospital pharmacy .
enteral and parenteral nutrition has previously been described ( 13,14 ) as a risk factor associated with leuconostoc - infections , although no microbiologic evidence was provided in any of the studies . with regard to previous infections in the multiple logistic regression model ,
one lm strain , isolated from the parenteral nutrition catheter of a patient involved in the 2006 outbreak ( genotype 2 ) , was identical to those isolated from blood of the same patient ( figure 2 ) and from 3 other patients involved in the 2006 outbreak ( data not shown ) .
