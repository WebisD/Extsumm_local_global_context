the present findings did not support previous findings of reduced gray matter volumes in the anterior insula , amygdala , and frontal cortex in mostly older children and adolescents who met diagnostic criteria for odd and/or cd relative to healthy comparison children .
the present findings were consistent with previous findings of an association between high levels of cd symptoms and reduced gray matter volumes in temporal regions , although this association may have been stronger in girls .
the results were qualitatively the same as without this covariate : the quadratic term for the association of the number of cd symptoms with gmv along the left sts ( 63 , 12 , 9 ) remained significant , f(2 , 103 )  =  13.61 , p  =  0.05 , k  =  5 , with fwe whole - brain correction , as did the trend in the right sts ( 56 , 45 , 9 ) , f(2,103 )  =  10.74 , p  <  .001 uncorrected , k  =  1453 .
therefore , we test the general hypothesis based on previous studies that individual differences in regional gmv will be found to be associated with the disruptive behavior disorders in a sample of 911  year old girls and boys .
