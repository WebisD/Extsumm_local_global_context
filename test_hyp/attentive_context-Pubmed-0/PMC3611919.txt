we are reporting two such rare cases of spontaneous extrusion of the peritoneal catheter through the intact abdominal wall .
ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( vps ) surgery is the commonly used technique for the management of hydrocephalus in pediatric cases .
extrusion of the peritoneal end of the shunt through intact abdominal wall is extremely rare and few cases have been reported in the literature .
a high range of complications has been reported following this procedure , which are troublesome either to the surgeon or to the patient .
disconnection of the peritoneal catheter from the chamber and pulling out the extruded catheter through the abdominal wall is suggested as a simple and effective method of removal of the shunt .
a 7-month - old female baby was admitted to neurosurgical department of s.c.b . medical college and hospital with the vps catheter 's distal end protruding through the intact abdominal wall [ figure 1 ] .
we suggest that the firm tip of the catheter coupled with its movements with respiration produced a hammer effect and eroded the abdominal wall caused local inflammation , and then extruded through the skin .
spontaneous extrusion of the distal peritoneal catheter through the intact abdominal wall a 14-year - old boy presented with extrusion of peritoneal end of the vps catheter through the intact abdominal wall [ figure 2 ] .
