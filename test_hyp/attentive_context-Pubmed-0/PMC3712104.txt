therefore , it is suggested that the procedure we used is a reliable method for recovery of both liver and intestinal flukes from humans .
the present study was performed to determine the actual status of infection with foodborne trematodes by recovery of adult flukes from riparian people of saravane and champasak province , lao pdr .
kaen , thailand , a hyperendemic area of opisthorchiasis , reported that the worm load of o. viverrini among 181 human autopsy cases averaged 182.4 and ranged from 1 - 2,946 per individual . in our previous studies in savannakhet and vientiane , the average worm load measured by worm recovery after praziquantel treatment and purging was 115.4 ( n=29 ; 0 - 1,350 per individual ) and 57.8 ( n=18 ; 3 - 315 per individual ) , respectively
the most highly prevalent was ste , which included eggs of o. viverrini , heterophyids , and lecithodendriids , with a prevalence of 69.9% ( 46.5 - 87.2% by district ) and 46.3% ( 7.5 - 73.9% by district ) in saravane and champasak province , respectively ( table 1 ) .
these observations indicate that if a person is infected with o. viverrini , a majority , if not all , of the worms are expelled by this procedure . a previous study in thailand supports this hypothesis ; in 9 patients treated with 40 mg / kg praziquantel in a single dose followed by purging and whose diarrheal feces were collected at least 24 hr after purgation , 95% of all worms were expelled within the first 4 hr . a study performed in khon
