interstitial nephritis is a possible complication of hiv infection.8,9 it is usually caused by drugs such as indinavir , foscarnet , abacavir , and co - trimoxazole ; mycobacterial infections ; infections by other viruses ; or dysimmune syndromes such as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome ( dils ; table 1).10,11 interstitial nephritis might occur as a direct consequence of hiv infection , but cases demonstrating this through exclusion of other etiologies are rare . herein , we present a case of interstitial nephritis that was likely caused directly by hiv infection and not by other etiologies .
kidney diseases are common in hiv - infected patients.17 the most common one is hiv - associated nephropathy ( hivan ) , as well as drug toxicities of various kinds .
we identified interstitial nephritis without glomerular lesions in a treatment - naive hiv - infected patient , which was considered to be a complication of hiv infection . to our knowledge , the occurrence of interstitial nephritis in hiv - infected patients without other etiologies is rare , given the lack of similar reports .
the findings presented herein are rare and should be further investigated to understand the potential role of interstitial nephritis on the prognosis of hiv infection .
