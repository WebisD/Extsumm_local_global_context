treatment with insulin after infection improved some of these complement effectors compared with persistent hyperglycemia .
however , our prior in vitro findings and present demonstration of decreased complement opsonization of s. aureus in vivo suggest that hyperglycemic inhibition of complement responses to s. aureus likely contributed to decreased phagocytosis and increased bacterial survival for diabetic rats . in summary , these rat experiments show that hyperglycemia inhibited humoral effector recruitment , complement - mediated opsonization of s. aureus , and complement anaphylatoxin generation ( figure 7 ) .
our results were consistent with prior reporting that diabetic patients have a decreased ability to fix complement by igg . in order to measure the extent to which a hyperglycemic environment altered complement - mediated immune effectors against s. aureus infection in vivo
hyperglycemia adversely affected the early ( i.e. , 2-hour ) influx of critical humoral immune components to the site of s. aureus infection .
these experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of hyperglycemia on complement effectors against s. aureus in a rat model of peritoneal infection .
previous investigators have evaluated s. aureus foot - pad infection in a nod diabetic mouse model , but the mice were c5-deficient limiting the ability to evaluate complement - mediated effects .
