although dfa has mainly been used in patients with diabetes , several papers suggest that there is a progressive fall in complexity ( i.e. , increase in dfa ) as a patient walks his way from health , through the prediabetes states to full - blown type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm )   . the present study intends to analyse the characteristics of the dfa crossover point in a population with high risk of becoming diabetic and to find out if these characteristics may have any influence on the risk of developing t2 dm .
the characteristics of the crossover phenomenon have predictive value for the development of t2 dm in patients at risk and may provide a sensitive and easy way to explore the earliest signs of glucoregulatory failure .
similarly , neither the dfa of the first nor the second limb ( before and after the crossover ) alone had significant influence on the hazard rate of developing t2 dm ( dfa1 :  = 0.475 , p = 0.735 ; dfa2 :  = 1.452 , p = 0.279 ) , but they both became significant when adjusting for the crossover point ( dfa1 :  = 4.876 , p = 0.018 ; dfa2 :  = 4.050 , p < 0.001 ) .
