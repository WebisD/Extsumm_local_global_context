thus , cell - free urinary microrna-214 might be a useful noninvasive biomarker for the recurrence of nmibc .
in the univariate cox regression analysis , the number of tumors ( especially 8 ) and the levels of mir-214 were influential factors in the recurrence of nmibc ( hazard ratio [ hr ] , 2.636 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.220 to 5.699 ; p=0.014 ; hr , 2.231 ; 95% ci , 1.175 to 4.238 ; p=0.014 , respectively ) .
low levels of urinary mir-214 can be used as an independent prognostic parameter for the recurrence of nmibc .
accordingly , it has been suggested that mirnas play roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the tumorigenesis and progression of bladder cancer . however , although many mirnas , their targets , and their mechanism of action as well as their clinical value have recently been described , few studies have focused on cell - free mirnas isolated from urine , particularly in bladder cancer . in the present study , we measured the expression levels of urinary cell - free mir-214 in nmimc patients and then investigated whether urinary cell - free mir-214 could be a prognostic biomarker for nmibc .
