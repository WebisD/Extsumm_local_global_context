the short duration of the assay and its specificity were clear bonuses for routine analysis of guaifenesin and dropropizine in their pharmaceutical formulations and in - process quality control .
n hcl ( personal contact ) : bromhexine hcl ( br ) , 2-amino-3,5-dibromo - n - cyclohexyl - n - methylbenzylamine hydrochloride ; n-(2-amino-3,5-dibromobenzyl)-n - methylcyclohexylamine hydrochloride : the aim of the present paper is to develop a simple and accurate method for the determination of dropropizine and guaifenesin that permits their analysis in dosage forms without interference from excipients and other coformulated drugs .
  the proposed colorimetric method is selective for polyhydroxy aliphatic compounds , simple and rapid as it takes from 15 to 20 minutes for the sample to be ready for measurement .
repeatability and reproducibility of the instrumental response ( absorbance of the formed color ) were checked during method development and they were assessed from five replicate determinations of sample solutions of gf and dr at the concentration of 30  g ml .  
only two gc - mass spectrometry methods have been reported for the determination of dp in biological fluids   in addition to a manufacturer procedure that involves the determination of dropropizine by measuring its uv absorbance at 237  nm in 0.05
