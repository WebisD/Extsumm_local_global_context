in a recent article in genome research , thompson and colleagues present a development of a next - generation sequencing technology - the heliscope sequencer - that enabled them to detect mutations in the human breast cancer 1 ( brca1 ) gene , as a model of a clinical diagnostic protocol .
it therefore holds great promise for overcoming the emerging problem in clinical genetics of target overload : the presence of a large number of gene mutations of clinical relevance in a single disease entity . in no field is this challenge more apparent than in the genomics of cancer .
we would like to thank claire pike and karen howarth for helpful discussion and reading of the manuscript and the wellcome trust translational medicine and therapeutics program , breast cancer campaign and cancer research uk for funding .
, this approach provides an opportunity to truly begin integrating the vast quantity of genomic data generated in this next - generation era with clinical practice .
for the foreseeable future , the high cost and complexity of data analysis will limit the application of whole - genome sequencing for the detection of mutations in a clinical setting .
the advent of next - generation technologies ( such as the roche 454 gs flx+ , llumina hiseq 2000 , applied biosystems solid and heliscope single - molecule sequencer machines ) , which allow a human genome to be sequenced in a single week - long run , has led to a large shift in our understanding of the mutations that drive cancers . for the clinician , mutations in cancer can have relevance for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment choice .
