nevertheless , there is no reason for premature pessimism , as revealed by current ongoing trials and the clinical developmental status of anti - angiogenic drugs .
the relationships of angiogenesis with cancer have special relevance , since angiogenesis has been described as one of the hallmarks of cancer , playing an essential role in tumour growth , invasion , and metastasis .
angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting of pre - existing ones , is a main mechanism of vascularization during embryonic development , growth , formation of the corpus luteum and endometrium , regeneration and wound healing .
the complex sequence of events involved in angiogenesis is related to changes in endothelial cell biosignalling .
since tumour blood vessels show many differences from normal vessels and are not genetically unstable , they are potential targets for therapy of all types of cancer . due to the pivotal role played by endothelial cells in tumour angiogenesis ,
these include flaws in the methods used to select these inhibitors and in the design of the clinical trials to test their effects , as well as an oversimplified view of tumour vasculature pathophysiology .
national cancer institute database showed that in august 1999 a total of 20 angiogenesis inhibitors were being tested in clinical trials . remarkably , most of them were monotherapies with the antiangiogenic agent , and those compounds that had then reached the phase iii , including several inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases , were discontinued due to their lack of activity or the appearance of undesirable toxicities . in spite of the great number of angiogenesis inhibitors described so far ( estimated to be > 300 drug candidates in 2001 ) , and the interesting results obtained in experimental models , even showing complete tumour regressions in pre - clinical studies , modest or even negative results emerged from the first generation of compounds entered in clinical trials .
