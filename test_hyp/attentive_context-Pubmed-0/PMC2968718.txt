this study sought to assess alterations in the ultrastructure and energy metabolism of masticatory muscles of rats under psychological stress .
the masseter muscle is useful in this type of research because there are large amounts of spindles in these muscles , which are critical in determining muscle contraction and mandibular movement in response to stimulation .
psychological stress can cause mitochondrial injuries and hyperemia of the masticatory muscle capillaries in rats .
the rats were then randomly divided into control ( con ) , foot - shocked ( fs ) , and psychological stress ( ps ) groups , with each group having 16 rats .
with regard to energy metabolism in the masticatory muscles , na - katpase activity in the masticatory muscles decreased significantly from 7.60  0.50  mol pi / mg protein / hour in the control group to 4.10  0.53  mol pi / mg protein / hour in the   ps rats after three weeks of stimulation and even decreased from 7.15  0.35  mol pi / mg protein / hour in the control group to 2.50  0.32  mol pi / mg protein/ hour in the ps group after five weeks of stimulation ( p < .05 ) ( figure 5(a ) ) . similarly , ca - atpase activity of the masticatory muscles decreased from 8.38  0.23 and 8.47  0.37  pi / mg protein / hour in the control group to 3.82  0.58  mol  pi / mg protein / hour ( p < .05 ) and to 2.14  0.43  mol  pi / mg protein / hour ( p < .05 ) in the ps rats after three and five weeks of stimulation , respectively , ( figure 5(b ) ) . by contrast , the activities of ldh and the contents of ld , respectively , significantly increased from 32.41  2.35 ( u / g protein ) and 0.67  0.10  mmol / g protein in the control group to 85.13  9.63 ( u / g protein ) and 1.25  0.19  mmol / g protein in the ps group after three weeks of stimulation ( p < .05 ) and even increased to 128.69  10.19 ( u / g protein ) and 1.97  0.33 mmol / g protein in the ps group after five weeks of stimulation ( p < .05 ) ( figures 5(c ) and 5(d ) ) .
