the experiments were conducted in rats under very deep urethane anesthesia , a condition that reduces spontaneous activity , as indexed by a burst - suppression pattern of electrocorticographic ( ecog ) activity and long ( up to several seconds ) periods to cessation and neuronal firing (  down - states  ) at the level of the cortex and lgn   . to increase background neuronal activity , animals received electrical stimulation of the brainstem pedunculopontine reticular formation ( rf ) , which exerts a powerful activating effect over the forebrain by eliciting generalized ecog activation and increasing the discharge rates of cortical neurons   .
spontaneous neural activity can be expected to differ substantially between various experimental preparations ( e.g. , in vitro , in vivo anesthetized , in vivo conscious , and behaving ) and might therefore constitute one of the factors that account for the difference in ltd induction seen in prior work . here , we examined if manipulating the levels of spontaneous , cortical activity alters the probability and/or magnitude of ltd at v1 synapses induced by lfs of the lgn ; as discussed , prior work has demonstrated a high degree of resistance of this fiber system against ltd induction in vivo   .
