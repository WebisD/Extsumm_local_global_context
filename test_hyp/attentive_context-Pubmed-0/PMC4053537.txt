we utilized the energy balance between 
 the precession entropy s and 
 free energy of membrane deformation gdef to derive an equation of state describing 
 the dependence of the tilt on the helix length and membrane thickness . 

following previous works on tilting under 
 hydrophobic mismatch 
 conditions , we demonstrated 
 that precession entropy can contribute to the tilting of tm helices 
 under conditions of perfect match and negative mismatch , despite the 
 unavoidable membrane deformation .
hydrophobic match or mismatch in transmembrane 
 ( tm ) helices ( or 
 proteins ) refers to the match or mismatch between the length of the 
 hydrophobic core of the helix and the native thickness of the hydrocarbon 
 region of the membrane ( figure 1 ) .
notably , 
 our simple theoretical model managed to reproduce the 
 tilt angles observed for 17 different peptides in membranes of various 
 thicknesses .
this supports the model s underlying assumption , 
 namely , that the tilt is determined by the free energy balance between 
 the helix precession entropy and lipid perturbation .
thus , the equation of state 
 can be used for a quick estimation of the helix tilt .
however , one 
 should take into account that the 17 peptides are synthetic and very 
 similar to each other .
