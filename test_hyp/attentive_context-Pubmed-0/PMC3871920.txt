the results of this study may support the theory of lower endothelial cell density and thicker cornea in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus .
the aim of our study was to compare the endothelial cell density and central corneal thickness in diabetic and nondiabetic patients and to evaluate the local and systemic factors which may affect the corneal endothelium in this group .
the mean endothelial cell density in patients with diabetes was 2435.55  443.43  cells / mm and was significantly lower than in the control group ( 2970.75  270.1  cells / mm ) ( p = 0.0001 ; mann - whitney test ) .
duration of diabetes is the factor that affects ecd and cct and observed changes could predispose to corneal dysfunction in the future .
for the purpose of this study  we examined 123 eyes of 123 patients with type 1 diabetes ( 60 boys and 63 girls ) .
the mean cct value in patients with duration of diabetes up to 5 years was 0.539  0.027  mm , with duration of diabetes from 5 to 10 years was 0.551  0.03  mm , and with duration of diabetes over 10 years was 0.558  0.03  mm , and the differences were statistically significant ( p value = 0.0144 ; anova test ) .
