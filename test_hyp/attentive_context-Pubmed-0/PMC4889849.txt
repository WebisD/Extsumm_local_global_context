determination of acetone levels in blood may be a valid clinical approach in the symptomatic or / and nonsymptomatic cases in the literature for determining treatment strategy and controlling glycemic levels of patients .
, it is proposed that liquid chromatography with fluorescence ( lc - fl ) seems to be useful for the determination of acetone in the saliva . in this paper , we present a rapid and simple hplc technique using 2,4-dnph as a derivatizing reagent for quantitative determination and metabolomic research of acetone in biological fluid such as human blood .
higher levels of acetone have been measured in the patients who have high level of blood glucose and positive urine ketone ( group 1 ) .
the determination was carried out using a uv - vis dad detector with hplc . in most of our patients ' blood samples ,
the hplc chromatogram of 15  mmol  l acetone in human blood in the first patient of group 1 is given in figure 3 . in our study , the patients were determined as high blood glucose and urine ketone positive subjects ( group 1 ) and high blood glucose and urine ketone negative example subjects ( group 2 ) .
