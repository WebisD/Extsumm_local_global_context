our observations support the usefulness of bev as a new treatment option for patients with recurrent hgg taken into account the absence of alternative treatment options with proven activity .
we conclude that our analysis of the first experience with bev for the treatment of patients with recurrent hgg is in line with the reported tolerability and activity of this new treatment from prospective clinical studies .
the six - month progression - free survival rate ( 6mpfs% ) was 21% ( 95% ci 2.739.5 ) , and the 6mos% was 47.4% ( 95% ci 24.869.9 ) .
likewise , flt - pet has been correlated with clinical outcome of patients treated with the combination of irinotecan and bevacizumab . in our series ,
were correlated with an improved overall survival in patients treated with irinotecan and bev   . on 19 november 2009 , the chmp ( ema ) refused to change the terms of the marketing authorization for bevacizumab in the eu to include recurrent glioblastoma .
this paper reports the first experience with bevacizumab for recurrent glioma in patients treated at two brussels university hospitals .
the objective tumor response , either analyzed by gadolinium - enhanced t1 mri and/or t2/flair imaging , was interestingly high in our patient population . reflecting the poor baseline prognostic characteristics of our population , both time to progression ( ttp ) and overall survival ( os ) , in contrast , were low when compared to published series .
