furthermore , the results of the present study can not be extrapolated to the use of autologous blood transfusion since it is assumed that all studies included in the meta - analysis reported outcomes in patients transfused with mainly allogeneic blood . in conclusion , perioperative bt may be associated with reduced rfs , css , and os in patients undergoing rc for bc .
the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that none of the studies included in the meta - meta - analysis was very influential , as the hr ranged from 1.20 to 1.30 , 1.24 to 1.34 , and 1.18 to 1.26 for os , css , and rfs , respectively , for the pooled meta - analysis and all omitted meta - analyses ( table 2 ) .
we conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta - analysis to test for an association between perioperative bts and recurrence - free , cancer - specific , and overall survival in patients undergoing rc .
the i test demonstrated moderate heterogeneity ( 60% , p = 0.012 ) across the studies .
the i test demonstrated moderate to substantial heterogeneity ( 68.3% , p = 0.0014 ) across the studies . seven studies including a total of 14,878 patients estimated cancer - specific survival in the statistical analysis ( table 1(b ) )
