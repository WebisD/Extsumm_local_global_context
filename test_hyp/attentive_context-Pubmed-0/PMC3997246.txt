we present the case of a 53-year - old woman with a clinically benign nodular cutaneous lesion that revealed histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of adenomyoepithelioma .
adenomyoepithelioma has been described as a rare benign neoplasm that occurs almost exclusively in the breast . in the breast
a 53-year - old woman presented to her dermatologist with a 3 cm asymptomatic nodule on the left forearm .
these neoplasms seem to be exceedingly rare , with only few reports of adenomyoepitheliomas published to date   .
it is defined as a neoplasm composed of two structures , namely , tubules limited by an inner epithelial layer of duct - like cells and an outer layer with mostly clear myoepithelial cells .
apart from the breast , adenomyoepitheliomas have been described in the salivary glands and in the lung . in the skin ,
we describe a cutaneous neoplasm composed of myoepithelial cells and a focal epithelial and glandular component .
the most important question for the patient is the biologic potential of such a lesion . while the chronic course in our patient and the majority of the histopathologic features suggest a benign neoplasm , foci of cells having pleomorphic nuclei and mitotic figures were present .
