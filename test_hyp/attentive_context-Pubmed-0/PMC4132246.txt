measurements of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide using passive sampler over 12  months in samsun , turkey , are compared with so2 and no2 concentrations obtained from a co - located chemiluminescence analyzer .
since the results obtained from both passive samplers and uninterrupted measurements are significantly low , we should consider the possibility of errors arising from factors having an impact on sulfur dioxide measurements and devices used .
the uninterrupted measurement station values and passive sampler readings are compared at the measurement station of the ministry of forestry and water works . a correlation of 69.24%
it is observed that the sulfur dioxide distribution heads from south to north - west , towards the black sea from measurement station number 5 .
according to this correlation , the annual nitrogen dioxide average is calculated as 42.36  g / m .
4 . when the passive samplers are compared with uninterrupted measurement results at the measurement location number 3 , in terms of sulfur dioxide , a correlation could not be established .
the concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen dioxide in the ambient air during the period from november 2009 to september 2010 are analyzed .
the highest value for annual no2 and so2 averages of passive sampler was 29.65  g / m and 21.01  g / m for exposures of 2-weeks at an industrial site .
