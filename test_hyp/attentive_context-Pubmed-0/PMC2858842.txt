therefore , the authors present a case of mrtk combined with mcdk in a 5-yr - old girl with a literature review .
a 5-yr - old girl who was previously diagnosed with mcdk at birth by abdominal sonography presented with a huge palpable mass on the right side of her abdomen .
the authors believe that this case , mcdk combined with mrtk found in an infant , is the first of its kind to be reported , and we consider that this occurrence can become a new disease entity in infantile renal disease in the future . according to the literature ,
multicystic dysplastic kidney ( mcdk ) is a relatively common developmental anomaly in infants and children , and its overall prognosis is good in older children .
however , a combined case of these two diseases has not been reported to date .
although mcdk is grossly " cystic " in appearance , it is not one of the inherited renal cystic diseases , but a kind of renal dysplasia , in which cystic elements are found along with immature , undifferentiated , primitive tissue ( 1 ) . in contrast , a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney ( mrtk ) is one of the most lethal neoplasms of early life , and the mortality rate exceeds 80% ( 2 ) .
