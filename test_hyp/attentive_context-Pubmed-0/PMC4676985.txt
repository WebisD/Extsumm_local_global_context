, we showed that lyta gene was the most frequent genes among the s. pneumoniae isolates , and combination of rrga , lyta was the most observed pattern.thus this should allow for appropriate screening of adhesin - based vaccines to prevent infections by streptococci .
thus , in this study the presence of three genes were detected among the isolates of s. pneumoniae .
five patterns of these genes were seen among s. pneumoniae isolates : lyta ( n=33 , 55.93% ) , rrga ( n=2 , isolates , 3.38% ) , pspc ( n=1 1.69% ) , lyta+rrga ( n=16 , 27.11% ) and lyta+ rrga+ pspc ( n=1 , 1.69% ) .
distribution of the lyta , rrga and pspc genes among isolates of s.pneumoniae were determined .
rrga and pspc were also found in17 ( 28.81% ) , and 2 ( 3.38% ) isolates respectively .
we concluded that the gene cpsa was specific and highly conserved among s. pneumoniae isolates which were colonized in nasopharynx . on the other hand
among 260 nasopharanx samples from healthy children under 6 years , 59 isolates were confirmed as s. pneumoniae .
a total of 260 samples from nasopharynx of healthy children under 6 years old were taken carefully and transferred under cold condition to the laboratory .
