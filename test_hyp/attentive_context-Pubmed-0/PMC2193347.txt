therefore , in this report we have investigated whether caspases could play a role during erythroid differentiation .
further exploration of the role of caspases in erythroid cells and other hematopoietic lineages would be of major interest for understanding the fate ( differentiation versus apoptosis ) of hematopoietic cells upon different physiological or pathological conditions .
recently , the nuclear protein acinus was shown to play a role in chromatin condensation associated with apoptosis when cleaved by caspase-3 27 .
these two findings excluded the possibility that activation of caspases may favor erythroid maturation by inducing apoptosis in a subset of erythroid cells and strongly suggested that inhibition of red cell formation by z - vad - fmk was not due to a selection of immature nonapoptotic cells .
caspases are only transiently activated during erythroid differentiation process , suggesting that regulatory mechanisms prevent further amplification of the proteolytic process that would lead to the cell demise . upon epo deprivation or fas activation , the transient caspase activity is amplified via either the mitochondrial / caspase-9 or the caspase-8 pathway , respectively , and lead to apoptosis . therefore , in this report we have described a new function for caspases as enzymes critical for erythroid differentiation .
