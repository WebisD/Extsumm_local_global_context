additionally , the damage sensitivity of the h3.3 cells may also be related to its ability to promote transcriptional recovery after repair , possibly through its ability to interact  specifically with components of the fact chromatin remodeling complex , which has itself been implicated in transcriptional recovery after ner and in resistance to uv damage .
h3.3 is incorporated throughout the cell cycle   , particularly in regions of the genome in which histones need to be displaced , such as transcribed genes or regulatory elements   .
finally , how might h3.3 incorporation facilitate subsequent dna repair and survival ? because it has been proposed that h3.3-containing chromatin has a more open and accessible structure , its incorporation may be particularly important for promoting ner in highly condensed regions of the genome . 
recently , h3.3 has also been implicated in the response to ultraviolet ( uv ) irradiation , because its chaperone hira is required to promote transcription restart after uv damage . in order to examine the effect of complete loss of h3.3 in a differentiated vertebrate cell line
indeed , such damage - dependent specificity is now well documented in translesion synthesis   and , recently , damage caused by uv and by mms has been shown to induce quite distinct bypass responses in human cells . however , much further work is needed to understand the contexts in which h3.3 is required for processive replication of damaged dna .
