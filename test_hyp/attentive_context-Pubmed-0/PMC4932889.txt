all results of this study were consistent with the hypothesis that emblemasoma erro uses the acoustic sexual signals of its hosts as a means for locating potential mates . in the field , both male flies and nongravid female flies performed positive phonotaxis to acoustic stimuli mimicking the calls of their host cicadas .
emblemasoma 
 erro and olfactory eavesdroppers with analogous mate - finding behaviors demonstrate that for at least some eavesdropping parasitoids , insect communication signals do not merely provide an efficient way to find potential hosts 
the call of n. dorsatus is also a  love song  that both male and female e. erro exploit as a means for finding mating opportunities .
this study reveals that the acoustic signals of n. dorsatus serve yet another purpose in e. erro s life cycle . for these flies ,
signal amplitude had a strong effect on the number of flies captured by a trap ( p  <  0.001 ) , but amplitude had no effect on the proportions of male and female flies that were trapped ( interaction of amplitude and fly sex : p  =  0.386 ) .
once male flies arrived at a sound source , they pursued and tried to mate with other flies that were also attracted to the acoustic stimulus . although it was not known with certainty whether the nongravid female flies captured in this study were seeking mating opportunities , these flies were obviously incapable of parasitizing hosts , and the observation of three mating pairs in the field indicates that at least some sexually receptive females perform phonotaxis to cicada calls .
