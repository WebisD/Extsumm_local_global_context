this study examined the association of imat of the thigh , along with muscle lean tissue and muscle strength , with mobility measures in older adults .
the novel finding in this investigation is that even when accounting for total body mass , thigh muscle adipose tissue surfaces as a potent muscle variable related to the ability of older adults to move about in their community . specifically , normalized muscle strength , imat and lean tissue composition measured via mri were tested to determine the contribution of these muscle variables to declining mobility levels in older adults .
skeletal muscle lipid content in older men and women is independently associated with maximal torque production even after adjusting for muscle size , height , weight , age , and race , accounting for 3236% of the total variance in strength .
these results support the use of step - wise regression analyses to examine the unique and shared contributions of the muscle variables towards explaining the variance in mobility measures .   the multiple regression analysis on the 6mw revealed that the predictors as a group accounted for 34.6% of the variance in walk distance , with strength ( p = 0.005 ) , imat ( p = 0.002 ) , and lean ( p = 0.005 ) each significantly contributing to the final model ( p = 0.005 ) .
