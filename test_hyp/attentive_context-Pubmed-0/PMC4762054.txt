to address this need , using data from the immediate trial , we used logistic regression to develop a predictive model to stratify the risk of cardiac arrest or death among patients presenting with suspected acs .
this immediate trial - based predictive model appears to accurately identify patients with suspected acs who are at high risk of cardiac arrest or death and who could benefit most from gik . that the model 's risk factors include earliness of treatment
the odds of the composite outcome cardiac arrest or in - hospital mortality related to gik was 0.45 ( ci 0.24 , 0.83 , p = 0.01 ) . assuming a constant odds ratio across the spectrum of calculated risk , the predicted absolute risk reduction was much more pronounced for the high - risk group compared to the low - risk group ( 8.6% vs. 0.8% ) , with corresponding numbers needed to treat ( nnt ) of 12 and 125 respectively .
once the model has been validated in other datasets and in practice , it could be helpful in identifying patients most likely to deserve immediate attention and acute interventions for acs , including very early out - of - the - hospital gik .
