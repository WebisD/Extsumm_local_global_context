the pcr has shown very promising results for early and rapid diagnosis of the disease due to its detection limit of one to 10 bacilli in various clinical specimens.6 the present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of different laboratory diagnostic modalities along with the role of pcr in the diagnosis of clinicoradiological suspected cases of pott 's disease .
as culture takes long incubation time for results , the combination of pcr and histopathology can be applied for rapid detection of pott 's disease . to conclude , for diagnosis of pott 's disease , the combined results of zn microscopy , bactec culture and histopathology are most appropriate . however , for rapid diagnosis the combination of pcr amplification and histopathology offer a better prospect .
zn microscopy method is a popular technique routinely used in the clinical laboratories worldwide , due to its simplicity , cost effectiveness and rapidity , but it suffers with low sensitivity and requires 10 to 10 bacilli / ml in the clinical specimens to be positive.34 the culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis ( m. tuberculosis ) is a gold standard method for diagnosis but it also has limitations like that required 6 to 8 weeks due to the slow growth of m. tuberculosis and is often negative , it still needs 10 -10 bacilli / ml ( live bacilli ) in clinical specimens for culture recovery and also stringent test conditions that is difficult to implement at primary or secondary clinical laboratories.56 moreover , histopathological examination plays a valuable role in the diagnosis of pott 's disease but sometime it may be inconclusive and in addition need high expertise and the final reporting also takes more than 1 week.6 recently , the molecular biology technique , polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) represents a major advance in the diagnosis of tb.6 with the use of amplification systems , nucleic acid sequences unique to m. tuberculosis can be detected directly in clinical specimens , offering better accuracy than zn microscopy and greater speed than culture .
