when axial loading or oblique loading was applied , the highest level of stress was observed on the implant - bone interface and peri - implant bones in a single rp implant and the lowest stress distribution was exhibited in 2si conditions .
the stress distributions based on various bone levels and implant installation conditions in a severely atrophied maxillary posterior area were analyzed .
the highest level of stress was concentrated on the implant / abutment - contacting surface of the single wide implant and the lowest level of stress was on the implant / abutment complex of 2sis .
a 5-year clinical study demonstrated the clinical success of 2sis.24 the purpose of this study was to compare the stress distribution of various types of 2sis that were installed and restored in severely atrophied maxillary molar sites .
in addition , stress on the implant - abutment complex was analyzed to estimate the risk of fracture in a narrow implant .
the single rp implant group showed the highest level of stress at the implant - bone interface .
the stress distribution at the implant - bone interface was compared by categorizing the bone levels into two ( flat and stepped ) .
