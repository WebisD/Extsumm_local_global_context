the findings of the present study showed that gray mta and portland cement had better sealing ability than white mta when used as apical plugs .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the sealing ability of apical plugs made of white and gray mta - angelus ( angelus solues em odontologia , londrina , pr , brazil ) and white portland cement ( votorantim cimentos , votorantim , so paulo , sp , brazil ) placed via the root canal and having different thicknesses ( 2 , 5 and 7 mm ) .
tables 3 , 4 and 5 show the results of the kruskal - wallis statistical test for comparison among groups a ( mta - angelus gray ) , b ( mta - angelus white ) and c ( white portland cement ) with respect to the plug thicknesses ( 2 , 5 and 7 mm ) . a statistically significant difference ( p<0.05 )
was observed between groups a and b as to the leakage in 2- mm - thick plugs , with better results for group a ( table 3 ) .
materials did not show statistically significant difference ( p>0.05 ) when groups with 5-mm - thick plugs were compared to each other ( table 4 ) . regarding the 7-mm - thick plugs , there was statistically significant difference ( p<0.05 ) between groups a and b and between groups b and c , with worst results for group b in both comparisons ( table 5 )
