we can conclude that total facet arthroplasty represents a feasible long - term solution for dynamic stabilization of the lumbar spine after decompression
dynamic stabilization was not a new idea,5,6 but facet arthroplasty was designed to mimic natural movement of the vertebral segments without overstraining the adjacent vertebral disks , which was not possible before.7,8
we performed a prospective observational study on 14 cases operated on in our department between 2005 and 2008 .
the patients were diagnosed with lumbar stenosis due to hypertrophy of the articular facets on one to three levels .
. it also has the potential advantage of preserving normal biomechanics of the lumbar segments , which might reduce the impact of adjacent - disk degeneration .
the preliminary results of the initial 20 patients have been previously presented.911 of the 13 patients available for long - term follow - up , four showed progression of the degeneration , both at the operated level , as well as the proximal segment , with limited range of motion but no clinical deterioration .
this is important , because it allows for immediate recovery without a long period of rest waiting for consolidation , as is the case with fusion . functional scores , together with dynamic radiographic imaging , confirmed the functional efficacy of this new implant ( table 5 , figures 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 ) .
