therefore , the present study was 
 undertaken to investigate and compare the pattern of secretion and the expression of mg2 
 and lactoferrin in individuals with aggressive periodontitis , chronic periodontitis and 
 without periodontitis .
probed with anti - lactoferrin antibodies revealed a difference in 
 banding pattern among groups ( figure 1b ) ; 
 individuals from apg and cpg had an increase in expression upon gustatory 
 stimulation , whereas individuals from cg exhibited a decrease .
apg - aggressive periodontitis group ; cpg - generalized chronic periodontitis 
 group ; cg - control group comparison of expression among groups under non - stimulated conditions revealed that 
 cg exhibited the highest expression of mg2 and lactoferrin ( figures 2a and 2b ) .
nevertheless , 
 this is the first study that compares the expression of salivary proteins among 
 individuals with aggressive and chronic periodontitis at the same time , and that 
 evaluates the influence of stimulation over time in the expression of mg2 and 
 lactoferrin in individuals with periodontitis .
stimulation significantly raised salivary volumes 
 in all groups ( apg - p=0.01 ; cpg - p=0.03 ; cg - p=0.01 ) ; no significant time effect 
 was observed for non - stimulated or stimulated conditions , and the observed flow rates 
 under both conditions did not differ among groups .
