therefore , wat is considered to be one of the tissues that play a critical role in the onset of lifestyle - related diseases , and the reduction of excess wat and the improvement of abnormal adipokine secretion are important strategies for the prevention and improvement of lifestyle - related diseases .
therefore , there is an urgent need to establish strategies for the prevention and improvement of obesity and diabetes .
exercise training ( tr ) not only causes a loss of wat mass , but can also influence the secretory response and expression of adipokines in wat .
furthermore , it may be significantly beneficial to examine the cross - talk between wat and other tissues involving skeletal muscle and to what degree wat contributes to tr - induced changes in blood adipokine levels . because the importance of exercise as a tool for preventing and improving obesity and lifestyle - related diseases can be expected to grow in the future , further research is desirable .
although tr - induced wat reduction is one of the key reasons for attenuation of dysregulated expression of adipokines , detailed studies about not only wat - reducing effects of tr but also other effects , such as antioxidative effects and angiogenic effects , will be necessary to show the usefulness and distinctiveness of tr .
