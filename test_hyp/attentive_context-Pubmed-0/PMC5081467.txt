we present recent studies that have using optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to explore the function of astrocytes and gliotransmitters .
it is well known that they provide structural and metabolic support for neuronal networks , but a growing body of evidence indicates that they also play an active role in modulating neuronal activity .
although accumulating evidence suggests a coupling between various intracellular changes in astrocytes , such as intracellular calcium increase and gliotransmitter release , there is also evidence against this view ; thus , the mechanisms underlying astrocyte - neuronal communication are still debated . in this review ,
gliotransmitters facilitate or inhibit the excitability and synaptic transmission of neighboring neurons , and the outcome of their release is dependent on the site of action and types of activated receptors . through the use of volume - sensitive organic anion channels , gap junction hemichannels , p2x7 , bestrophin-1 , and reverse - orientation plasma membrane glutamate transporters , diverse mechanisms for gliotransmitter release
in addition , the exact molecular mechanisms governing gliotransmitter release from astrocytes remains to be revealed . a combinatorial approach of advanced functional manipulation techniques such as optogenetics and chemogenetics , together with pharmacological and molecular genetic methods , can further our understanding of glial function in health and disease , including neurodevelopment , neurodegenerative disorders , and neuroinflammatory conditions .
