we describe this case with a brief review of the literature with an emphasis on its pathogenesis and treatment .
the authors report a case of dorsal nasal cyst that was presumed to have a different pathogenesis .
only several cases have been reported in the literature and most of them concerned mucous cysts ( 1 - 3 ) .
thirty years earlier at a local clinic , she had undergone augmentation rhinoplasty with a material presumed to be silicone .
the mainstay of treating postrhinoplasty nasal dorsal cyst is complete resection and reconstruction . in this case ,
rarely , a foreign body type cyst resulting from petroleum jelly impregnated with the packing material has been reported .
fortunately , we could augment the depressed dorsum and radix with autogenous septal and auricular cartilages without harvesting the rib cartilage despite the large defect .
careful dissection and meticulous manipulation of tissue and implant are necessary to prevent the mucosa from being grafted with the implant material ( 4 - 6 ) .
although many theories have been suggested for the late cyst formation after rhinoplasty , migration or incorporation of mucosal tissue in the subcutaneous space during the surgical procedure has been accepted as an important mechanism ( 4 - 6 ) .
