the aim of this study was to review the presentation , management , and outcome of this relatively rare disorder at our centre .
this was a retrospective study of os seen at the retina clinic from january 2009 to march 2015 .
a retained iron - containing iofb can manifest itself after several years with clinical and electrophysiological features of os .
best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) at presentation ranged from 1/60 to 6/9 and the most common features of os were cataract and pigmentary retinopathy seen in 6 ( 67% ) and 4 ( 44% ) eyes , respectively . in four of the cases of cataract ,
one patient ( case 6 ) had a history of previous intraocular surgery following trauma to the eye but an iofb was not found then .
a plain radiograph of the orbit was performed in 4 patients and ct scan in 1 patient with an iofb demonstrated in each case .
eyes with a metallic iofb with clinical and/or erg features of os that underwent iofb removal were included in the study .
ocular siderosis ( os ) is a severe sequel of retained iron - containing intraocular foreign body ( iofb ) .
