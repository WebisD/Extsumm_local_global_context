, we describe two cases of cop who developed bilateral anterior uveitis with hypopyon unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy but responsive to systemic corticosteroid therapy . in addition , the clinical condition of their cop was concomitant to that of their intraocular inflammation .
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ( cop ) , also known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia ( boop ) , is a relatively rare disorder with distinctive clinical , imaging and pathological features .
a 65-year - old woman was referred for evaluation of bilateral decreased vision and glaucoma .
further investigation with increased numbers of case studies and statistical analysis may result in the discovery of new symptoms for uveitis and cop .
nongranulomatous presentations are mostly idiopathic or due to hla - b27 antigen involvement   . it is well known that systemic diseases that can be associated with nongranulomatous uveitis include behet 's disease , ankylosing spondylitis , inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis . although the cause is not fully disclosed , certain ocular and systemic conditions might be the underlying association with nongranulomatous uveitis . in this report
patients with cop manifest rapid clinical and imaging improvement with corticosteroid therapy , but suffer from frequent relapses . through histopathological examination and clinical observation , uveitis is usually classified into two categories , granulomatous and nongranulomatous .
