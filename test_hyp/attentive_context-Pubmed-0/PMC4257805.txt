summary of amino acid mutations in spike ( s ) protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) variant ; schematic diagram of the s genes of classical pedv , recent prevalent pedv and the pedv variant ; and alignment of amino acid sequences of the entire s proteins of the pedv variant and reference strains .
our large - scale study of the incidence of pedv in pigs with diarrhea in south korea found that 7.8% of animals were infected with the virus .
moreover , our investigation identified and characterized a new pedv variant with a 612-nt deletion in s gene , corresponding to a 204-aa deletion .
tgev , a highly enteropathogenic porcine coronavirus , is turned into prcv , a respiratory pathogen with reduced pathogenicity , as a consequence of a large deletion in the s gene . unlike prcv
cells and supernatants in every passage were collected separately for rna extraction and used to detect the virus and determine the amount of the viral rna in the medium with real - time rt - pcr ( 8) . the cells and supernatants of the 3 passages were positive for the virus , and the control inoculated with pbs was negative ; however , the amount of viral rna in the medium decreased with each passage . whether the positive result was attributed to residual viruses of the initial inoculation or to the decreased propagation of the virus in the cells
