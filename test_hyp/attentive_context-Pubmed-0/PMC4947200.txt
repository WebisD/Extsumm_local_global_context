an in vitro model was used to assess the morphological parameters , survival rate and development of mouse early stage embryos obtained by nb as consequences of exposure to the cell phone radiation during incubation .
it was also found that emf exposure caused loss of cell viability and changes in membrane permeability and apoptosis .
in conclusion , normal embryonic development up to the blastocysts indicates that emf - exposure commonly did not have major adverse effects on the development of mouse preimplantation embryos , but it could increase the rates of dead cells in blastocysts .
development of preimplantation embryos under exposure to emf ( 9001800 hz ) the p - value between exposed and control samples was calculated using student s t - test for coupled data changes in cleavage rates of embryos after exposure to emf ( 9001800 hz ) .
, there was insignificant change in the rate of embryo survival to the blastocyst stage in the experimental group ( 60.6% ) after exposure to emf emitted from cell phone , compared to controls ( 69.3% ; p=0.1 ) .
for the control and experimental groups , a total of 40 mice ( 20 females and 20 males ) , 6 week old and sexually mature ( balb / c ) , were obtained from animal house of research and clinical center for infertility , yazd , iran .
