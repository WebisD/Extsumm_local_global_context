was significantly associated with age of the study participants ( or = 6.02 , 95% ci : 2.6113.88 ) , educational level ( or = 0.09 , 95% ci : 0.020.49 ) , type of occupation ( or = 4.32 , 95% ci : 1.0617.55 ) , bmi category ( or = 11.72 , 95% ci : 2.3558.43 ) , and number of vegetable servings per day in the bivariate multinomial analysis ( or = 0.3 , 95% ci : 0.110.82 ) .
prehypertension was significantly associated in ghana with income distribution ( or = 1.9 , 95% ci : 1.113.23 ) and bmi category ( or = 2.64 , 95% ci : 1.116.3 ) in the bivariate multinomial analysis when compared with normal blood pressure measurement while in south africa age ( or = 2.66 , 95% ci : 1.345.28 ) and educational level ( or = 0.18 , 95% ci : 0.050.63 ) only had a significant association ( table 2 ) .
the weighted prevalence of hypertension ( both stages 1 and 2 ) was 42.4% in ghana and 46% in south africa .
bmi was an independent predictor for prehypertension in both ghana and south africa which was a similar finding in the study done in the ashanti region of ghana which showed age ( or = 1.56 , 95% ci : 1.122.18 ; p < 0.01 ) , obesity ( or = 2.71 ; 95% ci : 1.405.24 ; p < 0.001 ) , and sex ( or = 2.36 , 95% ci : 1.773.15 ; p < 0.001 ) being independent predictors of prehypertension on multivariable logistic regression .
