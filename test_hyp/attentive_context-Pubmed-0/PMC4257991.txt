, we will discuss the evidence that genetic background plays a role in lifespan extension in response to dietary , genetic and pharmacological interventions in mice .
ageing is associated with a decrease in the quality of life linked to an increase in the risk of developing a range of pathologies , including various dementias , type-2 diabetes , osteoporosis , many cancers and cardiovascular disease . consequently understanding the fundamental processes that drive ageing and
therefore , the use of such interventions in genetically diverse human beings becomes questionable unless we fully understand the precise role that genetic background plays . in this review
increase the susceptibility to develop disease is undoubtedly one of the greatest current challenges in biomedical research . to add to this challenge
furthermore , recent research has suggested that the effectiveness of each intervention on ageing is highly sensitive to the effects of genetic background .
the ageing process is characterised by progressive loss in cellular homeostasis and a decline in physiological function ( balcombe and sinclair , 2001 ) , resulting in an overall decline in fecundity and increased risk of mortality over time .
this has led to renewed hope in identifying realistic , efficacious and safe pharmacological interventions that will increase the period of our life free from age - related diseases ( selman , 2014 ) .
