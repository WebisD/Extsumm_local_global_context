sex has long been a popular topic of research among evolutionary biologists . our personal fascination with the subject is related to the variation that is seen in sexual behavior .
in the quest to identify the genetic basis of behavioral isolation , genomic regions have been mapped for interspecific female receptivity in a variety of species pairs .
first , the stereotypical mating behavior observed in this genus is relatively easy to score   , there are genetic tools available to allow manipulation of the development and physiology of mating behavior , and there is relative ease in housing large numbers of individuals in a uniform environment .
this includes the different roles that make up mating rituals , such as courtship traits or preference for the traits , and the variation of these behaviors observed both within and between species . understanding the biological basis of mating behavior is not only interesting , it is also important for our understanding of evolution as it can shed light on how species boundaries are formed and maintained .
, we can start to understand the biological basis species isolation , and better our understanding on the definition of a species .
