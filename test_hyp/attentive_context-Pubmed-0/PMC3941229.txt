in male group the mean esr before ivig was 34.6  33.5 and after ivig was 49.1  36.2 ; the difference with ( p = 0.003 ) is statistically significant . before receiving ivig the mean esr was 29.4  25.2 in females and after receiving ivig it was 45.6  38.04
the mean of esr before ivig was 31.8  29.04 and after ivig was 47.2  36.9 ; this difference was meaningful ( p = 0.05 ) .
23 ( 46% ) patients were males and 27 ( 54% ) were females ( table 1 ) . the mean and median esr before and after receiving ivig
results of different age groups , 6 patients less than 28 days , 13 patients from 1 month to 1 year , 20 patients from 1 to 6 years old , and 11 patients from 6 to 12 years , have been shown in table 3 .
we try to answer this question too , is esr a valuable apr marker in evaluation of inflammatory response to treatment when ivig is used previously ?
the esr is the most valuable criteria for evaluating and monitoring of response to inflammation ; on the basis of this study on patients who are receiving ivig as a therapy , esr increased falsely ( noninflammatory rising ) ; therefore use of esr for monitoring of response to treatment may not be reliable . based on the knowledge of authors and review of the literature this study seems to be the only work about esr and ivig administration effect in children .
