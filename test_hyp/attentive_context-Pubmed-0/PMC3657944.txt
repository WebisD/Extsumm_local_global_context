incidence of different cadrs incidence of different cadrs with commonly used drugs the lag period between starting the drug and appearance of cutaneous reactions varied between 2 and 14 days in maximum number of cases ( n = 73 , 80.2% ) , within 2 days in 2 ( 2.19% ) and between 15 and 30 days in 16 ( 17.58% ) cases . of all the 91 cases ,
studies have found the incidence of cadrs in developed countries as 13% , while the incidence in developing countries is supposed to be higher between 2 and 5%.  adr reporting leads to an increased general vigilance and may influence the recommendations for drug use through regulatory authorities .
relation of frequency of cadrs with age the drugs most commonly responsible for cadrs were antimicrobials ( 48.30% ) , followed by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) ( 21.90% ) and anti - epileptics ( 13.20% ) [ figure 2 ] .
other drugs presenting with cadrs included ramipril ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , enalapril ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , amlodipine ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , steroids ( n = 2 , 2.19% ) , lithium ( n = 2 , 2.19% ) , oral contraceptives ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , folic acid ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , benzoylperoxide ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , and chlorpromazine ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) . fixed drug combinations causing cutaneous manifestations included tetracycline and ibuprofen ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , diclofenac and allopurinol ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , rifampicin and isoniazid ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) , and dapsone and clofazimine ( n = 1 , 1.09% ) . one fatal cadr , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) , was seen with ciprofloxacin which was prescribed for a case of suspected enteric fever .
