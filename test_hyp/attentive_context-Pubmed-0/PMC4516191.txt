when administered orally , naloxone antagonizes the opioid receptors in the gut wall , while its extensive first - pass hepatic metabolism ensures the lack of antagonist influence on the central - mediated analgesic effect.20 a prolonged - release formulation consisting of oxycodone and naloxone ( pr oxn ) in a 2:1 ratio was developed trying to reduce the incidence of oic maintaining the analgesic effect compared to use of the sole oxycodone.19 in this review , we focus on the specific role of pr oxn in the management of chronic pain and oic in non - cancer patients .
treatment of oic improving adherence at the opioids pain therapy and the quality of life even after a 12-month therapy and in the older patients .
opioids are routinely used in the treatment of moderate - to - severe pain in a wide range of conditions . despite their analgesic efficacy , chronic management with opioids
guidelines for the management of chronic pain recommend opioids for the treatment of moderate - to - severe pain in patients whose pain is not responsive to initial therapies with paracetamol and/or nsaids.8 despite their analgesic efficacy being well recognized , adverse events ( aes ) related to the opioid therapy which include headache , dizziness , fatigue , and especially the opioid - induced bowel dysfunction ( oibd ) can affect daily functioning and patient quality of life.912 opioid - induced constipation ( oic ) , which is part of oibd , occurs in 40% of opioid - treated patients.13 in contrast with the adverse effects mediated through the central opioid receptors , which occur at the start of treatment and usually rapidly disappear , oic is mediated through intestinal opioid receptors and often persists.5,13 laxatives are the most common drugs used to prevent and treat oic .
