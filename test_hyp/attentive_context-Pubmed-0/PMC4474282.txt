we found significantly different patterns of neural responses to fearful and happy faces in unaffected children at familial risk for major depression relative to children without such familial risk . specifically , the at - risk children exhibited hyperactivation of the amygdala and multiple cortical regions to fearful compared to neutral faces , and hypoactivation in multiple cortical regions to happy compared to neutral faces .
the atypical amygdala activations , previously found in adults with major depression , in unaffected at - risk children supports the hypothesis that they may not represent the state of depression but rather represent trait neurobiological underpinnings of risk for major depression in the young , but these group differences extended far beyond the amygdala . while the present findings about altered activations for emotional facial expressions in unaffected children at familial risk for major depression are in noteworthy accord with a prior study ( monk et al . , 2008 )
third , the prior study only examined activations in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens as a priori rois , leaving it unknown as to whether any other brain regions , including the entire neocortex , were functionally different in at - risk children .
