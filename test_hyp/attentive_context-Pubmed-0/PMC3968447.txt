we studied the acute effects of exenatide , a short - acting glp-1 receptor agonist , in individuals with type 1 diabetes with and without residual insulin production .
in patients with long - standing type 1 diabetes , with and without residual insulin production , we observed a marked reduction in glycemic excursion during an mmtt with exenatide pretreatment , but no changes were observed in glucose excursion in response to an intravenous glucose challenge with exenatide pretreatment . in patients with residual insulin production , the insulin secretion was preserved even with reduced glucose levels .
the value of glp-1 receptor agonists in long - term management of type 1 diabetes , particularly those with residual insulin production , will require long - term studies with larger numbers of subjects .
in contrast , we did not detect an effect of exenatide on glucose responses to ivgtt ( without residual insulin production 3,661  133.2 mg / dl ; with residual insulin production 3,686  158.2 mg / dl ; p = 0.8501 ) ( fig .
the total absorption of acetaminophen was reduced , and gastric emptying was delayed with exenatide administration . on average , we did not find an absolute increase in insulin secretion in subjects who were able to secrete insulin , but the relative amount of insulin secreted for the glucose was increased . because we did not find an increase in the absolute amount of insulin that was secreted ,
