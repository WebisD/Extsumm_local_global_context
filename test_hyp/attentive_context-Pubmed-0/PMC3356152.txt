this paper is the among the first to report on using robotic sbrt in patients with real - time motion tracking for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer in patients who are unable to undergo brachytherapy .
these preliminary results suggest that cyberknife robotic sbrt is a safe and effective modality in the treatment of cervix cancer for those patients unable to undergo brachytherapy .
, we present preliminary local control results on the treatment of six patients with cervical cancer who did not have a brachytherapy boost and were treated with an sbrt boost resulting in a total dose of 7785  gy to the cervix .
in addition , for the five patients with a minimum of 12  months follow - up all ( 100% ) remain locally and distantly controlled with no evidence of disease .
this is a retrospective chart review of cervical cancer patients treated with combined external beam radiation and sbrt boost to the cervix at winthrop - university hospital from 3/2009 to 8/2011 .
in addition , the lack of any failure for the five patients with a minimum of 12  months follow - up is highly promising compared to the ebrt boost results for which the cancer - specific overall survival at 1  year was already only 80% ( barraclough
