the present study aimed to investigate the effects of nmes on 
 the facial muscles and oral phase of swallowing in patients with oral phase dysphagia who 
 have cfp following a stroke .
the oral phase vds score statistically significantly 
 decreased from 27.0  5.0 to 22.2  4.3 points ( table

mcs and mls improved following intervention from 14.3  3.4 to 18.4  2.8 kpa and from 10.6 
  2.7 to 13.4  2.7 kpa , respectively .
nine stroke patients with dysphagia ( age , 60.78  4.76  years ; 5 males and 4 females ) were 
 eligible for this study .
nmes : neuromuscular electrical stimulation ; mcs : maximal cheek strength ; mls : maximal 
 lip strength ; vds : videofluoroscopy dysphagia scale ) .
however , most studies have 
 reported applying it on the swallowing - related muscles located on the front side of the neck 
 in patients with pharyngeal dysphagia to examine the effects on swallowing function4 , 5 . 
 therefore , there is insufficient evidence on the effects of nmes on patients with oral phase 
 dysphagia accompanied by cfp .
