outcomes were obtained from the australia and new zealand intensive care society ( anzics ) database . from a pool of 172 australia and new zealand hospitals , the presence or absence of a medical emergency team ( met ) could be determined in 131 , of which 84 ( 64% ) had established an met . of the 84 hospitals with an met , 24 provided adequate data to the anzics database to determine the number and rate of intensive care unit ( icu ) admissions following an in - hospital cardiac arrest , and the proportion of icu readmissions , one year before and one year after implementing the met .
jfb declares an academic bias towards favouring outreach care as an effective method of improving the quality of acute care .
we are left with performing retrospective observational before - and - after studies , relying on large numbers to minimise confounding .
the authors suggest that the introduction of mets has been driven not by evidence of efficacy but by evidence of suboptimal care of acutely ill patients in hospital and an assumption that pre - emptive intensive care would either save lives or permit a dignified death .
