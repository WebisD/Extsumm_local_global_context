our goal was to evaluate clinical response rates among patients treated in the department of oncology at the hospital general san felipe ( hgsf ) , who received either ebrt alone or concurrent chemoradiation ( ccrt ) for locally advanced cervical cancer .
following treatment , those patients with a complete clinical response ( ccr ) undergo extrafascial hysterectomy in lieu of brachytherapy 46  weeks after completion of treatment .
efforts should be made to treat women with locally advanced cervical cancer with cisplatin - based ccrt .
stage iib was the most common stage at diagnosis in both groups with 44/90 ( 49% ) patients in the ebrt group and 38/75 ( 51% ) patients in the ccrt group respectively .
the ccr of 33.3% were significantly lower in both scc and adenocarcinoma patients who received ccrt comparing to the ccr of 76.7% for those who received ebrt ( table 2 ) .
overall 76/135 patients with scc demonstrated 56.3% ccr rate , which was comparable to the ccr of 18/30 ( 60% ) among adenocarcinoma cases .
only 50.7% of patients with tumors measuring >  4  cm had a clinical complete response . with regards to treatment time
