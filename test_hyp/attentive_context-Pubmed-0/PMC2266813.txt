the present study examines joint changes in perfusion and bold 
 signals during monocular and binocular stimulation , to test the hypothesis that 
 spatial decoupling of flow and metabolic responses during stimulation of only a 
 partial subset of the columnar regions distributed within primary visual cortex 
 leads to a significant shift in the ratio between spatially averaged bold and 
 perfusion signals ( measured using arterial spin - labeling ) . by combining 
 quantitative mri - based measures of these two physiological quantities ,
the limited impact of monocular blockade 
 on flow and bold response amplitudes is also demonstrated , and should serve as 
 a caution that ocular dominance contrast is likely to be faint in hemodynamic 
 imaging methods .
we hope 
 to provide new insight into the spatial precision with which cerebral blood 
 flow is regulated , as well as factors which determine bold contrast amplitude 
 in cortical tissues exhibiting columnar organization .
we 
 found that the bold and cbf responses to monocular visual stimulation were both 
 significantly reduced in v1 relative to the responses observed during binocular 
 stimulation ( figure 3 ) .
in this study , we examined the coupling between bold and cbf 
 responses in primary visual cortex during monocular and binocular stimulation .
