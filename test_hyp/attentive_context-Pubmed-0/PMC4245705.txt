we report here a patient with fap , who had total proctocolectomy resection via rectal eversion over the dentate line under direct visualization and ileoanal - j pouch anastomosis by double - stapler technique .
familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by a germ line mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) gene .
total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis ( ira ) and total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch - anal anastomosis ( ipaa ) are procedures of choice without need for permanent stoma .
anorectal eversion may allow the assessment of the mucosa under direct visualization and resection remaining very little rectal mucosa and eases the hand - sewn or stapler - facilitated anastomosis .
a 40-year - old female patient with a family history of colorectal cancer who has multiple adenomatous polyps from 4  cm proximal to the dentate line to the entire colon on colonoscopy was diagnosed as fap .
surgical options for fap patients that avoid the need for a permanent stoma include total colectomy with ira and restorative proctocolectomy with ipaa .
we conclude that , to facilitate accurate fashioning of stapled ipaa , anorectal eversion can be put into practice during restorative proctocolectomy .
