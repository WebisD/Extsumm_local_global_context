the endothelial glycocalyx appears to be a key structure for regulating body sodium . in vitro studies
we look forward to clinical research that will hopefully confirm these results in vivo in humans and substantiate the mechanism behind the protective effect of a low salt diet on the cardiovascular system .
show that the quality of this biopolymer layer is determined by the abundance of its electrical negative charges .
for millions of years , daily salt ( sodium chloride ) intake in man was about 1 g . then recently , about 10,000 years ago , salt intake increased by about ten - fold   because of the practice of using salt as a food preservative .
over the last few millennia , humans got used to the taste of salt and enjoyed the benefits of non - perishable food .
currently , there are far more data on the pathophysiology of aldosterone affecting vascular function than on the  normal  vascular physiology of this steroid hormone [ 21 - 33 ]
however , recent observations suggest that the vascular system may also play an important role in this imbalance .
genetically , humans are well - equipped with mechanisms that retain even tiny amounts of salt , a prerequisite for survival at those times when salt was scarce and intake was low . in keeping with this background ,
