so , we aimed to investigate the effect of dietary intake of minerals in patients with stroke .
intake of iron was 21/5  7/5 mg / day and in healthy men , intake of iron was 14/5  8/5 mg / day , whereas rda is 8 mg / day ; therefore , intake of iron in the case group was significantly higher than the control group ( p < 0/05 ) , but intake of iron in case and control women was not significantly different .
intake of zinc in men with stroke was 17/2  8/5 mg / day and in healthy men was 13/3  7/3 , and rda for zinc was 11 mg / day ; so , intake of zinc in men with stroke was significantly higher than healthy men ( p < 0/05 ) .
( p < 0.05 , p < 0.001 in men and female respectively ) . comparison of mean intake of vitamins and minerals in the study subjects with the recommended dietary allowance ( rda ) are shown in tables 3 and 4 . in male patients ,
in this study , we found that men and women with stroke had a diet higher in sodium , the positive association between the intake of sodium and stroke was independent of the intake of potassium , and this was observed similarly for nonoverweight and overweight persons .
