a major effort of 
 our group has been to develop polyphosphoesters 
 ( ppes ) tailored by manipulation of pendant functional groups on the 
 pentavalent phosphorus atoms and to integrate the ppe system into 
 new classes of degradable , biocompatible polymeric nanomaterials .
particularly , introduction of reactive vinyl ether moieties to degradable , 
 biocompatible ppes and their utilization 
 to conjugate a library of hydroxyl- or thiol - containing biologically 
 active molecules via multiple types of conjugation chemistries are 
 envisioned to expand the breadth of this chemical approach in the 
 development of functional biomaterials . herein , we report the 
 organocatalyzed rop of ethylene glycol vinyl 
 ether - containing cyclic phosphotriester monomer , as an initial fundamental 
 study toward unique degradable , functional polymer materials .
the degradation 
 products , as identified by mass spectrometry , were found to be nontoxic 
 toward two standard cell lines : raw 264.7 mouse macrophages and ovcar-3 
 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells .
after 
 demonstrating the well - controlled homopolymerization of the monomer 
 with predetermined molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions , 
 the resulting vinyl ether - functionalized ppe scaffold was conjugated 
 with hydroxyl- or thiol - containing model small molecules via three 
 different types of conjugation chemistries  thiol  ene 
  click  reaction , acetalization , or thio  acetalization 
 reaction  revealing efficient routes for postpolymerization 
 modifications of functional polymers . furthermore , amphiphilic diblock 
 copolymers containing the ethylene glycol vinyl ether - functionalized 
 ppe as a hydrophobic block segment , also prepared by rop , afforded 
 well - defined micelles that showed a ph - dependent hydrolytic core degradability 
 of both backbone and side chains in aqueous solutions .
