large clusters of prediction locations with a high probability ( i.e. , > 50% ; indicative of low uncertainty ) of prevalence being > 50% intervention threshold were located in a mid - latitudinal band across mali , running from western to central regions , and in the niger river valley region of niger .
the red areas had a low degree of uncertainty that predicted prevalence was > 50% , and the blue areas had a high degree of uncertainty that predicted prevalence was > 50% .
smaller clusters were located in various parts of southern and eastern mali , northwestern and northeastern burkina faso , and south - central niger . predicted probability of prevalence of infection with schistosoma hematobium being > 50% in burkina faso , mali , and niger in boys ages 1316 years ; results are based on a bayesian geostatistical model .
bayesian probability maps were produced for each sex and age group , but for illustrative purposes we present predicted probability of prevalence > 50% in boys ages 1316 years ( the group with the highest infection prevalence ; figure 2 ) .
in addition to providing an evidence base for distributing resources in 3 west african countries as part of the sci - supported national control programs , the maps presented here have a potential role in maintaining sustainability of schistosomiasis control after sci support ends ( sci is funded through 2009 ) . they can be used as advocacy tools for channeling funds to high - risk populations in the affected countries and , in the likely event that money for schistosomiasis control in these countries becomes more limited after sci support ends , they can be used to ensure that scarce governmental resources are distributed as efficiently as possible .
