the major aim of this study was to examine regional absolute eeg delta , theta , and alpha amplitudes in patients with an , and , employing a blind study , to contrast these eeg data with results from a group of comparable healthy controls .
anorexia nervosa ( an ) is a severe disorder strongly associated with the female sex and with a number of neurobiological correlates .
this eeg pattern , with frontal theta and slight alpha and delta changes , may suggest a different average level of arousal ( vigilance ) or attention .
it could also reflect different mental state or trait in the an group compared to the matched control group , possibly related to a frontal lobe dysfunction .
an subjects had significantly increased theta activity at both the left ( f3 ; p=0.014 ) and right ( f4 ; p=0.038 ) frontal electrodes ( figure 1 ) .
there was no difference between the an group patients and controls in age , years of education , full - scale iq , or any of the wais - iii indexes.19 both groups were in the upper intelligence quotient ( iq ) range , as measured by the general ability index22 derived from the wais - iii.19 no epileptiform eeg activity was observed .
