the issva is an organization comprising of specialists in various disciplines interested in vascular anomalies and was founded in 1992 in budapest with the aim of achieving consensus among health care professionals on the terminology , to further the knowledge of pathogenesis , diagnosis and treatment of these vascular lesions .
historically benign vascular tumors were classified : ( 1 ) according to the type of fluid they contained as hemangioma ( blood - containing lesion ) and lymphangioma ( lymph - containing lesion ) and ( 2 ) according to the size of the vascular channels as capillary ( small diameter vascular channels ) and cavernous ( large diameter vascular channels ) .
terms to be avoided when describing these lesions include angioma , birthmarks , capillary hemangioma , cavernous hemangioma , juvenile hemangioma , strawberry hemangioma and inappropriate interchangeable use of the terms hemangioma and vascular malformation .
therapeutic guidelines , management and follow - up of hemangiomas and vascular malformations differ and are beyond the scope of this article .
the classification and the terminologies used for various vascular lesions have been very confusing despite the fact that a biological classification was first published in 1982 by mulliken and glowacki .
