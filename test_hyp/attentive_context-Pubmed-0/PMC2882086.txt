she had previously been diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma in her right breast and had known metastases to the liver and bone .
a localized metastasis to the abducens nucleus that spares the mlf can cause gaze palsy in a patient with breast cancer .
the findings in our patient suggested impairment of the right abducens nucleus , which contains both motoneurons that control right eye abduction and internuclear neurons that control left eye adduction .
infection or pontine hemorrhage has been reported , this is the first report of unilateral horizontal gaze palsy due to metastasis to the abducens nucleus . in conclusion ,
follow - up brain mri revealed an enhancing round nodular mass at the right facial colliculus of the lower pons , suggesting involvement of either the right abducens nucleus or the paramedian pontine reticular formation ( pprf ) along with the facial nucleus or nerve tract ( fig .
neoplasm is known to be one of the causes of abducens nerve palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia . however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of unilateral conjugate gaze palsy due to a pontine metastatic mass . while gaze palsy caused by herpes zoster
