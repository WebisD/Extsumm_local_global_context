the purpose of this study was to identify the potential benefits of early surgery in elderly hip fracture patients at multiple centers in korea by evaluating the effect of timing of surgery on mortality .
mortality hazard ratio of the 712 patients who did not receive surgery within 3 days after the fracture injury increased in relation to the elapsed time with an unadjusted mortality rate of 1.2 ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] : 0.8 - 1.2 ) in patients who had surgery within 3 to 7 days after the injury and 1.6 ( 95% ci : 1.1 - 2.1 ) in patients who had surgery at least 7 days after admission .
1388 consecutive patients older than 65 years , admitted to three urban teaching hospitals with a diagnosis of traumatic hip fracture between january 2002 and december 2009 constituted this retrospective study .
we recommend concentrating more on optimizing the condition of patients early with sufficient medical treatment rather than being bound by the absolute timing of surgery .
in addition , the results of this study show that the time to surgery did not have a significant effect on short term or long term mortality and complications , probably because the major reason for the delay of surgery was an active medical problem.810202122232425 in this study , the rate of poor physical status was high in the delayed - surgery group , which may account for the high mortality and complication rate in this group . however , in elderly patients , 1 week of bed rest resulted in muscle weakness and a 1/3 decrease in strength , and it increased the rate of complications such as pulmonary embolism .
