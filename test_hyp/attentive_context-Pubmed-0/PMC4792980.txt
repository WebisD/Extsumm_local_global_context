the ability of nmes to stimulate the deep lumbar stabilizing muscles of ldk 
 patients was investigated , using real - time ultrasound imaging ( rusi ) .
, our results show the protocols b and a+b 
 maximally stimulated the superficial and deep lm muscles , and that protocols a and a+b 
 maximally stimulated the abdominal ( tra , oi and oe ) muscles .

 muscle * significantly increased compared to the resting state , p < 0.05 increases in the thicknesses of the superficial and deep lms during protocol b and a+b were 
 significantly larger than during protocol a ( p < 0.05 ) , but no significant difference was 
 found between protocols b and a+b .
clinical studies , such as , 
 gait analysis , are required to assess dynamic sagittal imbalance improvements before , during 
 and after nmes of deep lumbar stabilizing muscles of patients with ldk . in conclusion ,
increases in the thicknesses of oe , oi , and tra were 
 significantly greater during protocols a and a+b than during b protocol ( p < 0.05 ) , but 
 no significant difference was found between protocols a and a+b ( table 2table 2.thickness ( mm ) changes from rest induced by nmesmusclenmes protocolstimulation effecta ( a)b ( b)a+b ( c)pabpacpbcsm0.5 ( 1.1)1.2 ( 1.0)1.3 ( 1.1)0.0340.0360.499dm0.3 ( 0.8)1.0 ( 0.9)1.1 ( 1.3)0.0380.0280.494oe2.1 ( 1.7)0.1 ( 0.8)1.9 ( 1.9)0.0020.4690.005oi1.3 ( 1.1)0.2 ( 0.4)1.0 ( 1.2)0.0000.2970.002tra0.7 ( 0.7)0.7 ( 0.7)0.6 ( 0.7)0.0180.4750.034values are means (  standard deviations ) . nmes : neuromuscular electrical stimulation . a : stimulation of abdominal muscles , b : stimulation of lumbar muscles , a+b :
