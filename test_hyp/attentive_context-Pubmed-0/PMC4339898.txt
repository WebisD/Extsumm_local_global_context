aorto - esophageal fistula is a rare , but life - threatening condition presenting as ugib .
upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( ugib ) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity accounting for about 56.5/100,000 hospitalization with a mortality rate of 8.2% .
aorto - esophageal fistula ( aef ) , an abnormal anatomical communication between the aorta and esophagus is a rare cause of ugib .
a 70-year - old male patient with hypertension with regular ethanol use , presented to a local hospital with complaints of hematemesis and melena from the past 1-day .

aorto - esophageal fistula is an abnormal anatomical communication between the aorta and esophagus . in 1818
a high level of suspicion is needed , as routine tests performed for ugib typically only detect one - third of cases . avoiding over - resuscitation can be helpful in preventing subsequent hemorrhages .
