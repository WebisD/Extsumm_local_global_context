a key factor is the local ischemia , which leads to a lowered ph and a subsequent release of several inflammatory mediators in muscle tissue .
in spite of a lack of well - designed studies , the best available evidence supports that trps develop after muscle overuse .
myofascial pain syndrome ( mps ) is described as the sensory , motor , and autonomic symptoms caused by myofascial trigger points ( trps ) .
ragged red ( rr ) fibers and increased numbers of cytochrome - c - oxidase ( cox ) negative fibers are common in patients with myalgia , which are suggestive of an impaired oxidative metabolism .
although muscle damage is not required for the development of trp , there may be a disruption of the cell membrane , damage to the sarcoplasmic reticulum with a subsequent release of high amounts of calcium - ions , and disruption of cytoskeletal proteins , such as desmin , titin , and dystrophin .
several potential mechanisms may play a role , such as eccentric overload , submaximal sustained , and ( sub)-maximal concentric contractions .
there is general agreement that any kind of muscle overuse or direct trauma to the muscle can lead to the development of trps .
