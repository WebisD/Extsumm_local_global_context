in summary , our study shows that lung cancer as an incidental finding is not uncommon even amongst nonsmokers and that the better survival of patients with asymptomatic nsclc is related to the greater number of patients with earlier - stage disease .
the objective of this study was to analyze the clinical records of lung cancer patients who underwent surgical resection to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with incidentally detected lung cancer and patients with symptomatic lung cancer .
0.001 ) was higher in this group , without differences in clinical suspicion of n2 ( 8.8 versus 12.9% , p = 0.146 ) .
the overall 5-year survival rates were higher for asx patients : 66.2% and 46.0% for asx and symptomatic patients , respectively ( p = 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) . amongst the stage
i patients , the 5-year survival rates were 81.2% in asx patients and 58.6% in sx patients ( p = 0.014 ) ( figure 2 ) . when only stage ia was considered , 5-year survival rates were not different ( 71.2 versus 84.1% , p = 0.191 ) ( figure 3 ) . when analysis was restricted to t1a tumors
