in addition , of all the other established type 2 diabetes loci to date , we do not observe a convincing role for them in the determination of birth weight .
in our initial analysis , 12 snps corresponding to the 9 type 2 diabetes loci previously studied in the context of birth weight were investigated in our cohort , namely , tcf7l2 , hhex - ide , pparg , kcnj11 , slc30a8 , igf2bp2 , cdkal1 , cdkn2a/2b , and jazf1 ( 4,6 ) ( table 1 ) .
we observed strong association with rs7756992 ( p = 8 10 ) at the cdkal1 locus with low birth weight ; this snp yielded strongest association to type 2 diabetes in an icelandic gwa study carried out on the illumina humanhap500 platform ( 21 ) .
snps rs10946398 or rs7754840 at the same locus have been reported to be most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes from gwa studies on the affymetrix platform or the illumina humanhap300 beadchip ( 16,18,19 ) ; however , using a perfect surrogate , rs4712523 ( r = 1 ) , we only observed nominally significant association ( p = 0.01 ) .
from this interim analysis of our ongoing gwa study of birth weight in a european american cohort , it is clear that the cdkal1 locus , which was uncovered in gwa analyses of type 2 diabetes , is strongly associated with birth weight in our study population .
