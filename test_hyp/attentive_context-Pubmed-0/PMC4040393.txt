the evolutionarily conserved fibrillar selector gene salm from drosophila , mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of not only sarcomeric components but also genes dictating the physiologic status of the muscle , in addition to pervasive regulation of alternative splicing , are likely relevant to the underpinnings of cardiomyopathy in humans .
muscle fiber - type specification is a complex process controlled by coordinated regulation of both transcription and alternative splicing .
research in model organisms such as flies provides an important complement to vertebrate studies in understanding the basic principles contributing to the development of different muscle - types . in the case of
we focus on mammalian skeletal muscle and drosophila body muscle as the best understood model systems .
each fiber houses many highly ordered myofibrils that are laterally aligned to form stereotypical cross - striations . in this review , we discuss recent progress on mechanisms of differential transcription and alternative splicing that instruct functional differences between muscle types .
one important challenge is to generate a complete network of both transcriptional and splicing regulators expressed in different muscle types , as factor cooperativity and feed - forward or feed - back mechanisms are important in fine - tuning muscle fiber - type specific physiological properties .
