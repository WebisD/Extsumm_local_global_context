osc - abi was related to dop - abi ( r = 0.53 , p < 0.0001 ) in the total population , as well as in nondiabetic patients and in diabetic patients ( fig .
this may be a low - cost and effective procedure to improve pad management in at - risk patients , including subjects with diabetes , with early recognition and appropriate counseling for the control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors .
dop - abi was measurable in 98% of the total population studied ( 97% of diabetic and 99.2% of nondiabetic patients ) , whereas osc - abi was obtained in 95.5% of the legs in the whole population ( p = 0.16 for comparison of techniques ) , in 95.8% of diabetic patients , and in 95.3% of nondiabetic patients .
a total of 146 consecutive patients ( 292 lower limbs ) , referred to the physiology department for doppler ultrasound evaluation of pad , were prospectively included in the study .
doppler ultrasound examination showed at least one arterial stenosis in 41.7% of the legs in diabetic patients and in 50.8% of the legs in nondiabetic patients . a proximal localization ( i.e. , iliac or femoral artery ) was more frequent in nondiabetic than in diabetic patients ( 37.7 and 5.2% of the localizations , respectively , p < 0.0001 ) , who had more distal localization ( 72.0 vs. 20.8% of the localizations in nondiabetic patients , p = 0.0004 ) .
