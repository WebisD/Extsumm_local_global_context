, we aimed to highlight the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral fat embolism through an illustrative a case developing change of consciousness , respiratory failure and epileptic seizures after long - bone fracture caused by gunshot injury .
fat embolism syndrome ( fes ) is a rare and potentially lethal complication of long bone fractures .
cerebral fat embolism is extremely rare but it should be suspected in trauma patients with long - bone fractures accompanied by unexplained neurological or respiratory deterioration .
a 20-year - old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with sudden change in consciousness and muscle contractions after 1 day follow - up in a hospital for long bone fractures of femur and tibia due to gun - shot injury . on admission ,
fat emboli can pass through the pulmonary vasculature , resulting in systemic embolization , most commonly in the brain and kidneys . in this article
fes was first described in 1862 after an autopsy identified fat in the pulmonary vasculature following a crush injury .
the outcome of patients with fes who receive supportive care is generally complete resolution of pulmonary , neurological , and dermatological lesions with a mortality of less than 10% .
