acute dorsolateral striatum slices were prepared from p58p87 hemizygous bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) d2 dopamine receptor - egfp ( d2-egfp ) or d1 dopamine receptor - tdtomato ( d1-tdtomato ) mice , males and females in the c57bl/6 background . in accordance with northwestern university animal studies committee ,
indirect pathway spns in these mice were identified by the lack of fluorescence in the soma , possessing spines ( visualized with the aid of an alexa fluor hydrazide fluorescent dye ) , and passive membrane properties of spns . in bac d2-egfp mice ,
dual simultaneous somatic whole - cell recordings were made with borosilicate patch pipettes having open tip resistances of 34.5 mohms .
direct pathway spns in these mice were identified by the lack of fluorescence , possessing spines ( visualized with the aid of an alexa fluor hydrazide fluorescent dye ) , and passive membrane properties of spns .
spns restricted to the dorsolateral striatum were identified using infrared differential interference contrast on an upright olympus microscope and a cooled ccd camera ( coolsnap hq ) controlled with metamorph software . in bac d1-tdtomato mice ,
to minimize diffusion , over the course of 1 minute the following volumes were slowly injected : 0.2 l of a recombinant rabies virus carrying a channelrhodopsin-2-venus expression construct ( rrabies - chr2-vn ) for pons , 0.1 l rrabies - chr2-vn for striatum , and 0.1 l of an adeno - associated virus carrying a chr2-venus expression construct ( aav2/9-chr2-vn , supplied by u. penn vector core ; addgene 20071 ) for motor cortex .
