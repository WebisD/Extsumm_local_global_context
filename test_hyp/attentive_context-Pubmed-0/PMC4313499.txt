a 37-year - old man of english descent presented with long - standing photophobia , reduced vision , and retinal pigmentary changes .
danon retinopathy is a rare x - linked disorder related to mutations in the lamp2 gene .
is intravitreal bevacizumab , which this patient refused . in conclusion , to our knowledge our patient is the first reported case of danon retinopathy with cme .
we recommend consideration be given to carbonic anhydrase inhibition for patients with cme associated with danon retinopathy , given the response seen in other retinal conditions with associated cme and macular cysts with this treatment . a further treatment option to consider for similar patients
lack of effect of cai is in contrast to previous studies which have demonstrated a beneficial effect of cais in patients with retinal dystrophy and cme such as retinitis pigmentosa , and patients with macular cysts , including x - linked retinoschisis and enhanced s - cone syndrome , although some patients fail this treatment . despite lack of response in our patient ,
these demonstrate the peppered pigmentary mottling and cystic - appearing lesions within the macula with photoreceptor loss and minimal response to treatment retinal thickness and visual function in response to treatment treatment with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ( cai ) dorzolamide 2% topically bd to both eyes was initiated . following
