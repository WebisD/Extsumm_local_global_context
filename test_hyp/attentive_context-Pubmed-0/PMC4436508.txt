we report a case with ohtahara syndrome that showed remarkable and sustained response for close to one year post - initiation of ketogenic diet .
ohtahara syndrome is a devastating infantile epileptic encephalopathy , which has an onset within the first few weeks of life , is associated with predominantly tonic seizures , and shows suppression - burst background on eeg .
our patient is a five - year - old child , full term product of a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery .
however , its efficacy in ohtahara syndrome has rarely been reported , and to the best of our knowledge , there is only one isolated case report .
ohtahara syndrome is one form of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with medically intractable seizures and progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration .
as analyzed all patient data and was a major contributor in writing the manuscript . in was involved with checking the accuracy of the ketogenic diet regimen .
it is one of the epileptic encephalopathies that are characterized by frequent and medically intractable seizures , along with a significant burden of interictal epileptiform activity , which may contribute to a progressive and often catastrophic neurodevelopmental outcome .
, there is an isolated case report describing the persistence of suppression - burst pattern in a five - year - old girl with ohtahara syndrome   and one reported case of an infant with ohtahara syndrome who responded to ketogenic diet , but the degree and duration of response is not known .
