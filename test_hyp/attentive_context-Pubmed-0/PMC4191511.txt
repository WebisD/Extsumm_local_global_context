the association of volume and mortality rates is particularly important for the aged , because the relative frailty of this population and the frequent presence of co - morbidity may make the aged more sensitive to the effects of surgical experience .
lastly , more favorable outcomes were experienced by patients in the west for five out of the eight procedures studied . because death within 60 days of surgery is the mortality measure used in this study , rather than inhospital deaths , this finding is not a function of the fact that length of stay tends to be shorter in the west .
, the magnitude of the regression coefficients is much greater for the model using inhospital deaths , and the p - values are considerably lower ; both facts indicate a stronger volume - mortality relationship for inhospital mortality than mortality within 60 days of surgery . for coronary artery bypass and resection of the intestine ,
patients undergoing turp , hip arthroplasty ( other ) , and femur fracture reduction in the west exhibit significantly better outcomes than patients undergoing the same procedures in most or all of the other three regions ( p < .05 for the regional dummy variables ) .
