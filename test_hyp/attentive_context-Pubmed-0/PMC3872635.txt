we have presented a rare case of a large ameloblastic carcinoma in a 44-year - old female , which involved a large considerable part of the mandible crossing the midline making this case unusual , which was treated by radical surgery and immediate jaw reconstruction .
in 1983 , shafer introduced the term ameloblastic carcinoma to describe ameloblastomas in which there had been histologic malignant transformation .
the treatment of and prognosis for ameloblastic carcinoma is unclear in the literature due to the rarity of this tumor and the lack of well - documented patients . surgical excision , with or without adjuvant radiotherapy , seems to be required for local control .
it has been suggested that the high rate of recurrence is due to its mode of growth and surgical mismanagement rather that any inherent malignant properties and metastases are  exceedingly rare . 
the clinical and biological differences between conventional ameloblastoma and ameloblastic carcinoma are significant and can be useful to distinguish between the two entities when the pathological diagnosis is not certain .
a 44-year - old female patient presented to the outpatient department with a chief complaint of swelling in the lower jaw since 6 months .
