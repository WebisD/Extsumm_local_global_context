the results presented here show that myo6 and its associated proteins dab2 , ap-2 , and gipc
, thp-1 macrophages were used to evaluate the effects of ldl and oxldl on the expression of mrna and protein for myo6 , dab2 , ap-2 , and gipc1 , as well as the effects of inhibition of myo6 and dab2 expression by small interfering rna ( sirna ) on the uptake of the lipoproteins by the cells .
in addition , myo6 mrna   and low levels of gipc1 mrna   or protein   have been found in human peripheral blood leukocytes . nonetheless , this is the first report of the expression of these proteins in human macrophages , except for one study showing myo6 mrna expression in thp-1 cells .   as positive controls , we demonstrated splice variant expression of myo6 in cos-7 cells , previously shown to express myo6 with and without the li and si insert sequences .
expression of myo6 ( including splice variants ) , dab2 , ap-22 ( one of the large subunits of the ap-2 heterotetrameric complex ) , and gipc1 was demonstrated in both thp-1 macrophages and primary human monocyte - derived macrophages ( hmdm ) , and their subcellular location and interactions within the cells were investigated . to study the possible role of these proteins in macrophage endocytosis
