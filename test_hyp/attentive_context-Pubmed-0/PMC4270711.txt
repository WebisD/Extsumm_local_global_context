jude toronto stentless porcine aortic valve in the united states , which enabled this 59-year - old patient with a history of bacterial endocarditis and aortic regurgitation to avoid heart transplant with complete resolution of his severe left ventricular dysfunction .
the first percutaneous valve - in - valve procedure using the corevalve revalving system for aortic regurgitation in a sorin mitroflow aortic bioprosthesis was reported in 2007 in germany . since then , other case reports of valve - in - valve procedures to treat a failing aortic valve bioprosthesis have been described , but very few in stentless bioprostheses .
while transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( tavr ) volume has grown substantially worldwide in recent years , our collective experience with transcatheter valve - in - valve placement remains relatively low .
successful completion of this procedure supports the idea that stentless valve - in - valve tavr can be a feasible alternative to redo aortic valve surgery in a high- risk patient , if the technical aspects of the procedure can be overcome . in this
we report the first transcatheter corevalve valve - in - valve implantation in a stentless porcine aortic valve in the united states for severe aortic regurgitation .
