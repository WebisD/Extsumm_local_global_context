according to ministry of health data , between 1989 and 1999 , the incidence of imd varied between 1 and 35 cases per 100  000 and the mortality rate varied between 0.71 and 2.62 per million cases .
invasive meningococcal disease ( imd ) is due to infection with the gram - negative bacterium neisseria meningitidis ( n. meningitidis ) .
conjugate vaccines are preferred over polysaccharide vaccines due to their potential for herd protection , immunologic memory and their increased immunogenicity , particularly in children < 2 y of age .
the tsi reports that meningococcal infections were responsible for 10.2% ( 1336 ) of all deaths in children under 5 y of age in year 2008 .
this study reports that n. meningitidis was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children aged < 1 y ( 56.5% ) followed by those aged 14 y. among the samples that were positive for n. meningitidis following pcr analysis , serogroup w-135 was the cause of most infections59 ( 42.7% ) cases were due to serogroup w-135 , 43 ( 31.1% ) were due to serogroup b , 3 ( 2.2% ) were due to serogroup y , and 1 ( 0.7% ) was due to serogroup a. there were no cases with a positive result for serogroup c. in this study , serogroup w-135 was also more common in children aged 416 y , while serogroup b was slightly more common in children aged <3 y. n. meningitidis serogroup w-135 was more prominent than the other meningococcal serogroups in the southeast anatolia while n. meningitidis serogroup b was much more common in the marmara ( northwestern turkey ) and the central region . during ongoing surveillance by ceyhan et al . between 20072009 , while the overall imd incidence was stable , the prevalence of imd due to serogroup b was reported to increase to 35% and the prevalence of serogroup w-135 decreased .
