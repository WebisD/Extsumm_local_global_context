we conclude that cse using sufentanil and fentanyl achieved high patient satisfaction and excellent labour analgesia without serious maternal or neonatal side - effects .
hence , we decided to compare the efficacy , quality and duration of analgesia and maternal and foetal effects of adding the two highly lipid - soluble opioids , sufentanil and fentanyl to low - concentration bupivacaine for cse labour analgesia .
the mean duration of intrathecal analgesia was 109.7 ( 6.3 ) min for group s and 73.63 ( 15.76 ) min for group f. the mean time of onset of epidural analgesia was 2.48 ( 0.28 ) min and 2.55 ( 0.77 ) min for group s and group f , respectively .
onset and duration of analgesia the pain scores during the first and second stages of labour were comparable without any significant difference between the groups using vas scores ( vas : 0 = no pain , 10 = worst pain experienced ) ; 93.3% and 90.0% women had vas scores less than 1 , indicating excellent pain relief by the cse technique in both groups [ table 4 ] .
however , automated regular bolus delivery of epidural analgesia when compared with continuous infusion is found to decrease the incidence of breakthrough pain and increased maternal satisfaction . because of logistic constraints , we used intermittent epidural dosing on demand by the parturients , which , we found , could be comparable to continuous and automated delivery system . the limitation in our study was to combine primiparous and multiparous parturients , which could have altered the results of mode of delivery .
