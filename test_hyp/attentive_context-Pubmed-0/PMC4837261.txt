furthermore , we could avoid previous or concomitant septoplasty in some cases like mild and moderate sd because the success rate was similar to nonseptal deviation group .
we designed the present study in order to investigate the influence of nasal septal deviation on the surgery of lacrimal pathways .
from january 1 , 2008 , until december 31 , 2010 , one hundred and twenty - four patients were considered candidates for tcl dcr surgery , so they were included in this study .
when a septal deviation ( sd ) is present during the endoscopy performed before a transcanalicular diode laser - assisted dacryocystorhinostomy ( tcl dcr ) , one tends to think that this anatomical alteration could influence the final result , due to technical difficulties and alterations in osteotomy healing .
26 lp had a successful postoperative outcome ( 66.7% ) . according to the logit method , the difference between both groups in postoperative outcome was not significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
if we compare the success rate of the sd group ( 66.7% ) and other anatomical alterations ( 44.1% ) in our study , the difference is statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
