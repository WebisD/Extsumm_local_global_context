deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) remains an underestimated problem in icu patients , despite the findings of many randomized controlled trials performed in the field of dvt prophylaxis after surgery during the past few decades .
it strongly suggests that studies dedicated to dvt prophylaxis in icu patients should be performed in order to develop useful recommendations .
the canadian survey reported in the present issue of critical care   provides a useful snapshot of daily clinical practice in canada with regard to dvt prophylaxis .
furthermore , a great effort would have to be made to educate physicians regarding both dvt screening and pharmacological aspects .
thrombotic complications ( dvt , pulmonary emboli ) are a major concern in icu patients and still occur in a significant number of patients .
clinicians should be aware that dvt in icu patients has unusual characteristics that make its clinical diagnosis difficult .
, in which the clinical signs of dvt ( e.g. oedema , pain and flushing ) occurred in less than 1.5% of patients . as a result , physicians are often lulled into an inappropriate sense of security . moreover , the diagnosis is not always easy to confirm .
