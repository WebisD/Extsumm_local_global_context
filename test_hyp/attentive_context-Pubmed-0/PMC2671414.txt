the distinction between severe dengue and severe malaria must be made in an emergency department or hospital setting because in both situations , early diagnosis is essential for patient care .
although acute concurrent infections were benign in our study , special attention should be given to the possibility of co - infection with malaria and dengue , especially when p. falciparum is implicated .
we carried out a retrospective study by testing blood and serum samples on 1,740 patients who consulted the emergency department of cayenne hospital seeking treatment for fever compatible with malaria and/or dengue during a 1-year period , july 2004june 2005 ( figure ) .
concurrent dengue ( edc and ldc ) and malaria were confirmed in 17 of the 1,723 patients ( 1% ) , corresponding to 7.1% ( 17/238 ) of dengue cases and 4.1% ( 16/393 ) of malaria cases , respectively ( table ) .
carriage was considered for classes 1 and 2 ( in the absence of prior antimalarial treatment and for case - patients residing > 1 year in an area of malaria transmission ) . virus isolation or reverse transcription 
diagnosis of malaria has always been quick ; dengue diagnosis was initially conducted only in malaria - negative patients . in our study ,
