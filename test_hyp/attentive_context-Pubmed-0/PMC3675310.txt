stent thrombosis is a rare but fatal complication of drug eluting stent ( des ) .
therefore , new antiplatelet agents have been developed recently and are reported to have better outcomes.3 ) we report a case of recurrent des thrombosis with clopidogrel resistance successfully rescued by prasugrel .
after the change of antiplatelet into prasugrel , clopidogrel resistance was successfully rescued and no thrombotic event has been observed until now . in conclusion , for the prevention of recurrent des thrombosis , dual antiplatelet with aspirin and prasugrel could be one of the potential options in patients with clopidogrel resistance .
a 58-year - old non - smoker male who had no specific medical history visited the emergency room with typical angina on april 2006 .
although dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel significantly reduced the occurrence of stent thrombosis , late stent thrombosis still occurs ; many other factors could be attributable to the occurrence.1)2 ) of these , clopidogrel resistance is regarded as one of the main reasons for the occurrence of des thrombosis .
although dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is the standard medication in patients with des implantation , the unmet needs still exist and fatal complication occurs . particularly , clopidogrel resistance , regarded as one of the major factors for stent thrombosis , has been reported to occur in 30 - 40% of patients.4 - 7 ) to overcome clopidogrel resistance , a dose - up of clopidogrel or triple antiplatelet therapy with cilostazol has been recommended .
