angioleiomyomas of the orbit are rare tumors with good prognosis , and the treatment of choice remains complete surgical excision .
a 22-year - old - male patient presented with a painless swelling over the left eye along with mechanical ptosis of the upper lid .
described an angiomyofibroma of the orbit as a hybrid tumor exhibiting characteristics of a vascular leiomyoma and cavernous hemangioma .
a working diagnosis of a pleomorphic adenoma of the lacrimal gland was made , and an excision biopsy was performed .
since there were no dilated cavernous spaces within our tumor , we consider our case to be a solid variant .
in contrast to his comments , our case was a solid variant which was painless .
the lack of the cavernous venous channels , the unusual location , and absence of the classical purplish hue rule out cavernous hemangioma and angiofibroma in our case .
preoperative magnetic resonance imaging may provide some clues : magnetic resonance findings of peripheral angioleiomyomas were relatively nonspecific , but t2-weighted images show a mass with mixed areas that are both hyper- and iso - intense relative to the skeletal muscle and a hypointense rim .
jakobiec has also described in detail the characteristics of a complex orbital angiomyoma , which had features of a lymphangiohemangioma .
