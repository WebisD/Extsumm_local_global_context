allopurinol has been used as a first - line drug for the treatment of hyperuricemia.3 adverse reactions such as hepatic disorder , hypersensitivity vasculitis , and bone marrow depression have been reported.48 moreover , the dose of allopurinol requires reduction according to the degree of renal impairment.9,10 febuxostat is a nonpurine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase that forms a very stable interaction with both the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme.11 becker et al reported superior efficacy of febuxostat compared with that of allopurinol in diabetic gout patients.12 however , the efficacy of febuxostat was not superior to that of allopurinol in the febuxostat versus allopurinol controlled trial,6 and there was no significant difference between the two drugs with respect to the rate of adverse events ( aes).6,13,14 febuxostat has been shown to be efficacious in elderly patients;13 however , the efficacy and safety of febuxostat in elderly female patients with hyperuricemia remain unclear . to promote proper use of febuxostat
maintenance of low serum urate ( sua ) levels is important for the management of gout.1 achieving the recommended sua levels of less than 6.0 mg / dl2,3 is difficult in elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) patients with renal impairment .
