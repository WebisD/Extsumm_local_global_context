, an attempt has been made to evaluate and compare the efficacy of gel containing chlorhexidine digluconate ( 0.5% ) and chlorhexidine dichydrochloride ( 1.0% ) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing with scaling and root planing alone .
observed significant reduction of gi score with scaling and root planing with chx treated sites when compared with the control ( scaling and root planing ) site , which is similar to the observation of the present study .
it can be concluded that experimental local drug delivery system containing 1.5% chx gel can be effectively used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing and is more effective than scaling and root planing alone in the treatment of periodontal pockets .
comparison of mean relative clinical attachment level table 3 shows a comparison of mean gi scores between test and control group at baseline , 6 weeks , 3 months and 6 months with statistically significant results at 6 weeks and 6 months for the test group ( i.e. , p = 0.039 and p = 0.026 , respectively ) .
table 1 shows a comparison of mean pd between test and control group at baseline , 6 weeks , 3 months and 6 months with statistically significant results at 3 months and 6 months ( i.e. , 0.002 and p = 0.002 respectively ) for the test group .
