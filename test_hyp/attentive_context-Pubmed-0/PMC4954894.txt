we present a patient with sdavf and a history of paraparesis during spinal angiography who was treated successfully using stereotactic radiosurgery ( srs ) using novalis system .
the spinal dural arteriovenous fistula ( sdavf ) is the most common type of spinal vascular malformation , but it is rare condition in overall incidence561013171820 ) .
advanced imaging studies , including the three - dimensional sagittal tricks sequence , may be useful for obtaining information about sdavf and in performing srs and follow - up after srs when selective spinal angiography has failed .
our study has the obvious limitation of only including one treatment case , so additional cases of sdavf treated by srs are necessary to determine if it is an effective treatment for this condition .
sdavf can be treated by surgical interruption and endovascular embolization . to help ensure successful treatment ,
a 43-year - old man presented with slow progression of back pain , voiding difficulty , and boring pain on both lower extremities during 5 months .
sdavf represent a rare pathological condition , but they account for 6080% of all spinal vascular malformation61317182023 ) .
the fistulas of sdavf are located intradurally at the sleeve of the nerve root , and the obliteration of fistulas is the treatment goal for sdavf513182223 ) .
