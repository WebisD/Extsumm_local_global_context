we report a case of an insulinoma in an 11-year - old child who subsequently developed multifocal nodular lesions of the liver after resections of the insulinoma .
hepatic nodular lesions were identified as fnh by needle biopsy , but the association of an insulinoma with the fnh after surgery remains unclear . to our knowledge , this is the first pediatric case report of an insulinoma in which diagnosis was confused due to newly discovered hepatic lesions after tumor resection .
insulinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas , accounting for 2% of all pancreatic tumors .
children account for only 7% of cases of this tumor , and fnh comprises only 2% of all pediatric liver tumors5,6 ) .
focal nodular hyperplasia ( fnh ) represents a localized liver cell hyperplasia containing central and/or stellate fibrous scar4 ) .
an 11-year - old girl was admitted for evaluation of recurrent seizures that had begun 5 months before admittance , especially in the morning , despite administration of oral antiepileptic medication .
malignant insulinoma is extremely rare in the pediatric population , with only a few cases reported in the english literature .
us - guided needle biopsy of the liver yielded a diagnosis of the lesions as fnh , with no necrosis or mitotic activity was noted . since then
