the pathway by which lps activates host innate immune defenses has been illuminated by the positional cloning of lps and establishment of its identity with tlr4 , a mammalian representative of an ancient family of receptors   that serve both developmental and defensive functions .
the function of tlr4 as the lps signal transducer became clear when mapping   and sequencing   data revealed tlr4 as the only gene in a critical 2.6 megabase ( mb ) region and , furthermore , showed that two strains of lps - resistant mice are homozygous for mutations of tlr4 that are absent in closely related lps - sensitive strains . in drosophila ,
moreover , information on the degree of tlr4 polymorphism in these and other species might allow inferences about the importance of different tlr4 domains . accordingly , we decided to sequence the entire tlr4 gene of both humans and mice , and to survey genetic variation at the locus in each species .
, the primary structure of a tlr4 molecule determines ligand specificity , accounting for the well - known observation that mouse cells can recognize tetra - acyl lipid a as an agonist   whereas human cells recognize it as an antagonist . as mice of the c3h / hej strain
