medical mimics software , combined with 3-d laser printing technique , was used in manufacturing individualized thoracic pedicle screw guide plates , which could assist in accurate insertions .
thoracic pedicle screw placement guide plates can be produced by 3-d printing . with high accuracy in placement and convenient operation , it provides a new method for accurate placement of thoracic pedicle screws .
the dissection showed that the 50 screws were all in pedicles and vertebral bodies , with proper length and angles ( figure 7 ) .
after placement of screws , the positional relation between the screw and the neighboring structures , such as vertebral body and spinal canal ( figure 6 ) , were first directly observed , then all the samples for examination were dissected to assess the positional relationship between the screw and the neighboring structures ( figure 7 ) .
post - operative direct observation showed a good positional relationship between screws and neighboring structures , such as vertebral bodies and vertebral canals , and no bony cortex was penetrated ( figure 6 ) .
this article was based on , and made some improvements of , lu s method , which applied 3-d printing technique   in thoracic pedicle screw placement .
