to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of hbov , we investigated the presence of this virus in children with respiratory tract infection in our region ( gipuzkoa , basque country , spain ) . among the first patients in whom hbov was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates , we found two 12-month - old children with diarrhea in addition to respiratory symptoms . because animal parvoviruses are frequently associated with enteritis in young animals ( 6 ) , we investigated the presence of hbov in the diarrheal feces of both children .
analysis of np1 and vp1 partial gene sequences obtained from all fecal and respiratory hbov - positive samples showed a similarity of > 95% with previously published hbov sequences . of 40 hbov - positive respiratory samples , 25 ( 62.5% ) showed coinfection with other viruses ( respiratory syncytial virus in 13 , rhinovirus in 3 , influenza a in 3 , coronavirus oc43 in 2 , adenovirus in 1 , influenza b in 1 , respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus oc43 in 1 , and influenza a and rhinovirus in 1 ) .
<3 years of age who came to the pediatric emergency unit of our hospital with an episode of acute respiratory infection during the same period , a similar frequency of hbov detection was obtained ( 40/520 , 7.7% ) when nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested .
