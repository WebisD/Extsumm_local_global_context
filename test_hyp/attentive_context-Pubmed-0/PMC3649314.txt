the patient presented with a facial nerve palsy and an accurate diagnosis of non - hodgkins lymphoma at this stage may have prevented the development of this syndrome .
a rare case of garcin s syndrome presented with progressive multiple unilateral cranial nerve palsies due to non - hodgkin s lymphoma . to our knowledge , only one case of garcin s syndrome due to non - hodgkin s lymphoma has been previously reported .
the diagnosis can only be a made with a high clinical suspicion and appropriate diagnostic imaging .
garcin s syndrome was first defined in 1926 by raymond garcin , who defined the  syndrome paralytique unilateral global des nerfs craniens  ( 1 ) .
multiple cranial palsies are rare and often present initially as a single cranial nerve palsy . in our case of garcin s syndrome
garcin s syndrome is characterized by ( 1 ) : 
 ( i)the presence of unilateral palsies of the cranial nerves,(ii)no sensory or motor long tract disturbance,(iii)no intracranial hypertension and(iv)an osteoclastic lesion in the skull base the presence of unilateral palsies of the cranial nerves , no sensory or motor long tract disturbance , no intracranial hypertension and an osteoclastic lesion in the skull base patients reported to have garcin s syndrome do not always have unilateral palsies of all cranial nerves ; thus , this syndrome was redefined as the presence of at least seven ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies .
