we encountered a 52-year - old woman with end - stage oa of the hip accompanied by acetabular dysplasia in whom the quality of life ( qol ) was improved by kampo treatment .
osteoarthritis ( oa ) of the hip induces regressive changes in the hip joint cartilage and subsequent abnormality in the synovial membrane and articular capsule , leading to the impairment of joint function , and osseous changes also occur .
the natural course is influenced by the lifestyle , and it has been reported that x - ray radiographic findings improved in some cases.4 conservative or surgical treatment is selected in the natural course , and the timing is dependent on individual cases . in japan , kampo has been clinically applied for rheumatic diseases for centuries . in this study , we applied kampo for progressive to end - stage coxarthrosis in a female in her 50 s , and achieved improvement of the hip joint function and qol .
primary oa of the hip is defined as coxarthrosis with normal hip joint alignment and acetabular formation.2 in japan , primary cases account for only 0.65% , and many cases are secondary.2 the cause of secondary oa of the hip in which lesions are localized in the hip joint includes congenital hip joint dislocation , acetabular dysplasia , necrosis of the femoral head , and perthes s disease . when acetabular dysplasia remains in the growth period
