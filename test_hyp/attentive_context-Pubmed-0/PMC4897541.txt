owing to this , ( i ) discovering novel screening platform for identifying potential inducers with high efficiency and accuracy and ( ii ) identifying new hbf - inducing agents from the natural world with the combination of efficacy , safety , and ease of use will be high on the agenda .
also , through understanding the pathology of -thalassemia , it is revealed that most of the identified hbf - inducing agents have limitation on treating -thalassemia .
it is because the rapid cellular apoptosis of erythroid progenitors in -thalassemia causes a significant obstacle that overstimulating the cell stress signaling pathway by the hbf inducer may possibly lead to irreversible cellular apoptosis before -globin gene expression and hbf synthesis can be stimulated . with the advancement of biotechnologies , increasing number of studies
genetic disorders caused by mutations in the -globin gene are widely known as the human -hemoglobinopathies , in which -thalassemia and sickle cell disease ( scd ) are the most prevalent ones , particularly in the mediterranean , africa , and southeast asia , leading to great mortality and morbidity   .
chemotherapeutic agents , such as 5-azacytidine , hydroxyurea , myleran , and butyrate , had long been used for -thalassemia treatment by stimulating hbf synthesis ; yet , cytotoxicity , growth - inhibitory effect , fear of long - term carcinogenesis , and only modest hbf - inducing activity have limited the clinical usage of these agents in -thalassemia and scd treatment .
