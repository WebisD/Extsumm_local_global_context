the present study demonstrates that the amount of young - adult subcutaneous adipose tissue was associated with bmi changes both during late childhood and adolescence , although young - adult visceral adipose tissue areas were associated with bmi changes specifically during adolescence .
the main objective of the present study was to investigate the association between bmi changes during different developmental periods and young - adult fat distribution in a well - characterized cohort of young - adult men .
a major strength of the present study is that both the subcutaneous and the visceral adipose tissue areas were measured using abdominal ct scans , giving us the opportunity to determine the predictive value of developmental bmi changes for these two fat depots separately . in a danish study , including men born between 1930 and 1956 , it was shown that subjects with both increases and decreases in bmi between 7 and 13 years of age had a higher risk of obesity in adulthood compared with those who maintained their bmi level ( 35 ) .
the gothenburg osteoporosis and obesity determinants ( good ) study was initiated with the aim to determine both environmental and genetic factors involved in the regulation of fat mass as previously described ( 23 ) . to be included in the good study , subjects had to be male , 18 to 20 years of age , and willing to participate in the study
