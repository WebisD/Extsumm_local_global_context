in conclusion , the combination of functional imaging with the new tools for intraoperative dose calculation and optimization opens new and exciting times in brachytherapy .
new optimized protocols are needed and should be tested in controlled trials , to demonstrate an advantage of such a new paradigm .
moreover , in the last five years , technological advances in radiology and nuclear medicine gave us more understanding of the topography and metabolism of tumors , and a new dimension to optimize radiation therapy , including brachytherapy .
prostate brachytherapy has open a new era in organ and function conservation and became the most prominent example of highly conformal therapies .
the use of brachytherapy in breast cancer has contributed to the change of paradigm in breast conserving therapies for early stage low risk breast cancer .
it implements sophisticated tools for applicator placement , dose optimization and delivery , but its inherent physical charateristics ( internal sources , rapid fall - off of the dose and gradient generation at the edge of target volumes ) causes brachytherapy to become self - optimized by nature . no other conformal therapy ( except maybe proton therapy ) can achieve the degree of conformation and low integral doses to the rest of the anatomy . since many years brachytherapy has played a major role in the treatment of cancer .
