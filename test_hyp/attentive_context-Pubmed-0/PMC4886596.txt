the presentation of a patient with two unrelated genetic disorders is uncommon , although not statistically impossible .
its course is unpredictable : it can cause a variety of benign nerve tumors including plexiform , dermal , and optic glioma tumors ; in some cases malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can develop in the plexiform tumours .
he was a known case of down 's syndrome with a history of seizures in childhood [ figure 1 ] .
our patient had down 's syndrome , neurofibromatosis , dental anomalies , and ocular defects and keloids . in the large majority of cases , trisomy 21
down 's syndrome is one of the most common and easily recognized genetic conditions in humans .
mutations in the gene results in abnormal control of cell growth , differentiation , and aberrant myelination . our patient with of neurofibrmatosis type 1 with down 's syndrome is the first such to have a keloid and sebaceous cyst apart from myopia and dental anomalies . the unpredictable nature and course of the two genetic disorders along with multiple acquired conditions in this patient make it difficult for patients , teachers , care givers , and medical / dental providers to create and maintain long - term care plans . the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s )
