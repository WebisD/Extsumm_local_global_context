we also show that 
 the lateral radial distribution function between all molecular pair 
 types ( chol  chol , chol - dppc , dppc 
finally , we use 
 rest to obtain the gibbs free energy profiles between different molecular 
 pair types from the corresponding lateral radial distribution functions .
also , combined with umbrella sampling , 
 rest can be used to accelerate relaxation on degrees of freedom orthogonal 
 to the reaction coordinate , which is reported as a hurdle in free 
 energy calculations for lipid membranes .
molecular dynamics simulations 
 have been used as a powerful tool 
 to study lipid membranes but are limited by the length and time scales 
 of the probing systems . in particular , the lateral diffusion rate 
 of a lipid in a membrane , although varying among different experimental 
 techniques , is in the range 1010 cm s. this means that it will take a lipid about 
 hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds time scale to cover a 1 nm area .
we show that rest can be used as an efficient way 
 to accelerate lateral equilibration in a mixed lipid bilayer .
temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics ( t - remd ) is one 
 of the methods that has been widely used to accelerate equilibration 
 in simulations and achieved numerous success in protein folding .
