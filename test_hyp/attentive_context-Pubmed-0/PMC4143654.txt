, we suggest that it may be important to share the history of antimicrobials usage 
 across the first and secondary medical care settings of companion animals to avoid treatment 
 with several antimicrobials in the same period and to avoid extensive , continuous treatment 
 with the same class antimicrobial . in conclusion , this study revealed that the higher prevalence of concomitant resistant and 
 intermediate interpretations to fluoroquinolones , aminopenicillins and chl in isolates from 
 the university hospital than in isolates from the community clinics was due not only to the 
 acquisition of specific resistance mechanisms , such as -lactamases , cata1 
 and qrdr mutations , but also to overexpression of the acrab  tolc efflux pump in canine 
 e. coli .
in this study , e. coli isolates with resistant or an intermediate 
 interpretation to aminopenicillins , chl or fluoroquinolone were more frequently obtained 
 from dogs admitted to the universal hospital than from those admitted to the community 
 clinics . remarkably , isolates with resistance to fluoroquinolones
it indicated a need 
 to investigate the mechanism underlying the emergence of this multidrug - resistance 
 phenotype . to characterize in detail the fluoroquinolone - resistant isolates obtained from the 
 university hospital and community clinics studied here , we investigated 
 antimicrobial - resistance mechanisms of e. coli isolates derived from dogs 
 using enr - supplemented dhl agar plates .
