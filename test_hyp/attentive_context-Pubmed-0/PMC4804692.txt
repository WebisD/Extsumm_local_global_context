test ordering was significantly more common for those with an overweight or obesity diagnosis in the emr : aap guideline - recommended tests were ordered for 39 of 91 ( 42.3% ) patients with a correct diagnosis versus 8 of 124 ( 6.5% ) missing a correct diagnosis ( p < .001 ; table 4 ) .
overweight and obesity were common in our urban , predominantly medicaid - insured clinic population , with a combined prevalence of 41% .
in addition , test ordering was more common when bmi was at or above the 95th percentile ; recommended tests were ordered for 31.9% of obese children and 10.0% of overweight children ( p < .001 ) .
overall , screening tests consistent with 2007 aap guidelines were ordered for 21.9% of patients with obesity and overweight .
10 years , 52 ( 57.1% ) had a correct diagnosis in the emr , while among the 124 children aged 2 to 9 years , only 39 ( 31.5% ) had a correct diagnosis in the emr ( p < .001 ; table 3 ) .
similar to findings in other studies , rates of documentation of overweight and obesity by practitioners were low and worse for younger children and for those with milder degrees of excess weight .
