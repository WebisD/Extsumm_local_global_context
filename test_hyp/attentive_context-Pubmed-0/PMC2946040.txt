an 18-year - old male presented with a complaint of chest discomfort , exertional dyspnea , and an intractable dry cough .
we recommend that when a patient is positioned that the center of the mass should be located in the dependent site of the body .
our patient also complained of exertional dyspnea , and thus , we should have expected hypoxemia or hypotension during general anesthesia . in conclusion , positional changes can be used to relieve an unexpected airway obstruction caused by an anterior mediastinal mass .
although the pulmonary trunk was not compressed by preoperative mdct in our case , the positional change might have caused a mass effect on the right heart or pulmonary artery and the observed increase in cvp .
although the patient underwent a fluoroscopy - guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy twice , the type of tumor was not confirmed , and thus , a thoracotomic incisional biopsy was decided upon under general anesthesia .
furthermore , a peak expiratory flow rate ( pefr ) by the pulmonary function test ( pft ) of less than 50% of the predicted value should raise concerns about complications due to a mediastinal mass . in our patient , the preoperative tracheal cross - sectional area was patent , but pefr by pft was 50% of predicted and minimal pericardial effusion was observed by echocardiography .
