pe has been listed as stressors of stress - induced cardiomyopathy,2)3 ) because the pain and the decreased perfusion within the lung related to pe probably cause a release of catecholamines.4)5 ) however , it is uncommon to present reverse types of stress - induced cardiomyopathy in the setting of pe for our patient .
the pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear , however , the catecholamine excess and increased sympathetic activity are likely to play a pivotal role in triggering this syndrome.1 - 3 ) in this report , we describe an unusual case of a 38-year - old woman who had pulmonary embolism ( pe ) and reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy .
takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular ( lv ) regional wall motion abnormalities and usually involves apical segments in the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis . in the recent years , several cases on atypical forms of transient lv ballooning syndrome have been reported .
diagnosing pe especially in a patient with characteristics of acute coronary syndrome such as stressinduced cardiomyopathy can be difficult .
herein , we report a middle - aged woman with inverted takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of pe , which is a rare coexistence for this association .
