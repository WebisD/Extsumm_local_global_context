thus , the objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of six different pre - milking teat preparation procedures on lowering the staphylococcal , streptococcal and coliform bacterial count on teat skin .
in conclusion , bacterial numbers , specifically staphylococcal and streptococcal numbers on cow teat surfaces , were significantly reduced when disinfection products were applied to teats .
the use of wipes was particularly effective due to the physical wiping action in conjunction with the disinfectant application .
given the level of bacterial numbers on non - prepared teats and the reduction observed with chemical disinfectant , it may be advisable to include this process as part of the milking routine .
however , the results of this study would indicate that the probability of a reduction in staphylococcal and streptococcal counts could be expected to be greater where a disinfectant is used pre - milking compared to ' washing and drying ' or ' no preparation ' treatments .
six pre - milking teat preparations were applied to spring calving holstein friesian cows during two herd management periods , while cows were housed ( indoors ) and while cows were grazed on pastures ( outdoors ) . during the indoor period and for the previous three months
