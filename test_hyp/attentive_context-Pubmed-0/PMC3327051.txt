a detailed understanding of the molecular biology of vc carcinogenesis has provided new ways of studying the molecular epidemiology of vc carcinogenesis in exposed humans , which in turn have provided the basis for new approaches to the prevention and treatment of vc - related cancer .
this model could also have much broader implications ; since other potential carcinogenic exposures in the plastics industry and elsewhere share some of the same molecular biologic pathways of metabolism and repair as vc similar molecular epidemiologic biomarkers could be useful for monitoring their carcinogenic process , and since many different types of common human cancers contain either or both p53 and k - ras mutations similar molecularly targeted approaches to chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis could have wide applicability .
vc is an also an excellent model for the study of chemical carcinogenesis via genotoxic mechanisms because it is a well - known dna - reactive chemical , for which much has been learned about the molecular biology of its pathways of action [ figure 1 ] .
it should be noted that although the mutagenic pathways for vc carcinogenesis have been the best studied and are thus the focus here , it is quite possible that other mechanisms could contribute significantly to vc carcinogenesis through more indirect pathways , including , for example , through epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression or alterations in immune surveillance . the molecular biologic and molecular epidemiologic pathways of vc carcinogenesis
