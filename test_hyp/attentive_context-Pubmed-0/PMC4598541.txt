the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of arthroscopic repair of various types of meniscal tears using the fast - fix ultra system , applying standard all - inside or outside - in suturing techniques .
the mean postoperative lysholm score of the operated knees was 85.7  12.8 ( range 51100 ) , which was significantly better than the mean preoperative value of 47.8  10.4 ( range 2562 ) ( p < 0.001 , paired t - test ) . the mean preinjury tegner activity score was 7.4  1.6 ( range 59 ) and the mean preoperative tegner score was 2.1  0.9 ( range 04 ) , which increased postoperatively to 7.2  2.2 ( range 410 ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
meniscal repair with the fast - fix meniscal repair system provides excellent clinical results in the vast majority of patients , with a success rate of 91.7% in this relatively short term followup study ; this is comparable to the success rates of traditional suture techniques .
meniscectomy was initially viewed as a simple and at least in the short term , effective approach to treat meniscus injuries . with the recognition that meniscectomy carried the latent risk of cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis in the long term , new approaches to correct meniscus injuries
