the imh was interpreted as a stable and non - emergency finding , and the patient was treated medically . due to an episode of recurrent chest pain , the patient was referred to our cardiac surgical unit the next morning . as a part of a preoperative work - up in preparation for urgent surgery , another follow - up ct scan was conducted . the rationale behind this decision was to determine whether the status of the imh had changed and to determine whether an intimal tear could be detected .
