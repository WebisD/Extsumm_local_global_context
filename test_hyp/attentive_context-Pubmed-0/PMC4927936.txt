efforts are needed to reduce the gap between the exploratory up - stream identification of candidate biomarkers , the validation of biomarkers against clear clinical endpoints in different populations , and the development of simple point of care tests for use in low resourced settings .
we will review most of the recent advances in research into tb biomarkers for the diagnosis of active tb , latent tb infection ( ltbi ) and prevention of tb disease .
there is a pressing need for new biomarkers in tb at all different levels discussed above . though studies on new candidate biomarkers are numerous , validation and independent confirmation are rare , unfortunately .
tuberculosis ( tb ) is a communicable infectious disease , spread almost exclusively by coughed aerosols carrying pathogens from the mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) complex .
sputum diagnostics are not useful in extra - pulmonary disease , the diagnosis of which relies on samples ( tissue or biological fluids as pleural- , cerebral- , synovial - fluids ) collected by invasive procedures . for all of these reasons , there is need for the development of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for tb to rapidly identify - or rule out - the presence of active disease .
