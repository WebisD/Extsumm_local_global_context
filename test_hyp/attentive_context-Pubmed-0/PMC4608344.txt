, we presented a 13-year - old boy with complaint of two times drop attack and final diagnosis of colloid cyst in the third brain ventricle .
a 13-year - old boy was brought to the emergency department ( ed ) with complaint of two times drop attack .
so , recognition of this rare but important diagnosis may result in decreasing mortality ( 4 ) . in this report
they are congenital benign tumor accounting for 15 - 20 % of intraventricular mass but only about 1% of intracranial ones ( 1 - 3 ) .
there is also the rare report of spontaneous resolving of the third ventricle colloid cyst ( 12 , 13 ) .
they usually found incidentally and are asymptomatic ; but in some instances may associate with rapid neurologic deterioration , herniation , and sudden death .
a hyperdense round lesion was seen in the third ventricle consequently caused that the corresponding physician requested a neurologic consultation in the ed . finally , the brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) confirmed the diagnosis of third ventricle colloid cyst and the patient was underwent surgery and discharged without any problem ( figure 2 ) .
