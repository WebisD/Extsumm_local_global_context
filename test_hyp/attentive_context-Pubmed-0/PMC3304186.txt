the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter .
this study shows the extreme accuracy of this conventional surgical stent . if each step of this protocol is followed precisely , it is possible to deliver an optimum implant installation in terms of position and diameter and later on function at a very much reduced rate and time , as taken in ct and cad / cam technology which are the most accepted methods
the drill holes can directly be made through the stent , so the implant surgery may become less traumatic ( with the preservation of soft tissue including the gingival margins of adjacent teeth and the interdental papilla ) with decreased operative time which results in accelerated post - surgical healing , fewer post - operative complications and increased comfort and satisfaction for the patient .
the possibility of displacement of stent during implant surgery was minimized by extension of the stent antero - posteriorly to cover enough area over the teeth / tooth present adjacent to edentulous area . in cases where no teeth are present ,
