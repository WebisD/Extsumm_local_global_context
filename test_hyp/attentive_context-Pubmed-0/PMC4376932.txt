we report an anti - gbm antibody - positive patient with fgn associated with tma .
anti - glomerular basement membrane ( gbm ) antibody glomerulonephritis is considered to be a glomerular nephritis of a systemic disease . here ,
according to the world health organization 's classification of glomerular diseases , both thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma )   and fibrillary glomerulonephritis ( fgn )   consist of glomerular lesions , the former in the context of a vascular disease and the latter in the setting of a metabolic disease .
our patient was a 54-year - old male who presented with anuria , fever , and lower - leg edema .
a previous study reported a case of fgn in which repeat plasma exchange therapy resulted in remission of refractory nephrotic syndrome .
while admitting the possibility that high levels of anti - gbm antibodies had a complicating impact on tma or fgn , we considered it unlikely that anti - gbm nephritis was the primary cause given the renal biopsy findings . with all of the above taken into consideration , we concluded that the patient had fgn associated with tma and high levels of anti - gbm antibodies .
