the objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence and genetically characterize t. gondii in wild animals from fuzhou zoo and pet birds farms in fujian province , southeastern china .
further genotyping analysis confirmed that the presence of t. gondii in zoo wildlife and pet birds were toxodb genotype # 10 , genotype # 9 and genotype # 2 , which suggested the integrated measures should be taken to prevent t. gondii infection in humans or other animals .
the positive rate of t. gondii dna in zoo animals was significantly higher than that of pet birds in fujian , china ( p<0.05 .
the results in this present study will enhance our understanding of the epidemiology and prevention of t. gondii in zoo wild animals and pet birds .
the positive rate of t. gondii dna was high in zoo animals ( 7/45 , 15.56% ) but very low in birds ( 3/140 , 2.14% ) in fujian , china .
a total of 185 animals were randomly collected from fujian province during 2012 and 2014 .
the high genetic diversity of t. gondii genotypes in fujian may cause by the high number of cats in city and other feline in mountainous areas .
