we discuss the structure and function of -actinin-4 , and we review mechanisms by which mutations in -actinin-4 may lead to podocyte injury and fsgs .
glomerular visceral epithelial cells ( gecs ; podocytes ) play a key role in the maintenance of glomerular permselectivity   . under normal conditions , podocytes are in contact with extracellular matrix , and there appears to be little turnover of podocytes , as these cells are highly differentiated (  terminally differentiated  ) .
in addition , fsgs may be associated with heritable mutations in several distinct proteins that play key roles in maintaining gec ultrastructure , including podocin , -actinin-4 , transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily c , member 6 ( trpc6 ) , inverted formin 2 and others . in this paper , we focus on mutations in -actinin-4 , which are associated with an autosomal dominant late - onset fsgs in humans .
gecs form a tight network of interdigitating foot processes , which are bridged by filtration - slit diaphragms , and permselectivity of the glomerular capillary wall is dependent on the maintenance of appropriate structure of podocytes and of their foot processes .
, evidence has accumulated to support the view that the early pathogenesis of fsgs is associated with gec injury , leading to apoptosis , detachment of gecs from extracellular matrix , and  podocytopenia  , which is followed by glomerulosclerosis   .
