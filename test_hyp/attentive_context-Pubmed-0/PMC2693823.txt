however , these laboratory tests can not identify the genes causing the category ii or iv disease , which await further progress and understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of patients with eds - iv - like phenotypes .
here , we report three patients with a provisional diagnosis of eds type iv . the first and second patients had mutations of the gene for type iii procollagen ( col3a1 ) .
, we emphasize that patients with a presentation suggestive of eds iv should undergo biochemical analysis of their type iii collagen and dna analysis of the col3a1 , tgfbr1 , and tgfbr2 genes .
this new syndrome was designated loeys - dietz syndrome , type 2 ( 4 , 5 ) . here , we report our experience of three korean patients , in whom a clinical diagnosis of eds type iv was made based on clinical findings .
however , a genetic study identified col3a1 mutations in two of these three patients . in the other one patient
the classification of ehlers - danlos syndrome ( eds ) is based on the extent of clinical and pathological features .
 receptors 1 and 2 ( tgfbr1 and tgfbr2 , respectively ) have been identified in patients with a provisional diagnosis of eds type iv without the characteristic type iii collagen abnormalities .
