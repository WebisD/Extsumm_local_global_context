( 2 ) this article describes the case of a 15 year old boy , with known hme , referred to the sarcoma mdt with a 9.5 cm diameter mass in the popliteal fossa , confirmed by ultrasound as a delayed presentation of a pseudoaneurysm .
it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion of an increasing soft tissue lesion due to the risk of sarcomatous transformation in patients with mhe ; however , this focus delayed earlier presentation to vascular surgeons putting the patient at risk of a limb threatening rupture .
diaphyseal aclasis , also termed hereditary multiple exostosis ( hme ) or osteochondromatosis is characterised by multiple bony prominences that grow near joint lines throughout the skeleton .
a 15-year - old boy , with diaphyseal aclasis , presented with a two month history of a painful swelling in his left popliteal fossa , reportedly increasing in size .
( 1 ) there have been approximately 100 cases in the literature of vascular complications due to osteochondromas including pseudoaneurysm formation , occlusion , rupture or thrombosis .
this case illustrates a late presentation of a known complication associated with diaphseal aclasis . in this age group
