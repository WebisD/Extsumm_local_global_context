a 64-year - old caucasian male presented to the emergency room complaining of progressive fatigue for 3 months which had progressed to the point of hindering his usual activities of daily living ( adl ) .
he had recently visited his primary care provider for evaluation of a non - productive cough and exertional shortness of breath .
helicobacter pylori infection was ruled out eliminating the possibility of treating him with eradication therapy .
initial investigations in the emergency room revealed severe anemia and a positive stool guaiac test .
he was treated symptomatically with transfusion of packed red blood cells ( prbc ) and intravenous iron followed by radiotherapy .
gastric and transbronchial biopsies were suggestive of extra - nodal marginal zone b - cell lymphoma with simultaneous metastasis to the bronchi .
malt lymphomas were once thought to be localized to one organ , but this concept has since been disproved ; multiple case reports and case series have demonstrated its multi - organ involvement at presentation or on subsequent staging . therefore , thorough staging and diagnostic work up should be completed on all newly diagnosed malt lymphoma cases before initiation of any treatment .
non - invasive helicobacter pylori testing as stool antigen or blood antibody test should be tested if helicobacter pylori is negative by histopathology .
