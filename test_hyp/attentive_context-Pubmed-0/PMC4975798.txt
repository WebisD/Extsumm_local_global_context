the guide presented a two - step approach in which the credibility of the process of a systematic review is evaluated first ( comprehensive literature search , rigorous study selection process , etc ) .
another challenge to the notion of having systematic reviews on the top of the evidence pyramid relates to the framework presented in the journal of the american medical association user 's guide on systematic reviews and meta - analysis .
for example , a meta - analysis of rcts evaluating intensive glycaemic control in non - critically ill hospitalised patients showed a non - significant reduction in mortality ( relative risk of 0.95 ( 95% ci 0.72 to 1.25)9 ) .
for example , we are quite certain about the benefits of hip replacement in a patient with disabling hip osteoarthritis .
in the early 2000s , the grading of recommendations assessment , development and evaluation ( grade ) working group developed a framework in which the certainty in evidence was based on numerous factors and not solely on study design which challenges the pyramid concept.8 study design alone appears to be insufficient on its own as a surrogate for risk of bias . certain methodological limitations of a study , imprecision , inconsistency and indirectness , were factors independent from study design and can affect the quality of evidence derived from any study design .
