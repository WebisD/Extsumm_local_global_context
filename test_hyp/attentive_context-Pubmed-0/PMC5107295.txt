equina enhancement post spinal cord infarct has been described in a few case reports and attributed to a possible disruption of blood - nerve barrier.2,8,9 in conclusion , further studies are required to test our hypothesis that reappearance of tibial and peroneal f waves has a prognostic value in predicting walking in patients with conus medullaris infarct .
a 48-year - old man presented with acute lower extremity weakness and back pain developed while he was working in a crawl space hyper extending his back .
we suspect the mechanism of infarct was secondary to a hyperextension injury similar to the non - traumatic spinal cord infarct described in novice surfers ( surfers myelopathy ) . in such cases , the postulated mechanisms of ischemia include transient arterial compression during a prolonged back hyperextension in the setting of poor collaterals , vasospasm or thrombosis of the artery of adamkiewicz , and avulsion of perforating blood vessels.4,5 the prognosis of surfers myelopathy varies from complete recovery to persistent paraparesis.4,5 a normal mri in the first few days does not rule out spinal cord infarct . in reported case series ,
we would not expect f waves to be recordable in the setting of a diffuse infarction of all ahc in the spinal cord segments subserving the tested nerve .
