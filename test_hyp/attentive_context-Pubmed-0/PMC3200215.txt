this unique technology combines a proprietary sample preparation protocol , the lc / ms method , and statistical data analysis tools to quantitatively analyze proteins from whole tissue homogenates , cell lysates , or depleted serum / plasma samples .   in this work , we used cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) samples from a - t patients and age- and gender - matched unaffected controls to identify and verify potential biomarkers of a - t .
csf was selected as it has been shown to be a relevant biological sample to study other neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , and to study changes in the predominant clinical phenotype of a - t ( neurodegeneration ) that have not been addressed in previous studies   .
expression differences of proenkephalin - a ( penk , p01210 ) , isoform 1 of extracellular matrix protein 1 ( ecm1 , q16610 ) , secretogranin-2 ( scg2 , p13521 ) , isoform 1 of cd166 antigen ( alcam , q13740 ) , and insulin - like growth factor binding protein 7 ( igfbp7 , q16270 ) can clearly discriminate a - t samples from healthy controls.the   literature search results demonstrate that these five proteins are involved in either human cancers or neurodegenerative processes   .
