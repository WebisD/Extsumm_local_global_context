the purpose of the present case report is to discuss the endodontic procedure adopted to negotiate the complex tooth morphology of a peg - shaped mli with di and five root canals ( frc ) .
case selection is the key in successful outcome of a treatment . treating a tooth with a unique morphology
nevertheless , advanced radiographic techniques such as the cone beam computed tomogram ( cbct ) helps in a three - dimensional evaluation of a particular tooth to overcome the limitations of conventional radiography .
the common developmental anomalies in a maxillary lateral incisor ( mli ) includes peg - shaped crown , radicular groove , talon cusp , and dens invaginatus ( di ) . from an endodontic perspective
success in endodontic treatment is best defined by the contemporary endodontic triad of diagnosis , anatomy , and debridement . in the learning curve of endodontics ,
definitely tests the clinical knowledge , skill of the operator and one should be ready for any kind of pulp space variant that could exist . although , cbct would have been beneficial to precisely define and confirm the canal location in a complicated morphology , the present case illustrates the successful negotiation with conventional radiographs .
