series we present the results of bal performed in three patients with severe influenza a / h1n1 2009 pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
several studies reported histophatological observations during influenza a / h1n1 2009 pneumonia : the major finding was diffuse alveolar damage ( dad )   .
the main characteristic of the bal of our patients with influenza a / h1n1 pneumonia associated with ards was the presence of large cells with a plasmoblastic / plasmocytoid - like appearance , identified at em as atypical type ii pneumocytes .
between august and december 2009 we performed a bronchoscopy - guided bal of three patients admitted to the san gerardo hospital , monza , italy , for influenza a / h1n1 virus pneumonia with subsequent development of ards .
plasmoblastic / plasmocytoid - like type ii pneumocytes characterize the bal of our patients with influenza a / h1n1 2009 pneumonia associated with ards .
more observations of bal cytology in patients with influenza pneumonia are needed to understand their characteristics and role .
type ii pneumocytes were considered the main target of influenza a / h1n1 infection . a limited number of observations described in vivo samples , such as bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal )   .
