we report a case of a patient who presented with a complex open 3c gustilo  anderson fracture who subsequently developed flap failure , failed internal fixation complicated with osteomyelitis of the talus .
our management involved a single - staged talectomy to remove the infected bone and tackle the inadequate soft tissue coverage , external fixation for tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis to achieve joint stability and a combination of bone graft antibiotics and a course of intravenous and oral antibiotics postoperatively to deal with the underlying osteomyelitis .
soft tissue defects of the foot pose further challenges given the specially adapted architecture to facilitate tendon gliding .
reported amputation rates in open midfoot fractures are 30% highlighting their severity , coexisting soft tissue compromise , infection and difficulty covering midfoot injuries with flaps . with the midfoot playing a key role in foot function ,
open fractures are poorly reported since they are rare and usually treated in specialist trauma centres .
they vary in severity from minor metatarsal / phalangeal fractures to complicated midfoot and hindfoot injuries .
there is a need for randomized controlled trials to investigate the most appropriate fixation technique for tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis . in conclusion , we report a good outcome treating an open 3c gustilo  anderson fracture complicated by osteomyelitis , necrosis and inadequate soft tissue coverage .
