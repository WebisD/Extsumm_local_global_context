heavily pretreated patients with egfr - resistant nsclc and cns metastases benefited from treatment with afatinib in this cup . in light of the lack of established treatment options in this setting ,
ttf for patients with known egfr mutations ( n = 72 ) was 4.0 months , for patients with unknown mutational status ( n = 20 ) 3.6 months , and for wild - type patients ( n = 8) 1.3 months .
the patient experienced a partial response with little side effects ( grade 1 : diarrhea and rash ) . in january 2013 , the dosage of afatinib was increased to 60 mg / day and in april 2013 to 70 mg / day at the discretion of the treating physician . in october 2013 , after 16 months of treatment with afatinib , the patient died due to rapid tumor progression .
nineteen percent ( 6 of 31 ) had a general response ( defined as systemic and cns response ) , 16% ( 5 of 31 ) had a cerebral response only , and 13% ( 4 of 31 ) had a systemic response only .
characteristics of the patients with and without cns metastasis and of the matched group without cns metastasis all patients in the cup were pretreated with chemotherapy and erlotinib / gefitinib ; first - line therapy was a platinum doublet in the majority ( 64% ) , and erlotinib ( 13% ) and gefitinib ( 22% ) in a subset ( table 2 ) .
