few studies with considerable numbers of patients have reported the clinical and imaging characteristics of this rare condition in different geographic regions.511 in this paper , we report the features of orbital metastatic lesions among patients in the delta region of egypt over the last 15 years .
this was a retrospective study which included all patients who were histologically proven to have orbital metastatic lesions at tanta university eye hospital over the last 15 years ( 20002014 ) .
a high index of suspicion is required , as 24.3% did not have history of cancer in our study and orbital lesion was the first manifestation of the disease .
breast carcinoma represented 21.6% of cases ( eight patients ) , followed by hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , which represented 16.2% ( six patients ) .
a high incidence of orbital metastasis from hcc was found , which , as far as we are aware , has not been reported by any previous study ; this can be explained on the basis of the increased incidence of hcc in the egyptian population .
the next common primary tumor site was cutaneous malignant melanoma , which accounted for 13.5% of patients ( five cases ) , followed by bronchogenic carcinoma , prostatic carcinoma , and thyroid adenocarcinoma , each of which accounted for 8.1% of patients ( three cases of each type ) .
