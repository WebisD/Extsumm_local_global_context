the purpose of this study was to determine the risk of vap for diabetic and nondiabetic patients with normal glycemic control who underwent mv for at least 48 h.
table 3 shows that aging patients versus patients less than 30 years of age ( 3.12 ; 95% ci : 1.566.25 ; p = 0.001 ) , and thin ( 5.1 ; 95% ci : 1.124.57 ; p = 0.04 ) and overweight ( 2.75 ; 95% ci : 1.415.37 ; p = 0.003 ) patients versus patients of normal weight have a higher hazard of progression to vap .
association between prognostic factors and progression to vap in cox proportional hazard regression multivariate analysis icu mortality rates in diabetic and nondiabetic patients in our study were 37.5% and 28.6% , respectively ( p = 0.32 ) .
icu mortality increased by 66.6% ( p < 0.0001 ) when diabetic patients developed vap , remaining an independent predictor of mortality [ hazard ratio ( hr ) 18.18 ; 95% ci : 4.76100 ] [ table 3 ] .
survival curves of 186 patients with different baseline characteristics of t2 dm as shown in figure 1 , the median time from hospitalization to vap occurrence in diabetic patients was lower than in nondiabetic patients [ 9.34 ( 95% ci : 7.3911.29 ) and 34.32 ( 95% ci : 31.8136.83 ) days , respectively ; p < 0.0001 ] .
