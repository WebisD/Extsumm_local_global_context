the aim of this study is to identify the clinical profile of ar patients according to aria guidelines and investigate the common allergens in abuja , nigeria .
this cross - sectional study was conducted for a period of 18 months ( march 2014 to september 2015 ) .
a self - reported survey of ar among adult nigerians observed a prevalence of 29.6% and a mean age of 29.3 years   which was close to the mean age observed in this study . the number of patients in this study with concomitant asthma is lower than other nigerian studies   and this could be due to small sample size or poor awareness of asthma symptoms by the respondents .
sensitization patterns are not related to aria classification or any predominant ar symptoms but rather may rely on the environmental condition of study area and genetic makeup of the study population .
, most ar patients presenting for treatment in abuja , nigeria , have moderate - severe persistent ar and show similar spt sensitization pattern with other countries having similar climatic conditions .
this study highlights the importance of pollen allergens among ar patients living in nigeria , a tropical country with high humidity .
