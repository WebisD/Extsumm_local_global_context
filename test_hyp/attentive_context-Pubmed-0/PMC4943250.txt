all 3 studies reported a protective role of a more antiinflammatory diet.18 , 19 , 20 these recent studies have begun to fill an important gap in understanding the relationship between systemic inflammation  a phenomenon with multiple underlying causes  and cardiovascular disease , by focusing specifically on diet , which appears to be a key modifiable factor involved in inflammatory pathways.10 , 11 , 12 additionally , to the best of our knowledge , no study has yet investigated the association of the dii with the incidence of specific cvd subtypes . in order to contribute to filling this research gap , we assessed the prospective association between the inflammatory potential of the diet , as measured by the dii , and the incidence of overall cvd and subtypes of cvd  namely , mi ; strokes ; angina pectoris and revascularization interventions  in a large cohort of french adults with a longterm followup .
in this large cohort study of middleaged french adults , a prospective association was found between a proinflammatory diet , as reflected by higher dii scores , and the incidence of myocardial infarction over a 13year period , even after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders including sociodemographic data and lifestyle habits .
