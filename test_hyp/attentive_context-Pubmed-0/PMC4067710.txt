gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma ( nec ) is an uncommon tumor with a strong malignant potential and an extremely poor prognosis . in the present case report
, we describe a patient who had undergone ge with braun enteroenterostomy ( bee ) 50 years prior to presentation and had developed a mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma ( manec ) at the anastomotic site .
a 75-year - old man was diagnosed with gastric cancer in june 2012 at showa university fujigaoka hospital .
we surmise that in our case , the constant exposure to secondary bile may have induced a gastric mucosal adenocarcinoma , which finally differentiated into a nec .
distal gastrectomy is a well - known risk factor for developing gastric stump cancer later . in particular
similarly , in our case we observed an nec on the jejunal side of the tumor and an adenocarcinoma inside the tumor .
, cancer frequently occurs near the gastrojejunostomy site in the remnant stomach following a billroth ii reconstruction .
one proposed theory is that the enterogastric reflux of bile and pancreatic secretions chronically irritate the gastric mucosa promoting neoplasia .
fifty years previously , he had undergone a gastric bypass operation with a loop gastrojejunostomy to treat stenosis caused by a duodenal ulcer .
