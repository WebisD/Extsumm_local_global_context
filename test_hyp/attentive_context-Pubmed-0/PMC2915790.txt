we performed the ts - dna gene sequence in 68 cancer samples from patients of different dukes ' stages ( a , b , and c ) and histological grade but we did not find any change in the ts - dna structure .
this variant form presents a replacement of an evolutionary conserved tyrosine by a histidine at residue 33 of the ts polypeptide   ; this mutation represents the only difference between the two ts forms and must account for the structural and functional differences between them . in an our previous paper we performed the analysis of the ts structure in patients bearing crc   to try to demonstrate the presence of that specific mutation , but we did not find it in any patient . here , we intend to proceed on the use of sequencing techniques to see if any ts variant form could be present in human cancer samples from patients who underwent surgery for primary colorectal cancer and previously untreated and try to find relationship between any hypothetical ts variant form with the 5-fu treatment .        
what remains is to evaluate the ts gene structure of the d metastatic dukes ' crcs : in these tumours it might be possible to find ts - dna structural changes related with their higher genomic instability and this fact could give an explanation of the 5-fu drug resistance and worse prognosis .
