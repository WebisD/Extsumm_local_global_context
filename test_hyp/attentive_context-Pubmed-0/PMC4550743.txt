the present study is , to our knowledge , the first one to determine and assess simultaneously , in a group of healthy and hypertensive pregnant women , the vascular reactivity or ef by using three different but complementary methods in conjunction with the determination of central and peripheral arterial structural and functional parameters .
the main results of this work were as follows : ( 1 ) central aortic blood pressure and wave reflections as well as elastic ( aortic and carotid ) arteries stiffness are increased in pe , with respect to peripheral blood pressure - matched gh and hp , and ( 2 ) pe showed both resting ( l - fmc ) and recruitable ( fmd and pwvcr% ) endothelial dysfunction . among the methods that allow measurement of vascular reactivity or ef in the clinical setting , fmd has rapidly gained popularity because of its simplicity , reproducibility , and noninvasiveness   .
in addition , changes in arterial stiffness assessed by means of carotid - to - radial pulse wave velocity ( pwvcr ) due to the same test ( vrt ) have been proposed as an alternative tool for the evaluation of ef   .
