taken together , these results show that rnai silencing of the a2b receptor gene alters the phenotype of hepg2 cells , and this method might lead to development of novel therapies for the human hepatocellular carcinoma .
fcm experiments revealed that 89.56  3.15% of stably transfected cells were in the g1 phase .
in contrast , stably transfected cells showed a decreased colony forming ability of 60.33  9.6% compared with hepg2 cells ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 4 ( b ) ) . to explore the mechanism of growth suppression in a2br - silencing cells ,
, rna interference ( rnai ) has been widely used to study gene expression regulation in mammalian cells and therapeutic intervention for various diseases including cancer . in this study
recently , spychala discovered that activation of adenosine receptors may be involved in tumor progression .   in a previous study , we collected 64 samples of hepatocellular carcinoma from clinical patients and found that a2b receptors were highly expressed in tumor tissue and expressed in peritumoral tissues to a lesser extent by real - time pcr , western blot , and immunohistochemical staining .
a2b receptors have been implicated in mast cell activation   and asthma , vasodilation , regulation of cell growth , intestinal function , and modulation of neurosecretion . in a previous study , we found that a2b receptors were highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue , indicating that expression of the a2b receptor may contribute to tumor progression and may be a good therapeutic target for liver cancer .
