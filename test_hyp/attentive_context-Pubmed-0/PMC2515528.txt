, this h mrs study at 7 t indicates that the rapid acquisition of high - quality h nmr spectra from subcutaneous fat and from bone marrow is straightforward in healthy volunteers , and that the spectra may be analyzed to assess triglyceride composition .
this may facilitate longitudinal monitoring of changes in lipid composition in response to diet , exercise , and disease .
proton - decoupled c nmr of human adipose tissue ( 1519 ) allows more - detailed characterization of fat composition , compared with a h spectrum .
perhaps the most significant observation was that chemical shift dispersion in humans is greatly improved compared with 1.5 t or 3.0 t. the ability to resolve protons adjacent to double bonds allows noninvasive estimation of the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue .
in addition to composition analysis , the well - resolved resonances of human tibial bone marrow and calf subcutaneous fat at 7 t could also be very useful as an internal standard to quantify intramuscular lipids ( 26 ) , which have attracted great research interest over the last few years , owing to their relation to insulin sensitivity , diabetes , and obesity ( 27 ) . in conclusion
