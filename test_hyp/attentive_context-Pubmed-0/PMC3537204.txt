the current study was performed to evaluate carotid imt in diabetic pregnant women with gestational diabetes and to ascertain if an impaired oral glucose challenge test ( ogct ) correlates with the development of increased imt .
nevertheless , the trend of the increase in pregnant women with gestational diabetes is still unclear . in our study , with the aid of carotid ultrasound , arterial examination was performed at mid - term and full - term pregnancy and both controls and the women with an impaired ogct test were assessed and compared with regard to the changes in carotid imt .
an overall comparison between the impaired ogct test group and the control group via the mann - whitney u test revealed significant differences in carotid imt in the midterm and full - term pregnancy ( table 2 ) .
even with this small study , we were able to find an increased imt after diabetes appearance , which might be used as an indicator of a potential increased vascular risk .
in conclusion , an impaired ogct test is proven to be an independent risk factor for increased carotid imt and subsequent coronary artery disease .
an increased carotid imt can be observed not only in long - standing type ii diabetic but also in newly detected type ii diabetic patients . especially in pregnant women , carotid imt gradually increases from the first to the third trimester of normal pregnancy and regresses in the postpartum period .
