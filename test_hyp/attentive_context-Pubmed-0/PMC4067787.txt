kindler syndrome ( ks ) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis , which was first described in a 14-year - old girl in 1954 by kindler and later by forman et al . in 1989 .
dental findings had been briefly reported for kindler patients in dermatologic and pediatric publications including oral lesions , atrophy of buccal mucosa , limited oral opening , malocclusion , dystrophic teeth , ankyloglossia , bleeding gums , lip erosions and geographic tongue , atrophy of gingiva , erosion of the hard palate , gingival swelling and desquamative gingivitis .
the syndrome is a combination of features of inherited blistering skin disorders ( e.g. , dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ) and congenital poikilodermas ( e.g. , rothmund - thompson syndrome ) and should be differentiated due to clinical overlap with hereditary acrokeratotic poikiloderma ( hap ) and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa .
a 16-year - old female patient presented with the chief complaint of bleeding gums , ulcerations of buccal mucosa , missing teeth and difficulty in swallowing .
patients usually have a normal life span , but significant morbidity may be caused by secondary infections of congenital blisters ; mucosal involvement leading to urethral , anal and esophageal stenosis ; aggressive periodontitis , and ocular complications .
