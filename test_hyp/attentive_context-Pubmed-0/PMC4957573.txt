the microarray data and the  piano  computational approach here presented , have allowed to the identification of significant pro - survival processes , otherwise hidden , regulated by pka in glucose deprivation . a part from our approach , these data could be further used to uncover other mechanisms of cancer resistance mediated by pka , whose role in cancer progression has assumed great relevance in recent years , , .
such a representation provides a clear and concise comparison of the regulation of pathways in the two contrasts , highlighting common regulation of pathways in normal and transformed cells , like  ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes 
, down - regulated in both nf / n and tf / t , and specific pathway regulations , different for the two cell lines , like the up - regulation of pathway  steroid biosynthesis  detected in tf / t but not in nf / n .
