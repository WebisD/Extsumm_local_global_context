we present the case of a large pp causing acute limb ischaemia to a 37-year - old man .
an otherwise healthy 37-year - old man presented with acute limb ischaemia of recent onset .
popliteal pseudoaneurysms ( pps ) account for < 4% of all popliteal artery aneurysms , and hence experience of their management in individual centres is limited   .
this case report demonstrates the efficiency of stenting in the acute management popliteal artery pseudoaneurysms with encouraging early radiological and clinical outcomes .
the diagnosis of pp may also be delayed due to long - time interval between the initial trauma and symptom onset .
trauma to the popliteal arteries resulting in pseudoaneurysm formation is rarely encountered outside the setting of wartime surgery   .
pps are a clinical entity that is rarely encountered in civilian medicine , and account for < 4% of all aneurysms of the popliteal artery   .
thus , the endovascular treatment offered in this case was efficient in dealing with both the acute ischaemia secondary to thrombosis as well as the aneurysm itself in the short term .
a ct angiogram was subsequently undertaken to establish the morphology of the aneurysm for preoperative planning , which confirmed the diagnosis but also demonstrated a large number of pellets in the soft tissues surrounding the right knee in keeping with the history of previous gunshot injury to the area .
