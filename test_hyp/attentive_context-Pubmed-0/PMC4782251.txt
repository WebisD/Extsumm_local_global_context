this study aims to investigate os in patients with ovarian cancer related to the changes in sm mass and body composition arising during neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
mean smi at baseline was significantly lower in the group of patients who could increase sm , and low baseline smi was present in 70% of these patients compared with 41% of patients who experienced muscle loss during chemotherapy ( p  =  0.003 ) .
in this manuscript , we have provided evidence that loss of sm and loss of vat during neoadjuvant chemotherapy is detrimental to os for ovarian cancer patients .
a retrospective study was performed including patients with advanced ovarian cancer ( figo 2013 stage iibiv ) who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to interval debulking in the maastricht university medical centre ( maastricht , the netherlands ) between january 2000 and june 2014 .
loss of sm and loss of vat were also significant in the multivariable model and influenced os negatively with hr 's of 1.77 and 1.83 , respectively .
perioperative malnutrition has also been associated with higher rates of suboptimal debulking surgery and thus a shorter survival in a study of older women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.26 in addition , muscle loss by itself is associated with poor physical function , increased chemotherapy toxicity , and longer recovery after surgery.27 , 28 , 29 finally , the presence of comorbidities and old age could also be detrimental .
