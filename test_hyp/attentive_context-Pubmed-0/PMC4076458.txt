aortic valve stenosis ( as ) is a common valvular disease in the western world .
more studies , however , are needed to explore a multiplicity of aspects of this treatment especially in very old patients .
medical innovations such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( tavi ) have emerged as a new treatment option which improves the clinical course of as without high surgical risk .
improvements in devices , technical expertise , and clinical experience , along with perioperative patient management may expand the use of tavi for elderly patients at lower surgical risk in the future .
many older adults with severe as are not candidates for savr because of high surgical risk , advanced age , frailty , or comorbidity conditions .
surgical aortic valve replacement ( savr ) has produced significant results that have been well documented for elderly patients , including improved life expectancy , cardiovascular symptoms , and quality of life .
, it is important , though , to realize that age , per se , is not a predictor of poor outcomes of surgery , and those patients usually enjoy the same survival rates within their age and gender matched population . to help bridge this gap in care ,
