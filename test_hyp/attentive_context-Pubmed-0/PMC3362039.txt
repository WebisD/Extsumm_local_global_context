this is a typical example of the commonalities between different neurodegenerative diseases and highlights how research into one area is likely to benefit in others .
alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is a form of dementia affecting 26.6 million people worldwide as of 2006 ; a figure predicted to quadruple by 2050 .
the most well - regarded theories as to the pathology underlying the degeneration of neurons in the brain are the formation of extracellular senile plaques ( sps ) via amyloid - beta ( a ) deposition   and formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) via hyperphosphorylation of tau protein .
noninvasively detecting labelled a plaques with pet imaging is , it is a far cry from the ability to detect changes in single neurons as is now possible in the eye   . historically , the visual symptoms that have long been reported in ad patients ( see later ) have been attributed to neuronal damage to the visual pathways in the brain rather than the retina   ; however , there is increasing evidence that the specific pathological findings in the brain occur in the retina also , both in ad patients and transgenic ad animal models .
