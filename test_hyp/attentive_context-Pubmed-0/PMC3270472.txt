we explore this species in relation to various environmental factors in amaraj , pernambuco , an area of intermingled atlantic forest and farmland that is of particular interest as regards high acl transmission   .
the purpose of this study is to analyze the  behavior  in terms of distribution and population trends through time and across space of lutzomyia species in a long - term focus of acl transmission in the state of pernambuco , brazil . given that l. whitmani dominates the sandfly fauna in this region almost absolutely , we focus on this species , as it clearly drives much of the dynamics of the system .
there was a negative association between this species and higher ndvi values ( denser vegetation ) , and predictions of the distribution of l. whitmani among regsions were statistically significantly better than random expectations .
this tie of l. whitmani to human - altered environments has been noted also in amazon basin , and in the center - west and southern parts of the country   .
relating patterns of occurrence to patterns of surface reflectance in the landsat imagery , the jackknife process indicated ndvi from october and april as the environmental variables most associated with presence of l. whitmani .
