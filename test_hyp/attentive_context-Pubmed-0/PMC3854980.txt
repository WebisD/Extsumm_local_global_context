we present a case of a 27-year - old male with significant disruption to his anterior abdominal wall with associated thoracoabdominal injuries who was managed operatively .
traumatic abdominal wall hernia ( tawh ) has been defined as  herniation through disrupted musculature and fascia associated with adequate trauma , without skin penetration , and no evidence of a prior hernia defect at the site of injury .
some reports advocate a conservative approach with operative intervention at a later stage if indicated , whereas others have promoted immediate surgical intervention .
a 27-year - old male with no past medical history was the driver and sole occupant of a car which crashed through a fence at 80 kph and hit a lamp post .
the potential for contamination , high rates of wound infection and the need to place mesh adjacent to recently herniated bowel raises a debate between the merits of synthetic and biologic meshes . abdominal wall repair with both absorbable and non - absorbable synthetic meshes in the presence of contamination has led to high rates of mesh infection , fistulation and even death .
a recent systematic review has demonstrated that cross - linked biologic meshes can be used with low rates of hernia recurrence and few complications .
