individuals diagnosed with 46xy dsd show an overlap in clinical and biochemical parameters which emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation with a multidisciplinary approach .
this is an ambispective study where all new and old follow - up patients diagnosed with 46xy dsd , being managed at endocrine opd in a period of 16 months ( june 2014october 2015 ) were included .
on first evaluation , 11 patients had presented with the primary complaint of ambiguous genitalia , three ( who were being reared as female ) with primary amenorrhea , three with undescended gonads and one with fever and vomiting .
phenotype varies depending on the degree of genetic , hormonal and anatomic defect . at times , in spite of all the tests a definitive diagnosis may not be possible .
sexual development in males is a multistep process , implying a delicate network of molecular events that directs the bipotential gonad to differentiate into testis ( sex determination ) and consequent differentiation of internal and external genitalia in the presence of testicular hormones ( sex differentiation ) .
the diagnosis of 46xy dsd needs to be confirmed by cytogenetic , hormonal , radiological , and genetic tests .
