, we set out to evaluate the clinical and criminal characteristics of epileptic patients who committed violent crimes .
further studies comparing epilepsy patients with and without violent behavior may increase our understanding of the relationship between epilepsy and aggression .
in this national center - based retrospective study , the most common epilepsy subtype in patients with violent crimes was localization - related epilepsy , and these patients showed favorable responses to medical treatment . it was noted that violent crimes were rarely observed during ictal or postictal periods , suggesting that neuropsychological and social factors might interplay and lead to violence rather than the violence being caused by just the epileptic seizure itself .
low intelligence , alcohol abuse , and psychosis appear to be associated with criminal activity among epilepsy patients .
our study suggested that a low level of intelligence was related to an earlier onset of crimes .
when patients are admitted to the hospital , we perform routine blood tests , electroencephalography ( eeg ) , and the korean version of the wechsler adult intelligence scale , which measures the intelligent quotient ( iq ) .
the mean age of the patients at epilepsy onset and at the time of their first crime was 15.5  14.5 years and 33.9  12.3 years , respectively .
