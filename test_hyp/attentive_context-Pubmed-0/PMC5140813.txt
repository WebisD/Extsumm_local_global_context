in addition , we aimed to 
 clarify the difference between the therapeutic effect of traction therapy and that of 
 decompression therapy , and their clinical therapeutic significance by comparing low back 
 pain disability index between the two intervention groups .
the activity of the erector spinal muscle decreased significantly in comparison 
 with the changes in both groups ( p<0.05 and p<0.01 , respectively ; table 3table 3.comparison of changes in muscle activity and disk height within and between the

moreover , trunk muscle activities were 
 measured by using surface electromyography ( semg ) , and the lumbar pain disability index was 
 calculated by using the odi and then analyzed and compared between the groups .
fifteen subjects were randomly selected for the experimental group and 
 received decompression therapy and trunk stabilization exercise .
in addition , trunk muscle activities were measured by using semg , and lumbar pain 
 disability index was calculated by using the odi questionnaire and then analyzed and 
 compared between the groups .
the disk herniation index in the 
 experimental group decreased significantly ( p<0.01 ) in comparison with the changes in 
 both groups .
