this observation is particularly relevant , as the brain is an exquisite target of mitochondrial dysfunction , and progressive encephalopathy is the most frequent clinical presentation of mitochondrial disease in infancy and childhood .
the nad pool is set by the balance between de novo and  salvage biosynthetic pathways and utilization by nad - consuming enzymes .
we have shown here that these treatments can correct the biochemical and clinical phenotype of the sco2 mouse , a model of genetically determined mitochondrial disease . increased transcription of genes related to both oxphos and mtupr
nr is a natural vitamin with no known adverse effects , which could be administered as a dietary supplement , particularly in case of isolated mitochondrial myopathy .
primary mitochondrial disorders due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) are a well - established cause of severe disability and precocious death in both children and adults ( koopman et  al . , 2012 ) .
our work supports the idea that the increase of nad levels in critical tissues is an effective therapeutic option for mitochondrial disease .
while homozygous knockout individuals are embryonic lethal , the sco2 mice show a predominantly myopathic phenotype characterized by  exercise intolerance and associated with ubiquitous cox deficiency .
