we examined whether 
 the hese program promotes functional improvement of the paretic lower extremity of stroke 
 patients .
further study of more methods for improving stable gait 
 through hip flexor muscle power strengthening movements is required , with larger numbers of 
 participants , a longer treatment period , and a follow - up after the treatment .
significantly improved after the hese program ( p<0.05 )
