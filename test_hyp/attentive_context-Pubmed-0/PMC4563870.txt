our finding of a homozygous p.ala100ser variant in tgds in our patient supports that this is a common mutation in catel  manzke syndrome , and his phenotypic presentation underlies the severe respiratory and growth complications that can occur in association with pierre robin sequence in this disorder .
catel  manzke syndrome ( mim : 616145 ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by pierre robin sequence with hyperphalangy and clinodactyly of the index finger , .
, we describe an additional patient with molecularly confirmed catel  manzke syndrome who has pierre robin sequence ( without cleft palate ) and manzke dysostosis , and we compare his phenotype with the phenotype of the seven previously described patients with pathogenic variants in tgds 
 .
to date , this report is only the second publication describing molecularly confirmed catel  manzke syndrome , and our patient is only the eighth reported patient . we compared our patient 's features with the features of the seven previously reported patients in the original manuscript describing pathogenic variants in tgds as the cause for catel  manzke syndrome ( table 1 ) , , , .
the seven unrelated patients reported , c.298 g  >  t ( p.ala100ser ) was the most common pathogenic variant and was hypothesized to be a founder mutation .
