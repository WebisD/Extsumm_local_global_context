within the first two years , cneupro confirmed sapp , various a peptide variants , gfap , s100b , and ubiquitin as biomarker candidates known from previous studies . additionally , further app fragments were discovered and tdp-43 as well as -glucocerebrosidase and erk 1/2 were proposed as potential novel candidate biomarkers for the early and differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases ( table 1 ) . because of the high complexity of the blood proteome and probably because of its distance from brain pathology , novel biomarkers in serum or plasma are still elusive . to promote biomarkers in support of the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders in europe , cneupro devised european standard operating procedures for preanalytical sample handling and established a neurochemical dementia diagnosis reference center in hungary .
cneupro has now started to select the most promising biomarker candidates from two proteomic studies within cneupro and to reassess the most promising biomarker candidates with larger sample size and independent methods to finally integrate them into novel prototype assays . to increase the accuracy of a biomarker - based diagnosis , biomarkers in body - fluids
the eu - project clinical proteomics for neurodegenerative diseases ( cneupro ) is not only dedicated to the detection of potential new biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative diseases in csf and blood , but also to the implementation of in - depth reassessments and validation studies .
