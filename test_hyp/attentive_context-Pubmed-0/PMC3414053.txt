our study tested conceptually relevant phenotypes that to date had not been explored in this way inanyother exercise research . given that the physiological response to aerobic exercise involves a complex interplay of metabolic , cardiovascular , musculoskeletal , ventilator , and hormonal functions , these genes and snps are likely to explain only a small portion of the variability in individual differences in response to aerobic exercise .
thus , each of these snps was investigated in the current study in order to determine potential relationships with phenotypes related to physiological and affective response to an acute bout of aerobic exercise .
the present study replicated prior findings suggesting that snps in the creb1 , fto , oprm1 , slit2 , and fam5c genes are all related to phenotypes encompassing various responses to exercise .
one strength of this study was its focus on a sedentary population , a group that has been rarely tested in terms of associations between genetics and exercise phenotypes .
moreover , giving feedback to sedentary individuals regarding the genetic basis for their strengths and weaknesses in fitness / exercise / sports activities could be a potentially useful motivational tool for increasing exercise behavior   . in sum , expanding our understanding of the association between genetics and exercise response phenotypes has a myriad of implications for helping to increase exercise behavior in sedentary individuals , an outcome which is crucially important for the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with cancer .
