the aim of our study was to characterize a148 t polymorphism of cdkn2a gene in bladder cancer patients .
the obtained frequencies were compared with the control group from the polish population , examined by debniak and colleagues , and a significant difference was found in the prevalence of a148 t polymorphism in the bladder cancer group ( g test , table 2 2 : nbladder cancer = 156 , ncontrol = 1210 , g = 4.298 , p < 0.05 ) .
studies on genetic predispositions to neoplasm development allow to distinguish the group of subjects with an increased risk for neoplastic changes vs. the general population .
t alleles , either in the bladder cancer group or in the reference control group .
( 2005 ) , it does not imply that a148 t polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of the diseases alone but it rather suggests the existence of some interactive modifiers that , when grouped together , may trigger the malignancy process .
frequencies of cdkn2a variants in controls and in the bladder cancer group results of electrophoresis ( msscp ) of cdkn2a gene exon 2 and of sequentioning of particular codon 148 variants .
