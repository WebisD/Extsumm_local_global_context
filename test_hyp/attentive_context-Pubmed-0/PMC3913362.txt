the prevalence of morbid ( i.e. , grades 2 and 3 ) obesity was still increasing from 2005 to 2010 , but its growth rate had slowed down as indicated in the behavioral risk factor surveillance system ( brfss ) . given the large disease burden of obesity and its high prevalence , it is crucial to continuously monitor the prevalence of obesity in the us .
concurrent evidence on the leveling off of the obesity epidemic in the us is thin and the trend is unclear and inconclusive at this time . given the high prevalence of obesity and its profound socioeconomic consequences , close monitoring of the trend is warranted .
this study estimates the obesity prevalence among us adults aged 20 years and older in 2011 - 2012 and tracks its trends from 1999 to 2012 . the main advantage of nhanes relative to other national health surveillance systems such as the brfss and the national health interview survey ( nhis ) is the objectively measured body weight and height , which eliminates self - report bias .
moreover , nhanes is a probability sample of the us civilian , noninstitutionalized population , excluding inmates of institutions ( e.g. , people in penal / mental facilities or homes for the aged , or on active duty in the armed forces ) .
