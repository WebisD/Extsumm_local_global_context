intracranial meningiomas offer one such opportunity and , on account of their comprising almost one - fifth of all intracranial tumors , warrant the development of an outcome instrument with a narrower scope .
with qol assessment becoming increasingly important as an information , education and outcomes assessment tool for both physicians and patients , relying on an outcome instrument too general in scope may leave more detailed , but nonetheless pertinent , issues unexplored and unmeasured . while fact - br has been validated as an assessment tool pertaining to brain tumors in general , those tumors which associated with characteristic site - specific signs and symptoms readily lend themselves towards qol assessment with an even further refined scope .
outcomes and quality of life ( qol ) assessment instruments are important for assessing the results of surgical and radiosurgical treatment , as well as comparing results across studies .
further examination of fact - mng should revolve around qualifying its validity as compared to the outcome assessment provided by other qol instruments ( most notably fact - br ) following meningioma surgical therapy .
currently , the instrument most accurately targeted at assessing qol following brain tumor resection is the validated functional assessment of cancer therapy - brain ( fact - br )   .
