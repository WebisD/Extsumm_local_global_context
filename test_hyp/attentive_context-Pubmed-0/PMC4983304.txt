therefore , the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of adding an additional layer of hydrophobic resin on the repair shear bond strength of a silorane - based composite resin with the use of two silorane - based and methacrylate - based composite resins .
however , the use of en extra layer of hydrophobic resin is useful in the repair of silorane - based composite resin with a methacrylate - based composite and can increase the repair bond strength .
considering the limitations of the current study and the results achieved , it can be concluded that use of an extra layer of a methacrylate - based hydrophobic resin does not influence the repair bond strength during repair of a silorane - based composite with a silorane - based composite .
evaluation of the modes of fracture of different groups led to the conclusion that the majority of failures were of adhesive type in the group in which an extra hydrophobic layer had been used and the repair composite resin was silorane - based .
streomicroscope images of fracture patterns ( 20 ) which are classified as : a : cohesive in the repairing composite resin , b : cohesive in the repaired composite resin , c : adhesive , and d : mixed
