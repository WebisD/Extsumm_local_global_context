in addition , we aimed at examining potential predictive factors of sdb in ms patients with fatigue .
nevertheless , we believe that our study provides an additional piece of clinical experience to the current discussion on the role of sdb in ms patients with fatigue . in conclusion , our study confirms that sdb and fatigue are associated features in ms and that sdb treatment leads to a small yet statistically significant reduction of fatigue
  considering the increasing interest in sdb as a potential risk factor for fatigue in ms , the primary goal of this prospective investigation  so far the largest respirography study on sdb in ms  was to understand whether routine overnight respirography should be done in all ms patients with severe fatigue .
the main purpose was to elucidate whether routine respirography can be recommended as a screening method in ms patients with severe fatigue and whether long - term cpap therapy leads to a clinically meaningful improvement of fatigue .
although the observed sdb frequency was rather high , our study was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sdb in ms or to compare its prevalence between ms patients with and without fatigue , as we did not perform respirography in ms patients with fss scores < 5.0 and did not include a control group
