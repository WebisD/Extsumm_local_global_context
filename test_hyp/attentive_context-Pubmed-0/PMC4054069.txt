this article describes an alternative technique for the customization of cad / cam frameworks through a dual - scan process .
a 46-year - old woman , presented with a carious lesion under a metal onlay restoration on tooth number 16 requesting an esthetic restoration .
it allows for the individualization of the substructures in a predictable manner and possibly improves longevity of all - ceramic crowns since core and porcelain thicknesses can be controlled .
this procedure provides adequate porcelain support and thickness in a predictable manner with little additional effort and cost to both clinicians and laboratories .
this technique needs to be further studied in a controlled clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of substructure modification .
the advent of computer - aided design / computer - aided manufacturing ( cad / cam ) technology allowed the possibility of working with high strength polycrystalline materials , shifting the problem to the veneering ceramics .
this way , the use of glass - ceramic ingots for pressing veneering ceramics onto zirconia frameworks was proposed to reduce the prevalence of veneer chippings / fractures .
this seems reasonable since the veneering ceramics present lower flexural strength ( 90 - 120 mpa ) compared with the yttria - stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycristals substructure ( 900 - 1200 mpa ) .
