this article describes two patients with mbc who had hormone - refractory disease and who were candidates for single - agent chemotherapy . in both patients , eribulin mesylate ( halaven , eisai inc ) , a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor , was administered .
it is estimated that there will be > 234,000 new cases and 41,000 deaths from breast cancer in the united states in 2015 , with 6% of women with breast cancer having metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.1,2 for patients who progress to metastatic disease , the 5-year survival rate is 25%.1 data are unclear as to how many women progress to metastatic disease following diagnosis and treatment of a primary tumor .
a recent retrospective study of women with metastatic breast cancer ( mbc ) found that 33% were her2-positive and 71% were hormone receptor - positive ; 19% of patients in a recent phase iii trial were both hormone receptor - negative and her2-negative , a status often referred to as triple - negative disease.5,6 patients with her2-positive and/or hormone receptor - positive disease have improved survival due to recent novel therapy options , whereas survival rates remain poor for patients with triple - negative mbc.5,7 as a result , there is a dire need to find novel treatments to manage patients with mbc , including those with triple - negative disease .
