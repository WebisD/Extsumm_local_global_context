it supports a multifaceted effect of sglt-2 inhibitors , beyond inhibition of co - transporter in proximal renal tubule and proposes that these drugs will be able to shift the body milieu from maladaptive anabolism in type 2 diabetes to adaptive metabolism .
inclusion of plasma glucagon values or portal glucagon concentrations , in formulae or models created to measure insulin sensitivity , may improve their utility .
the igr should also be studied as a tool for research and clinical decision - making .
group suggest that this paradoxical response is a manifestation of an adaptive physiological response to loss of calories in the urine .
the inclusion of the alpha cell in de fronzo 's infamous ominous octet , coupled with advancement in therapeutics such as glucagon receptor antagonists , and bihormonal bionic ( two hormone ) artificial pancreas devices , has brought glucagon back to the center stage of diabetes research .
the sodium - glucose cotransporter-2 ( sglt-2 ) inhibitors are a novel class of glucose - lowering drugs which act by inhibiting the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the kidneys .
there is , however , an associated rise in endogenous glucose production , noted both after acute and chronic administration of sglt-2 inhibitor , which attenuates the glucose - lowering efficacy of the drug .
