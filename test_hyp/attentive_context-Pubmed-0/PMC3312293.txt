, we describe the results of a study of the effects of atelocollagen on intercellular sealing function .
while we were studying the basic properties of atelocollagen , we discovered another of its functions : it increases endothelial permeability . here
we measured transendothelial electrical residence ( ter ) in order to estimate intercellular barrier function and performed an immunohistochemical examination to see whether any cellular morphological changes were induced .
in addition , the changes observed in this study are similar to those triggered by thrombin , histamine , tnf-   , and vegf ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , and so forth . as shown in section 3.1 , the degree to which endothelial function was affected was dependent on the molecular structure of the oligonucleotides including their size and chemical modifications , suggesting that the three - dimensional structure of the oligonucleotide and atelocollagen complex stimulates a signal transduction pathway that acts as a permeability modulator , although the specific pathway that it stimulates remains unknown . to date , no severe systemic edema or side effects of the ac formulation
the unique biological functions of atelocollagen have led to the development of unique antitumor therapies and products , such as surgical products ; formulations that sustain the release of antitumor proteins   ; treatments that enhance the antitumor activities of various molecules including antisense odn   , sirna   , and mirna   . obtaining more information about atelocollagen
