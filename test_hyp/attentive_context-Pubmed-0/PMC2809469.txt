 suspicion of a 
 central cause for vertigo on examination should prompt urgent imaging of the 
 central nervous system.a vertical nystagmus should give high index of suspicion for a central 
 cause.central vestibular lesions may present with a wide variety of symptoms and signs which

a sixty - four - year - old lady presented to her general practitioner 
 ( gp ) with acute onset of unsteadiness and dizziness associated with movement .
a presentation to hospital with vertigo or dizziness is common   .
suspicion of a 
 central cause for vertigo on examination should prompt urgent imaging of the 
 central nervous system .
central vestibular lesions may present with a wide variety of symptoms and signs which 
 may include impaired vor , head titubation and tremor , opsoclonus , and oscillopsia .
as a presentation to otolaryngology , the history of this case is not 
 unusual .
we discuss the close interplay of pathophysiology relating to vertigo , 
 nystagmus , oscillopsia , and the vestibulo - ocular reflex and its modulation by 
 head titubation .
otolaryngologists have expertise 
 in this area ; however , patients may be more appropriately referred to neurologists 
 or general physicians in the first instance .
