the unexpectedly low long - term efficacy on exacerbation rate from roflumilast therapy made the r&d community re - examine the role of targeting pde4 in copd because one of the highest unmet needs in treating the disease is to reduce or eliminate exacerbations ( pharmiweb 2005 ) . in november of 2005
targeting type 4 phosphodiesterase ( pde4 ) has been recognized as a promising approach to managing copd by relieving the symptoms , slowing the progress of the disease , increasing exercise tolerance , reducing exacerbation rate , and improving quality of life ( giembycz 2001 , 2005 ; mehats et al 2003 ; spina 2003 , 2004 ; lagente et al 2005 ; lipworth 2005 ; soto and hanania 2005 ) the pressing need to develop drugs that control symptoms and reduce mortality ( pauwels et al 2001 ; gold 2005 ) and the billion - dollar marketing potential for management of copd have pushed the r&d of pde4 inhibitors into the product development pipelines of major pharmaceutical companies in the recent years .
the unsatisfied efficacy of using pde4 inhibitor roflumilast in treatment of severe and very severe copd has raised concerns in the r&d community about the administrative approvability for the highly expected novel therapeutic modality in combating copd .
