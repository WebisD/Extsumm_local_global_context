thus , a growing body of evidence suggests a role of mir-378a as a mediator controlling reciprocally dependent processes such as metabolism , muscle differentiation / regeneration , and angiogenesis .
as mir-378a was found to be differentially regulated in different types of cancers and its level is changed in serum of prostate , renal , and gastric cancer patients , it can be considered as a biomarker for those diseases . the correlation between mir-378a expression and disease progression in lung cancer , liver cancer , and rhabdomyosarcoma suggests a further role of this microrna as a prognostic marker .
a growing body of evidence suggests a role for mir-378a as a mediator controlling reciprocally dependent processes in metabolism , muscle differentiation / regeneration , and angiogenesis .
if more research will be done to the mechanisms of action , possibilities for therapeutic use of mir-378a could be sought in the field of metabolic disorders , obesity , or tumors .
cell metabolism governing the growth and functioning of each cell and a whole organism refers to chemical transformations and enzyme - catalyzed energy producing and energy utilizing reactions of carbohydrates , proteins , and lipids . amongst the most metabolically active organs are liver , brain , gut , kidneys , and heart   .
