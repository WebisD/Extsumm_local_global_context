the objectives of this study were ( 1 ) to explore the potentially distinct trajectories of physical activity from childhood to adulthood , ( 2 ) to examine whether physical activity was associated with cross - sectional , short - term , and long - term changes in depressive symptoms in adulthood , and ( 3 ) to examine whether the physical activity trajectories contributed to depressive symptoms in adulthood to a greater degree than adulthood physical activity .
this study examined whether distinct trajectories of lifelong physical activity existed in the data and whether physical activity was related to depressive symptoms in adulthood .
the associations between physical activity and depressive symptoms disappeared when the preexisting symptoms of depression were controlled for , indicating that physical activities did not associate with the progression of depressive symptoms .
thus , the study suggests that lifelong physical activity history does not contribute to the progression of the depressive symptoms to a greater degree than adulthood physical activity .
high physical activity associated with lower level of depressive symptoms in adulthood , which is in accord with previous research   .
this inspection was important , because the information whether lifelong trajectories contribute to depressive symptoms over and above the concurrent ( adulthood ) physical activity is lacking .
