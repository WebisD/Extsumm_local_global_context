the major aim of the present study was to obtaine growth curve and doubeling time for enscs , then to investigate the ability of enscs to differentiate in vitro toward adipocyte in the presence of adipogenic - promoting media .
in the our previous study , we have shown enscs can differentiate to neural and adipocyte cells and we used oilred o staining for illustration of adipocyte differentiation ( 24 ) . in this study we assayed ppara specific marker for adipocyte with rt - pcr .
morphology of cultured enscs ; a : morphology of freshly isolated ens cells ; b : fibroblast - like morphology of enscs after 2 weeks cell culture ; c : clonal population of enscs after plating in 24 well plate 1 week after cloning ; d : the same population 2 weeks after cloning .
the adipogenic differentiation was demonstrated by cellular morphology , oil red o staining and rt - pcr for ppara .
these data support the possibility of wider applications of enscs in cell therapy of soft tissue defects that result from deep burns and tumor resections and congenital defects .
we have shown that after 12 days of induction , small lipid droplets appeared within enscs treated with differentiation medium , and the size of the lipid droplets increased at 21 days pt . besides the morphological evidence
