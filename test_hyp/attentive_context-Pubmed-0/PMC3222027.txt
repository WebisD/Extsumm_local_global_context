recently , a single center study conducted by oiva and coworkers and published in critical care   demonstrated that phospho - specific whole blood flow cytometry could be used to assess activated signaling path - ways in leukocytes isolated from pancreatitis patients .
pancreatitis is an inflammatory process in which pancreatic enzymes are activated leading to autodigestion of the pancreas and adjacent tissues . during pernicious cases ,
rapid results from whole blood phospho - specific flow cytometry during pancreatitis will allow for immune status determination , likely improve early diagnosis and provide a rational basis for immune targeting therapies .
the initial inflammatory response is excessive and can result in tissue injury , organ failure , and death . to counter this inflammation ,
although therapy aimed at blunting the initial over - exuberant inflammation may be beneficial if applied early , it may also be detrimental by impairing the host 's ability to fight infection that is a common cause of death in these patients . to complicate the potential use of immune - modulating therapy ,
although beyond the scope of the report , a potentially necessary step after immune status determination , and prior to treatment with inflammatory altering treatments , would be to first treat the whole blood cells isolated from the patients with the potential therapeutic agent and evaluate the immune effector cell response .
