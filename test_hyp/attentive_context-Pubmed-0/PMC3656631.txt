jean - martin charcot used handwriting samples to aid in differentiation of essential tremor ( et ) and parkinson s disease ( pd ) , with et demonstrating tremulous handwriting and pd demonstrating bradykinesia.1 today s clinician may be confronted with cases on the borderzone of et and pd as some symptoms may overlap .
pd rest tremor has been shown to be alternating on short term recordings in multiple studies.3 long term tremor monitoring of et and pd tremor without differentiating rest vs. postural tremor by spieker et al6 revealed a more variable pattern in both disorders , with alternating tremor still dominating in pd and having a 78% predictive value for pd vs. et.6 in a series of 15 patients with et and 15 patients with pd , nistic et al7 showed that all et patients had synchronous rest tremor while all pd patients had alternating rest tremor on short term recordings.7 to our knowledge , synchronicity characteristics of re - emergent tremor in pd have not been previously evaluated .
other clinical findings that may help with pd diagnosis include bradykinesia with fatigable or decrementing amplitude , facial hypomimia , and decreased arm swing , but rarely even their presence is not fully consistent with idiopathic pd.8 patients with clinical diagnosis of pd who have normal nuclear imaging are termed subjects without evidence of dopaminergic deficit ( swedds)8 and their tremor is thought to be due to dystonic tremor.9
