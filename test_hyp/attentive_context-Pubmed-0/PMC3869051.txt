we used male , mouse , spleenic cd4 t cells , differentiated in vitro to t helper ( th1 ) cells to produce a population of cells ( > 95% cd4 ) , of which 69% have 2n genome content , reflecting mature cell withdrawal from the cell cycle .
deep sequencing of the single cell hi - c libraries demonstrated that following stringent filtering our current scheme allows recovery of up to 2.5% of this theoretical potential , and has identified at least 1000 distinct hi - c pairings in half ( 37/74 ) of the cells .
deep sequencing confirmed saturation of the libraries complexity , and allowed elimination of spurious flow cell read pairings and additional biases ( extended data tables 1 - 3 ) .
ensemble  hi - c protocol to create a method to determine the contacts in an individual nucleus ( fig . 1a , supplementary information ) .
visualization of the single cell maps suggested that despite their inherent sparseness , they clearly reflect hallmarks of chromosomal organization , including frequent cis - contacts along the matrix diagonal and notably , highly clustered trans - chromosomal contacts between specific chromosomes ( fig .
