the aim of this study was to assess changes , if any , in morbidly obese patients treated with bpd - ds and rygbp , from baseline , that is , before surgery , to followups 1 year and 3 years after surgery , with regard to platelet counts and serum concentrations of ggt and alt .
a significant reduction in platelets , a marker for inflammation and fibrosis in nafld , was observed in both groups after 1 year but only in bpd - ds over time , which may indicate improvements in general inflammatory status and particularly steatohepatitis .
data from the bpd - ds group were compared to that of a morbidly obese group ( n = 21 ; three men and eighteen women ) , all free from established diabetes and had undergone rygbp .
patients were investigated preoperatively ( baseline ) and then 1 year ( 1st followup ) and 3 years ( 2nd followup ) after bpd - ds and rygbp , respectively .
the main findings in this study were that liver enzymes , ggt and alt , markedly decreased over time after both rygbp and bpd - ds surgeries , but platelet counts only decreased significantly after bpd - ds .
