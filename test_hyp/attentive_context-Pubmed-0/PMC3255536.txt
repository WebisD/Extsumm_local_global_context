hence , it is axiomatic that rare diseases , in addition to being coruscating curiosities , also serve as windows to the world s normal order . among the women and men who address human mutations , clinicians provide care for those affected with rare maladies , and a special cadre of scientists investigates the causes of those disorders .
only a union of clinical and basic researchers  and an awareness of the rich resource that lies in the population of rare disease patients  can achieve this .
many specific cases warranted intense investigation , based on their compelling clinical presentations , the likelihood that the basic defects would be uncovered and the impact predicted to emanate from the  new disease discovery. in the sections below , we recount examples that illustrate the process of disease discovery and how it can , in turn , provide new information about the role of genes and biological pathways in normal and impaired physiology .
the udp filters thousands of enquiries down to hundreds of nih clinical center inpatient admissions , and then chooses illustrative cases to pursue experimentally .
the nih undiagnosed diseases program ( udp ) , announced may 19 , 2008 , serves as a focal point for the synergistic interplay between clinical and basic science investigators ( gahl and tifft , 2011 ; gahl et al . , 2011 ) .
