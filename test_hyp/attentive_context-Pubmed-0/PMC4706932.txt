the above data , especially the known apoptotic effect of heparin on pmnls   , led us to hypothesize that priming of pmnls renders them more susceptible to the apoptotic effects of heparin and that apoptosis induced by heparin is mediated in part by heparin interactions with cd11b , which is highly expressed on the surface of primed pmnls . in order to test our hypothesis , we used pmnls isolated from hemodialysis ( hd ) patients as a model of in vivo primed cells   and pmnls isolated from healthy controls ( nc ) primed ex vivo with paf .
moreover , heparin causes a significant dose - dependent decrease in the rate of superoxide release from pmnls , blocking primed cells from further activation , partially explaining the anti - inflammatory effects of heparin .
our results indicate that primed pmnls , regardless of their priming origin ( ex vivo or in vivo ) , are more susceptible to the apoptotic effect of heparin compared to nonprimed pmnls . we also show that heparin binds to cd11b , leading to apoptosis that can be blocked with neutralizing antibodies against cd11b .
it has been previously reported that heparin induces apoptosis in a dose - dependent manner in nc pmnls . in the present study , 30  min incubation with heparin enhanced apoptosis in separated human pmnls in a dose - dependent fashion , however to a much greater extent in primed paf - stimulated nc and hd pmnls . in nc pmnls ,
