the aim of this study is to select a method for a better extraction of bht from the leaves of the halophyte plant mesembryanthemum crystallinum .
the leaves of the halophyte plant mesembryanthemum crystallinum were collected from their natural biotope in the two periods june 2007 and december 2008 ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
more useful explanation for the decrease is ascribed to the enzyme polyphenol oxidase , which degrades polyphenols in water extracts whereas in methanol and ethanol they are inactive . in conclusion ,
bht spectra were detected at 280  nm by analytical hplc ( figure 2 ) ; the different spectra were compared between the plant growth stage and the bht standard ( 10  mg / ml ) . the results ( figure 3 ) , by using method 1 of extraction showed that the seedlings stage has the highest antiradical activity ( 65,24    0,27 ) . 

the concentration of bht was determined in g / ml / g of fresh leaves ( figure 1 ) .
the results showed that mesembryanthemum crystallinum extract at seeds stage has the highest bht concentration . at this period ,
figure 4 showed the comparison of antiradical activity between the two methods ( method 1 and 2 ) . at the same plant growth stage ( floraison ) , the extraction by method 1 has higher antiradical activity ( 51  0,82 ) in comparison with method 2 ( 32,33    2,05 ) .
