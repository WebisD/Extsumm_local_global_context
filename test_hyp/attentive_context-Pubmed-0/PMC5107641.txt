, we describe our experience with a case of rapid progressive culture - negative ie in an immunocompetent man , which was caused by s. agalactiae , based on the results from 16s ribosomal rna ( 16s rrna ) gene sequencing using the resected valve .
one of the most common causes of blood culture - negative endocarditis is the administration of antimicrobial agents before performing the blood cultures . in this report
a 43-year - old previously healthy japanese man presented with a 3-week history of a high - grade fever (  >  39  c ) , rigor , and lumbago .
streptococcus agalactiae ( s. agalactiae ) is also known as group b streptococcus ( gbs ) , and causes invasive disease in neonates and pregnant women .
the increasing incidence of prgbs with elevated -lactam mics may make it increasingly difficult to select an appropriate antimicrobial treatment for gbs endocarditis .
therefore , although s. agalactiae is a rare cause of rapid progressive ie , it should be considered as a potentially causative pathogen , even among non - pregnant immunocompetent adults .
identification of the causative pathogen is essential for the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of ie , although blood culture - negative endocarditis accounts for 2.531% of all cases of endocarditis .
