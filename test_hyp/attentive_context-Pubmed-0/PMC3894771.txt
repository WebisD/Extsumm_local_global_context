the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different light sources , pd 
 curing protocols and storage media on sorption , solubility and biaxial flexural strength 
 ( bfs ) of a composite resin .
within the limitations of this in vitro study methodology , it was 
 concluded that , in general , the light sources ( qth and led ) and curing modes ( cm and pd ) 
 did not influence the sorption , solubility or bfs of the tested resin .
however , in 
 the interaction between permeant and light source with a density of 16 j / cm , 
 it was seen that the specimens light - cured with the led unit device in pd10s and stored 
 in ethanol led to higher values of sorption and solubility than those light - cured with 
 qth ( p<0.05 ) .
the null hypotheses tested were : ( 1 ) qth and led curing 
 light units using different energy densities produce no influence on sorption , 
 solubility and bfs ; ( 2 ) qth and led curing light units using different curing techniques 
 produce no influence on sorption , solubility and bfs ; ( 3 ) storage procedure in water and 
 ethanol produces no influence on sorption , solubility and bfs .
