conventional mri findings in foreign body granuloma patients may sometimes mimic those of brain tumors . to differentiate the diagnoses , the performing a perfusion mri and mr
a 35-year - old woman was admitted complaining of a headache over the last two months .
although the perfusion mri and mr spectroscopic findings are not specific for foreign body granulomas , these techniques may be helpful in excluding a high - grade tumor diagnosis , which may be the most important differential diagnosis . by combining clinical history of any previous operation , conventional mr imaging findings , and perfusion mri and mr spectroscopy , it may be possible to correctly diagnose a foreign body granuloma . in summary ,
this diagnosis was based on the strong enhancement of the mass accompanied with severe peritumoral edema and a mass effect .
the chemical agents used in neurosurgery to achieve intra - operative hemostasis can cause foreign body reactions .
this was true of our patient based on the mr imaging findings showing intense mass enhancement with severe surrounding edema . however ,
the mass was surgically removed and the pathology revealed a foreign body - associated granulomatous inflammation with marked lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration , microcalcification , and fibrous scar tissue formation ( fig . 1j , k ) . following surgery ,
