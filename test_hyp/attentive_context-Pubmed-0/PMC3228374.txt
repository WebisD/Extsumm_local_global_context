the aim of the presentation is to give insight into clinical and selected pathological characteristics ( tumor size and aggressiveness , multicentricity , and locoregional spread ) of the disease in pediatric age , assess their role in cancer risk , and identify possible critical parameters for developing metastatic disease .
modified radical neck dissection is obligatory part of surgery , in the same act as total thyroidectomy , keeping in mind that neck lymphonodes are primary sites of locoregional recurrence . with meticulous attention to technical aspects of surgery
this study is a retrospective analysis of data from 16 pediatric patients with papillary thyroid cancer , ages from 1018 .
we support the need for total thyroidectomy and meticulous intraoperative exploration of the thyroid bed and lateral neck , with surgical extirpation of all potential microscopic disease foci . for positive regional metastatic disease , standard paratracheal and/or
overall , no age differences were found for pathological aggressiveness ( p = 0.19 ) and multicentricity ( p = 0.89 ) even though younger group had significantly wider aggressiveness ( 34% versus 16% ) .
we had two cases of temporary early postoperative hypocalcaemia , which were successfully controlled by calcium carbonate and rocaltrol p. o. there was one case of permanent hypocalcaemia ( recurrent case ) .
