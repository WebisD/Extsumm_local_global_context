recently 
 we reported on an analysis of the infrared spectrum of 
 c2f4 . by observation 
 of many combination and difference bands , including many from two c - containing isotopologues , and by comparison with mp2 and 
 density - functional calculations , all 12 fundamentals could be assigned , 
 although only five are ir active .
the 
 magnitude of x18 as compared to the much 
 smaller x17 ( coupling cc stretch with 
 cis pyramidalization ) also supports a valence - bond analysis of weak 
 double bonds , which was reviewed in ref ( 19 ) .
very recently , 
 high - level theoretical studies investigated 
 electronic ground and excited states of c2f4 and their dependence on some coordinates , mainly 
 to discover the fate of this molecule after electronic excitation 
 and make comparisons with a corresponding time - resolved experiment 
 ( ref ( 16 ) ) . for the 
 ground state , the stabilizing effect of pyramidalization in the twisted 
 molecule was confirmed .
this idea is supported in the present work 
 by the large value found for the anharmonic constant x18 coupling cc stretch with trans pyramidalization .
the transition state for 
 s0 dissociation was said to result from avoided crossing 
 of the 2ag and 1ag ( i.e. , s0 ) states , 
 also with large one - sided pyramidalization but at longer cc distances 
 and perhaps without twist
