acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , m3 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) is characterized in the majority of cases by proliferation of neoplastic hypergranlar promyelocytes and blast .
we report a case of apl- hypogranular variant that poses particular diagnostic challenge because of its atypical morphology .
a 30-year - old male presented with severe anemia , bilateral subconjunctival haemorrhage and petechial skin rashes .
this case report emphasizes the importance of a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia , the hypogranular variant in particular .
acute promyelocytic leukemia : fish technique shows chromosomal translocation , t(15;17 ) . in view of the atypical blasts morphology , a provisional diagnosis of hypogranular variant of aml - m3v was suggested .
the biological and clinical heterogenicity of apl is based on the clinical presentation of the disease and various characteristics of leukemic cells at diagnosis .
the patient was immediately started on all trans - retinoic acid ( atra ) and cytarabine and is progressing well after 12 months of follow up period .
molecular cytogenetic analysis by fluorescent in situ hybridization ( fish ) was used to investigate chromosomal abnormalities associated with the leukemic process and found out to be translocation of chromosome 15 and 17 , i.e. , t(15;17 ) ( figure 3 ) .
