a 45-year - old man with a lifelong history of atopic dermatitis had a year - long unremitting exacerbation for which he had started systemic therapy .
this patient was markedly ill on admission and had a distinctive varioliform eruption with lesions in a uniform stage of evolution .
although not performed in this case , we recommend such testing if a simultaneous infection with an orthopoxvirus can not be ruled out .
prolonged hypothermia is associated with severe illness ( 7 ) and is equivalent to fever in determining critical illness ( 8) , which we believe satisfies cdc s first major criterion .
tzanck preparation promptly confirmed herpetic etiology , but we nevertheless used cdc s algorithm for evaluating agvpri , and our patient s illness stratified to high risk .
the third criterion requires the same stage for most cutaneous lesions on an affected area .
dfa for hsv and vzv is relatively rapid , but in our case , the dfa result was positive for vzv , although viral culture and immunohistochemical staining later showed that the patient s infection was due to hsv-2 .
although our patient s illness eventually met the fever criterion , his 101f temperature occurred only after he began antiviral treatment .
