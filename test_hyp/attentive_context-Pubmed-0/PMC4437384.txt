the present study constitutes a novel proof - of - concept for the detection and monitoring of melanoma in urine and feces samples of mice at an early stage .
our model was able to distinguish between melanoma bearing mice and healthy mice with sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 100% , as compared to studies of other groups on human samples ( e.g. , 70% sensitivity and 90% specificity reported by   and 89% sensitivity and 90% specificity reported by ) .
in addition , to correlate more precisely between tumor size and voc concentration one should collect samples more often ( every 24 days ) and correlate the biomarkers to tumor volume as measured with a caliper . a different way of measuring is by expressing gfp or luciferase in the b16 cells and following their volume with an imaging device such as mri . despite the differences between mouse and human metabolism , possible biomarker candidates found in mice urine and feces
our urine statistical model correctly predicted eight out of the 9 mice bearing an  early - melanoma ,  indicating that mice at that stage can be detected and distinguished from healthy mice and from mice bearing a  late melanoma .  while other research groups   focused on comparing human melanoma to normal and nevus skin biopsies , we attempted to distinguish between mice with an early - melanoma and healthy mice .
