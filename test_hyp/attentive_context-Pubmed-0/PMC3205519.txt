imaging is increasingly important in the diagnosis and management of appendicitis , avoiding unnecessary interventions and delay in treatment that may lead to perforation .
acute appendicitis is the most common diagnosis suspected in patients presenting in emergency rooms with acute abdominal pain , and is the most common indication for an urgent abdominal intervention .
both delayed and unnecessary interventions may lead to adverse fetus outcomes.  a mean negative appendectomy rate of 26% ( 1647% ) have been reported when the diagnosis is based only on clinical and laboratory findings , dropping to 610% when imaging is performed . therefore , the use of imaging modalities is critical to confirm the diagnosis , when facing a clinical suspicion of appendicitis . currently , there is no uniform protocol regarding the use of imaging tests , with some centers starting with ultrasound ( us ) and others with computed tomography ( ct ) , according to their availability and local experience .
clinical guidelines defining the use of each particular imaging modality allow uniformity , a targeted approach for different patient populations , and cost - effectiveness of medical services .
hence , there is a need for guidelines regarding the optimal patient - tailored imaging modality to begin with , and an algorithm for determining further imaging procedures .
