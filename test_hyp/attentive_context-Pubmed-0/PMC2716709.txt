we found that mapk fus3 mediates rapid negative feedback that aligns the dose - responses of upstream and downstream system activities in the pheromone response system . we propose that dose - response alignment improves information transmission through this and other signaling systems .
haploid saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells use a prototypic , g - protein coupled - receptor / map kinase cascade signaling system , the pheromone response system 1 , to sense and transmit information about the concentration of mating pheromone secreted by cells of the opposite mating type ( fig .
furthermore , we found that fus3 negatively regulates a novel signal - promoting function of the rgs protein sst2 .
for example , consider a drug that increased sensitivity of cells to a naturally occurring antagonist of cell proliferation , analogous to the downstream dose - response shift we observed upon fus3 inhibition in the pheromone response system ( fig .
our results demonstrate that rgs proteins , present in many eukaryotic signaling systems ( the human rgs family , for example , contains more than 35 members 32 ) , can function in signal transduction systems by increasing signal in addition to accelerating g - protein inactivation , possibly ( as in the case of pheromone response ) by facilitating recruitment of mapk scaffolds to sites of activity .
