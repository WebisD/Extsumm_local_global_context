pearson ccs for all latency parameters were greater than 0.80 with the exception of median nerve mean fwl ( cc = 0.69 ) .
standard deviation of the difference between test and retest results would have been 0.31 , 1.04 , and 0.34 .
further studies with longer test - retest intervals and a higher subject count would be valuable in confirming the high reproducibility of ncs parameters measured in this study . extending the study to pathologic nerves and validating the equivalent or superior performance of automated ncs instrument should increase the adoption rate of the automated ncs technology in patient management
for example , the cc values for ulnar nerve dml , mean fwl , and dsl without temperature correction were 0.72 , 0.93 , and 0.72 , respectively .
potential sources of variation include the use of different emg instruments at different test sessions or sites , inconsistent placement of recording and stimulating electrodes , use of non - standardized distance measurements , use of sub - maximal electrical stimuli , poor skin preparation resulting in high skin impedance , and failure to maintain limb temperature within an acceptable range or to compensate for temperature .
