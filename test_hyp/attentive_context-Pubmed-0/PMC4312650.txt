our analysis showed that cancer directed surgery and radiation therapy were significantly less likely to be offered to api compared to nhw . despite this , compared to nhw , api had increased disease - specific survival for early stage ( i and ii ) and stage iv nsclc .
our primary objective was to utilize an established large nationwide cancer registry to ascertain racial / ethnic disparities in nsclc clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes .
however both ais and non - ais diagnoses ( with the exception of stage ii , hr : 0.966 , p > 0.05 ) were both associated with improved survival compared to the referent squamous and transitional diagnosis , with ais being the more favorable diagnosis ( table 2 ) .
previous retrospective analyses have shown api to have decreased mortality compared to nhw for stage i disease , with an overall survival advantage regardless of smoking status which is consistent with our results   .
patients with stage ii diagnosed at age 7079 ( hazard ratio [ hr ] : 4.077 , p < 0.05 ) and > 80 ( hr : 5.14 ,
, api as a group had better overall survival after nsclc diagnosis compared to nhw , and single marital status was associated with decreased survival in the api population , which is consistent with our results .
