the described beneficial effects of hyperbaric treatment on the one hand , and its potential proinflammatory effect on the other hand , the aim of this study was to estimate effects of hyperbaric treatment by determination of cd15s and cd11b leukocyte proinflammatory markers as well as cd77 and cd34 expression on rat renal , pulmonary and cardiac cells .
, we also speculate that positive effects of hyperbaric oxygenation on renal dysfunction in sepsis caused by e. coli are mediated by the decreased percentage of cd77 + cells .
our result of increased percentage of cd34 + pulmonary cells after hyperbaric treatment support the hypothesis that endothelial progenitor cells play a very important role in lung growth in physiological and many pathophysiological conditions . for
the percentages of cd77 positive and cd77 negative endothelial ( cd34 + ) cells , of cd77 positive non - endothelial cells ( cd34- ) , of total cd77 positive and of total cd34 positive cells in suspensions of total cardiac cells of control rats and rats that went hyperbaric treatment .
our study showed that percentage of cd77+cd34 + rat renal cells in the group exposed to hyperbaric treatment was significantly lower than in the control group , as well as the percentage of total cd77 + cells .
