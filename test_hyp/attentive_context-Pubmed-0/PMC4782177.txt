we derived 
 the two networks and identified protein - specific hub genes and gene 
 modules , showing the unique contribution of proteomic data to breast 
 cancer research .
after testing 
 the performance of our algorithm on several in silico experiments 
 and comparing jrf with different methods including genie3 the joint graphical lasso ( jgl ) , we applied jrf for the simultaneous construction 
 of gene coexpression networks and protein coexpression networks . for 
 our analysis , we considered gene expression from tcga and protein 
 expression from cptac data for 62 breast cancer patients .
we propose jrf ( joint 
 random forest ) , a new algorithm for the simultaneous 
 estimation of protein coexpression and gene coexpression networks . 

because in this 
 study we were mainly interested in assessing the unique contribution 
 of proteomic data to breast cancer research , we focused our attention 
 on protein - specific hub genes and modules .
this 
 motivates us to perform joint learning of both rna - seq and proteomic 
 networks , so we are able to borrow information across different data 
 sets and better capture the common correlation structure , which shall 
 then improve the overall accuracy of network estimation .
, we will refer to the 
 coexpression networks constructed by jrf from global proteomics data 
 and rnaseq data as protein - network and rna - network . at fdr cutoff 
 of 0.001
