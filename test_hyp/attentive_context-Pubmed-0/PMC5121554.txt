clinicians must ensure that patients who are previously well and present recurrently with chest infections are fully investigated and that they consider the possibility of a lesion causing gastric outlet obstruction .
a 49-year - old nigerian female presented to her local hospital with a 1-year history of recurrent chest infections .
clinicians should consider dedicated abdominal imaging , and if a mass is identified , undergo endoscopy to further characterise the lesion and develop an on - going management plan with appropriate specialist input .
the index of suspicion should of course be higher if the patient goes on to further develop signs of an obstructing lesion , such as persistent vomiting .
surgical resection has the advantage of lower recurrence rates as opposed to endoscopic resection ; however , with the obvious caveat of a much higher risk of morbidity and mortality . in this article , we present a case where a female patient developed recurrent chest infections and gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an intussuscepting ampullary adenoma . due to the size and location of the mass ,
it was surgically removed by pancreaticoduodenectomy . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first such presentation worldwide , and we hope that it may be of educational value to both physicians and surgeons alike .
