are spring - summer spawning fish , that typically spawn april to june , broodstock management was conducted by controlling the light cycle in an indoor tank using the characteristics of spring - summer spawning , during which the spawning behavior , spawning induction , and spawning frequency were examined .
in this study , the yellowtail kingfish broodstock were caught in the wild , and bred to a length of 85.0103.0 cm ( mean 97.8  7.0 cm ) in an indoor tank , meaning that , in contrast to the study of gonadal development in yellowtail kingfish off the coast of northern new zealand , the females should have exceeded the length at which they first started reaching maturity , while the males would have reached 100% maturity .
this study therefore aimed to develop a method for the production of stable , healthy fertilized eggs from yellowtail kingfish . since yellowtail kingfish
in this study , the size of the tank was 100 m. the fish acquired in march 2008 grew from in mass from a mean of 4.5  0.7 kg to 11.4  1.3 kg in 77 months , while the fish acquired in october 2012 grew from 2.6  0.9 kg to 8.0  1.1 kg in 22 months . by adjusting the light cycle , we were able to induce spawning and retrieve fertilized eggs . in determining the size of broodstock management tanks for seriola spp .
