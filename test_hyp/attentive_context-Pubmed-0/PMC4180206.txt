despite the noted limitations , this study extends prior research on the moderators and mediators of the social stressor - drinking outcome relationships to broaden notions of coping to include politically oriented coping .
  , we model coping as a mediator of the relationship between the stressor ( i.e. , stressful consequences of the great recession ) and the stress response ( i.e. , drinking outcomes ) .
future studies incorporating this mode of coping may more clearly elucidate the political dynamics involved in both the macrolevel production of social stressors and the deleterious alcohol - related consequences of these stressors .
this line of research would also have implications for the treatment of alcohol - related problems .
in particular , considerations of more adaptive modes of coping might go beyond recommending individual behaviors such as job seeking by unemployed individuals to also suggest politically oriented coping to collectively try to influence the social conditions such as unemployment levels that may give rise to the propensity to self - medicate distress through the use of alcohol .
for example , parents of autistic children have lobbied governments for social services perceived to aid in their children 's development . in sum , ( 1 ) collective coping tactics ( such as politically oriented coping ) represent an unmeasured dimension of coping behaviors beyond that represented in the coping literature to date and ( 2 ) collective coping tactics may demonstrate a stronger association between stressors , particularly those stemming from macrolevel social forces , and deleterious drinking outcomes compared to the use of modes of coping previously emphasized in the literature on coping .
