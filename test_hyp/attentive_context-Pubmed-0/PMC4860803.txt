the aim of this study , therefore , was to examine the effect of comorbidity on survival outcomes , in particular cancer- and noncancer - specific survival rates , after surgery in patients with solid cancers .
patients with multiple comorbidities ( especially cci scores of > 2 ) were most vulnerable to both cancer- and noncancer - specific deaths within the first 6 months after cancer surgery .
accordingly , our study identified that patients with increasing cci scores were associated with a greater postoperative mortality risk , including increased overall , cancer- , and noncancer - specific mortality rates .
overall mortality rates of patients with cci scores of 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 - 8 were 22.9% , 29.5% , 38.2% , 43.2% , 50.2% , and 56.4% , respectively ( figure 1 ) .
most importantly , our study also demonstrated that patients with multiple comorbidities ( especially cci scores of > 2 ) were most vulnerable to noncancer - related deaths within the first 6 months after cancer surgery .
however , surgery can result in substantial morbidity and mortality in cancer patients , especially in those who are medically unfit or frail to begin with 18 - 22 .
