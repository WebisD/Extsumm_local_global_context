while drugs can cause acute rhabdomyolysis individually , they can also interact with other drugs by cytochrome p450 and p - glycoprotein mechanisms to bring on the syndrome.clinicians should evaluate drug interactions in patients taking two or more medications .
the fda recommends that clinicians check cyp - mediated potential drug interactions routinely . in this case report , a case of diclofenac- and pantoprazole - induced ar is evaluated for drug - interaction mechanisms , and different perspectives are presented . while evaluating the patients with side effects of drugs ,
the cyp and p - gp mechanisms that play roles in drug absorption and distribution should be considered .
1etiology of acute rhabdomyolysis and its complications etiology of acute rhabdomyolysis and its complications a comprehensive study was carried out in 2011 using 20042009 data of the us food and drug administration ( fda ) to reveal which drugs may be associated with rhabdomyloysis .
acute rhabdomyolysis ( ar ) is a clinical syndrome that occurs when the electrolytes and myoglobin that are released upon skeletal muscle damage enter into the circulation system .
the gastric side effects of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are well known , and their concomitant or subsequent combination with proton pump inhibitors is common . a review of adverse drug reactions , creatinine kinase elevations , and muscle events , including muscle weakness , myopathy , myositis , and polymyositis , analyzed such multiple drug regimens and found that the addition of pantoprazole to a treatment regimen was the cause of all muscle events , aside from myalgia .
