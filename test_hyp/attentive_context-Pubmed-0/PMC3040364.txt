we present a case of a patient with bs who developed fsgs and subsequently underwent renal transplantation due to aggravation of his renal function .
we also review previously reported cases of both diseases and cases of individuals with bs who underwent renal transplantation .
bartter syndrome ( bs ) is a rare inherited renal tubular disorder characterized by renal salt wasting , hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and normotensive hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism1 , 2 ) . although bs is a typical tubular disorder ,
transplantation was successful and bs disappeared completely after transplantation as shown in our patient . in summary , bs may be complicated by fsgs due to adaptive response to chronic salt - losing nephropathy , and fsgs may cause esrd in some patients .
case reports of patients with bs who underwent renal transplantation are also rare , and the causes of esrd include progression of fsgs or other causes including complication of long - term non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug treatment6 , 12 - 15 ) . in one of the patients , pre - emptive bilateral native nephrectomies and renal transplantation were conducted prior to the onset of esrd due to severe , clinically brittle , neonatal bs15 ) . in all of the cases ,
