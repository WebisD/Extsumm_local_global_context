the ndi value for the rh group was 1.81 and 1.39 before and after irradiation , respectively .
table 2 shows that the frequency of mn cells significantly increased in both rh and rh irradiated ( 2gy ) samples whereas the percentage of binucleated , trinucleated , and tetranucleated cells decreased after irradiation .
the present study suggested that chromosomal radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in normal individuals with rh factor is higher than their rh counterparts .
given the variation in radiosensitivity in the normal population - this study aimed to evaluate chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes in normal individuals with rh and rh factors .
the results indicated that the average mn is significantly higher in rh than in rh in the irradiated group ( p<0.001 ) ( table 1 ) .
as table 1 shows , the mean values of mn in binucleated cells were 196  18.23 and 169  17.11 for rh and rh samples , respectively ( table 1 ) .
for the rh type , the parameter declined from 1.85 to 1.40 following gamma irradiation . regarding the ndi in table 2 ,
approximately 20% of the radiotherapy patients showed a wide range of normal tissue reactions ( 23 ) . recognizing patients with high , moderate , or low radiosensitivity would help develop a good plan for the radiotherapy of patients with the highest cure rate in terms of the patient s individual adaptation ( 10 ) .
