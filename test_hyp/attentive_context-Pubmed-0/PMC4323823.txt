the dasi , a selfassessment tool of functional capacity , provides strong independent and incremental prognostic value for longterm adverse clinical events that is comparable to cardiac biomarkers in stable cardiac patients undergoing coronary evaluation .
subgroup analysis of duke activity status index ( dasi ) scores and future risk of major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) according to standard cardiac biomarkers
the ability to determine functional capacity has relied on subjective assessment based on direct patient interviews during the history and physical examination and objectively by quantifying measures identified from standardized exercise testing . standardized instruments to assess functional capacity and/or health status have been developed , but their clinical adoption has been challenged by both logistical hurdles and an emphasis on  hard  clinical end points in the determination of treatment responses . remarkably , few studies have undertaken the prospective validation of the functional capacity measures in the prediction of future major adverse cardiac outcomes beyond allcause mortality alone or direct comparisons with clinically available biomarkers . here , we sought to determine the prognostic value of estimating functional capacity using a simple selfadministered assessment tool in a contemporary stable cardiac patient population .
in fact , the predictive value of dasi score in predicting future mace ( auc : 0.67 [ 95% ci 0.66 to 0.69 ] ) appears to be comparable with commonly used prognostic cardiac biomarkers such as bnp ( auc : 0.68 [ 95% ci 0.66 to 0.70 ] or hscrp ( auc : 0.61 [ 95% ci 0.59 to 0.64 ] ) . when hscrp , bnp , and estimated glomerular filtration rate were all added to the multivariate model that included traditional risk factors , lower dasi score ( quartile 4 versus quartile 1 ) still demonstrated a significant 2fold increased risk in future mace at 3 years ( adjusted hr 2.00 , 95% ci 1.55 to 2.58 , p<0.01 ) .
