pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) is a progressive disease that can cause right ventricular ( rv ) dilatation and dysfunction as a result of increased pulmonary vascular resistance ( pvr ) and pulmonary arterial ( pa ) pressure.1)2 ) echocardiographic evidence of rv systolic dysfunction and clinical features of right - sided heart failure have been regarded as the main determinants of morbidity and mortality in patients with pah.3)4)5 ) despite the obvious clinical importance of assessing rv systolic function , the estimation of rv function can be challenging.6)7 ) because of their invasiveness and/or high - cost , right heart catheterization ( rhc ) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cmr ) are impractical for frequent serial assessment .
decrease of mpap and pvr as a result of treatment was associated with improvement of rvls .
the increase of rvls corresponds with the decrease of mpap and pvr with specific pulmonary vasodilator therapy .
thus , we compared rvls with functional capacity and invasive hemodynamic data by rhc in patients with primary pah .
rvlsglobal had significant correlations with hemodynamic parameters including mpap ( r=0.35 , p<0.05 ) , cardiac index ( r=0.50 , p<0.01 , and pvr ( r=-0.45 , p=0.01 , fig .
