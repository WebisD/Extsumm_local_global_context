this project was developed 
 for the second semester of a two - semester , two - credit introductory 
 organic chemistry laboratory course sequence for chemistry and related 
 majors ; the project was first implemented in spring 2012 and successfully 
 improved for spring 2013 .
a research module has 
 been developed and successfully implemented 
 in a second - semester introductory organic teaching laboratory for 
 chemistry majors .
the module exposed 
 students to modern chemistry through the use of microwaves and fluorous 
 techniques , and engaged them in the process of organic chemistry as 
 practiced in many laboratories across the world .
key features of the approach were an outlined route 
 to a target that necessarily forced students to think critically about 
 the procedures they planned to use to reach the targeted molecule 
 and to propose modifications to known procedures .
the 
 project described is , to the best of our knowledge , the first reported 
 implementation of fluorous synthesis and solid - phase extraction chemistry 
 in the undergraduate organic teaching laboratory . in preliminary development , ways were sought to attach 
 a fluorous tag to fluorescein derivatives ; 
 a recent fluorescein experiment from this journal has already been successfully adopted in this course . after encountering difficulty
