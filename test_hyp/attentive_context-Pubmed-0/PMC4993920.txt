based on the common use of tetracyclines in food animal production and the absence of confirmatory methods for the presence of the four tetracyclines in animal feed , the aim of this work is to present an hplc - ms / ms method for the analysis of tetracyclines in nonmedicated feed samples at levels of g / kg .
results showed the presence of tetracyclines in 15% of the samples , indicating that cross contamination occurs and maximum levels for tetracyclines may be required in the future .
the limit of detection ( lod ) and limit of quantification ( loq ) of the method were calculated and verified with feed samples spiked with the tetracyclines at different concentrations .
the research work presents a simple and fast method for the analysis of the four tetracyclines regulated in the production of food of animal origin ( chlortetracycline , doxycycline , oxytetracycline , and tetracycline ) .
cc and cc were higher than lod and loq for all the compounds , meaning that tetracyclines detected at a higher level than the cc will be positive and levels of tetracyclines were quantifiable , without doubt .
based on s / n above 3 for lod and above 10 for loq in matrix - matched samples , the lod and loq of the method were set at 35 and 47  g / kg for chlortetracycline , 40 and 60  g / kg for oxytetracycline , 24 and 40  g / kg for tetracycline , and 100 and 150  g / kg for doxycycline .
