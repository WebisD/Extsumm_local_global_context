children delivered by c - section were 1.41 times as likely to develop t1 dm ( hazard ratio ( hr ) 1.41 , p = 0.015 ) . in the second model , which included size - for - gestational - age
this study identified c - section as a significant risk factor for the development of t1 dm among children aged 015 years in nl , a region with very high rates of t1 dm .
, c - section delivery was not associated with increased risk of t1 dm ( hr 1.3 , p = 0.076 ) . both parity and size - for - gestational - age
findings of this study indicate that c - section delivery was a significant risk factor for t1 dm in children aged 015 years .
t1 dm was more common among first or second born cases compared to those born third or higher ( p = 0.022 ) . 

this finding is in line with a recent meta - analysis of 20 studies which found that the combined effect of c - section delivery was 1.23 ( 95% ci 1.151.32 ) .
conversely , a matched case - control study of 196 cases in the united kingdom   found that mothers of control children were older than mothers of cases ( or = 0.900 95% ci 0.854 , 0.948 ; p < 0.001 )
