we tried to highlight the possibility of a balloon - only treatment of a restenosed bioresorbable scaffold . with an adequate initial lesion preparation
a 65-year - old female patient presented in january 2013 with unstable angina . coronary angiography showed a severely calcified long lesion of the proximal and mid segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery [ video s1 ( please see enhanced content link on title page ) ] . in view of the angiographic findings
, this strategy can be even applied in severely calcified coronary lesions . finally , given the limited data , there is a need for further examination of the place of ra before brs implantation and the optimal treatment strategy for in - scaffold restenosis from future rcts .
this loss of radial force is suspected to be source of recoil when balloon dilatation is performed alone after 6  months . in this patient ,
the vessel wall 10  months after brs implantation opposed minimal recoil to the scoring / deb treatment , which achieved sufficient stable lumen size and remained effective until 2  years of follow - up . in our case
a coronary angiography done 10  months later due to recurrent angina revealed a significant restenosis of the implanted brs .
