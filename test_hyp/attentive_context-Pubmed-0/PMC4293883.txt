the use of an immunodiagnostic test , the elisa , led to the diagnosis of the earliest case of human schistosomiasis ( s. haematobium ) which occurred more than 5000  years ago in an egyptian adolescent .
he reported that schistosomiasis was highly prevalent in both the nile delta and the nile valley south of cairo in districts where the perennial irrigation system was used .
the highest prevalence was recorded in the northern and eastern parts of the delta where 85% of the population was infected with either one or both species of the parasite . on the other hand ,
although it is well documented that schistosomiasis haematobium was endemic in ancient egypt , yet the first detailed study describing its pattern of prevalence was carried out in 1937 by scott .
. the great success in controlling schistosomiasis in egypt is achieved through the implementation of several control programs which adopted the same strategy recommended by the who .
, there was a consistent reduction in the prevalence of s. haematobium infection except in sohag , qena and aswan following the construction of the high dam where basin irrigation was converted to perennial irrigation system . at present , the ministry of health and population records indicate that by the end of 2010 only 20 villages in the whole country showed prevalence more than 3.5% and none had more than 10%
