the objective of this study is to compare the laparoscopy with laparotomy for the treatment of pic with respect to various demographic , perioperative and postoperative parameters .
there were a significantly shorter mean length of hospital stay , less estimated blood loss and a lesser difference between the preoperative and the one day postoperative hemoglobin level in the laparoscopic group compared to that of the laparotomic group ( p=0.037 , p=0.047 and p=0.040 , respectively ) .
laparoscopy by well - skilled surgeons may decrease the mean operative time , the rate of conversion to laparotomy and the surgical complication . in conclusion ,
the outcome was assessed according to the operative time , the estimated blood loss , the serum ca-125 level , the number of septations of the cyst , the difference of hemoglobin between pre - operation and the one day post - operation , the length of hospital stay , the perioperative and postoperative complications , and recurrence of pic .
laparoscopic surgery is a safe , effective and reliable method for the treatments of pic .
our study showed that laparoscopy was superior to laparotomy for the mean estimated blood loss , the mean difference of hemoglobin , the mean length of hospital stay , and the complication rate .
