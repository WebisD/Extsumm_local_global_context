molecular and cell biological studies on cryptococcus bisexual mating have led to the discovery of the essential roles of the pheromone sensing mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway in sexual reproduction .
cryptococcus is a human fungal pathogen that is responsible for the majority of fungal meningitis cases in immunocompromised and immunosuppressed people   .
neoformans cell size is not an important factor in determining mitochondrial inheritance and there is still a lack of convincing evidence to support the hypothesis regarding selective degradation of the mat mitochondria .
for example , the oxidative theory for mammalian mitochondrial inheritance is unable to explain why there is uniparental mitochondrial inheritance even during in vitro fertilization where the oxidative damage to sperm cell is nominal . in case of mammals , both size differences during gametogenesis and ubiquitin tagging of sperm mitochondria during spermatogenesis prior to the cell fusion event   contribute to the uniparental mitochondrial inheritance .
given that bisexual mating involves the fusion between two isogamous cells of the a and  mating types , the observation that mitochondrial dna inheritance is uniparental from the mata parent is mesmerizing   .
it is possible that no one single mechanism can fully explain the uniparental mitochondrial inheritance pattern seen in majority of eukaryotes .
