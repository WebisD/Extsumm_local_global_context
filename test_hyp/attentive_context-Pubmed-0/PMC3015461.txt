we present a summary of 571 gynecologic laparoscopies performed at yuan 's general hospital , taiwan , in 1998 and 1999 and include a discussion of advancements in the use of these procedures at this institution .
we performed a comprehensive review of all laparoscopic gynecology procedures performed at yuan 's general hospital in kaohsiung , taiwan , r.o.c . in 1998 and 1999 .
a j - p drain was inserted postoperatively in 154 of the laparoscopic hysterectomy cases ( 91 in 1998 and 63 in 1999 ) .
we believe these data support ongoing efforts to incorporate gynecologic laparoscopy as an alternative to open surgeries for treatment of appendectomy , hysterectomy , and adnexal masses at our institution .
bleeding was the most common complication , occurring in 38 of the hysterectomy cases ( 21 in 1998 and 17 in 1999 , 13.6% of the total ) , and 1 of the adnexal laparoscopies ( < 1% ) .
two patients incurred bladder injury during hysterectomy . from 1998 to 1999 , we observed a reduction in both mean surgery time ( 135.4 to 123.0 , p=0.032 ) and mean length of hospital stay ( 5.52 to 4.62 , p=0.046 ) for hysterectomies and adnexal procedures combined .
