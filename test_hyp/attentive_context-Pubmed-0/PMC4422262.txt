mrxcat is a simulation framework designed for research on cmr sampling and reconstruction strategies in the presence of motion . in order to promote comparability and reproducibility in cmr simulation research , mrxcat
the mathematical cardiac - torso ( mcat ) and the extended cardiac - torso ( xcat ) phantoms present such approaches by combining voxel - based in - vivo data with non - uniform rational b - splines ( nurbs ) or polygon meshes to define anatomical objects  .
cine and myocardial perfusion mrxcat implementations are presented alongside with reconstruction and post - processing examples as showcase applications .
in this work a cmr extension to the xcat phantom has been proposed to enable realistic simulation to aid and benchmark image reconstruction and quantitative post - processing approaches .
hybrid phantoms address the key limitations of analytical and voxel - based approaches , leading to a versatile , realistic and reproducible simulation framework .
