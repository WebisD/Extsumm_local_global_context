if one accepts the behavioral model of the factors related to the development of insomnia and its transition from to chronic or insomnia proposed by spielman and colleagues,12 a question logically arises about the optimal means of treating short - term insomnia .
studies of sublingual zolpidem thus show that this form of the drug is likely to be effective in short - term insomnia .
still , although standard 5 and 10 mg doses may be associated with morning sedation if taken after midnight,27 lower doses of sublingual zolpidem may be less likely to cause morning sedation and may thus be useful for treating short - term insomnia characterized by difficulty in initiating sleep and in motn insomnia .
an alternative might be to intervene aggressively in those with short - term insomnia in order to prevent the development of chronic insomnia .
this dosing form s rapid onset of action may confer benefits for patients taking the medication at typical bedtimes , as shown in the study by staner et al.29 standard doses may be associated with clinically significant residual daytime sedation so that standard doses may not be safely used in patients with motn insomnia . at lower doses , however , the residual daytime effects of zolpidem may be reduced and it may thus be useful in motn insomnia
