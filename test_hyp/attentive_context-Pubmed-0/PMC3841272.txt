considering the age distribution , the higher incidence of moyamoya disease was observed in adults 45 to 49 years of age and the second in children 5 to 9 years of age , their reliability would be questionable on aspect of age1 ) . given the above background , we conducted this study to examine the usefulness of the ivy sign on mr flair images as compared with single photon emission computerized tomography ( spect ) and mr perfusion studies in detecting brain hemodynamic changes between preoperatively and postoperatively in adult patients ( above 20 years ) with moyamoya disease3,12,17 ) .
as compared with conventional diagnostic modalities such as spect or mr perfusion , the ivy sign is considered as a useful indicator in detecting brain hemodynamic changes between preoperatively and postoperatively .
furthermore , the degree of ivy sign was higher in patients with a greater severity of symptoms .
to date , numerous studies have evaluated brain hemodynamic changes . since brain hemodynamic changes were first measured based on co2 reactivity in a published study , the spect has been regarded as a standard diagnostic modality where the cvr is measured based on the iatrogenic metabolic effect by using an intravenous administration of acetazolamide20,21,23 ) . in addition , the results of mtt on mr perfusion are also useful to determine the hemodynamic change in moyamoya patients12,13 ) .
