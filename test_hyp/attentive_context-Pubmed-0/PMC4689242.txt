the aim of this observational study was to investigate , in overweight patients , the possible relationship between central fat mass , liver steatosis and the circulating levels of adiponectin .
considering the only distribution of l2l5 fat tissue ( kg ) , ( mean value 5.21.2 ) , we observed that the value was higher , but reached no statistical significance , in patients with moderate and severe steatosis , compared to those with the mild type .
of all dxa parameters analyzed , those that present a statistical significant difference between the us stages of nafld were ( figure 1 ) : abdominal fat ( af , % ) , mean value 42.611.9 ( p<0.05 ) ; abdominal tissue mass ( atm : fat plus lean mass , kg ) , ( mean value 72.5 , p<0.05 ) ; abdominal fat mass ( afm , kg ) , ( mean value 3.91 , p<0.05 ) .
the assessment of ir by homa - ir , showed a statistically significant increase of insulin level , related to steatosis progression ( p<0.05 ) .
the median value of alt was 33.627.3 ul-1 , with four patients that reported high alt value , one without , two with mild and one with severe us liver steatosis .
