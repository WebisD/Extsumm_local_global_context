therefore , we investigated 
 the effects of an unstable inclined board on the active and passive ankle rom in patients 
 with ankle stiffness .
the patients were assigned randomly to two groups ( both n = 5 ) and their height and 
 weight were measured .
the active dorsiflexion angles before and after the exercises 
 were 18.2  6.4 and 22.1  5.0 in group 1 and 19.3  4.2 and 28.1  6.9 in group 2 , 
 respectively .
the amount of active and passive dorsiflexion did not differ between the two groups before 
 the exercises , with active dorsiflexion angles of 18.2  6.4 and 19.3  4.2 and passive 
 dorsiflexion angles of 23.4  5.5 and 22.6  5.7 in groups 1 and 2 , respectively ( both p 
 > 0.05 ) .
the passive dorsiflexion angles did not differ significantly between the 
 groups after the exercises ( p>0.05 ) and were 23.4  5.5 and 32.2  5.3 in group 1 and 
 22.6  5.7 and 35.1  6.0 in group 2 before and after exercising , respectively .
active ankle 
 dorsiflexion was more effectively improved with ankle stretching exercises using an unstable 
 inclined board than with exercises using a wooden inclined board .
the active 
 dorsiflexion angle was significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) in group 2 compared to that in 
 group 1 after the exercises .
