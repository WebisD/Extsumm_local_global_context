513mos nanowires with a length of 2060 m and a diameter of 60300 nm were synthesized via the double injection - hydrothermal reaction and the uniform 513mos nanowires with a length of 100200 m and a diameter of 80200 nm were formed via single injection edta - assisted hydrothermal reaction route .
the lower supersaturations of 513mos achieved in either the double injection route or in the presence of minor amount of edta , were favorable for the preferential growth of 513mos along b axis , leading to the formation of 513mos nanowires with high aspect ratios .
the increase of [ mg ] and the supersaturation of 513mos within initial 8 h of reaction should be attributed mainly to the dissolution of the mg(oh)2precursor , and the decrease of [ mg ] and the supersaturation of 513mos after 610
4c , corresponding to the trigonal part of the nanowire in fig .4a ) to the growth direction of the whiskers were 5.1 and 2.25  , quite similar to the spacing of ( 202 ) plane ( d ( 202 ) = 5.12  ) and ( 114 ) plane ( d ( 114 ) = 2.255  ) , respectively , indicating the preferential orientation of the nanowires along the   direction , which was reconfirmed by the saed analysis in fig . 4d and also identical with the xrd analysis shown in fig .
