a 61-year male presented to the emergency department with a history of road traffic accident .
the incidence of onfh is known to be high in transverse and posterior wall fractures associated with posterior dislocation6 ) . on
late complications of acetabulum fractures include heterotopic ossification and onfh , which are present in less than 10% of the population3 ) .
trauma is one of the most common causes of on , interruption of the blood supply to the affected segment of the bone being the cause of ischemia . in this case
the flow to the femoral head is potentially compromised10 ) so as to act in an accumulative stress theory , as suggested by kenzora and glimcher9 ) .
also occurs in conjunction with approximately 3% of anterior hip dislocations and in more than 13% of posterior hip dislocations . in a recent meta analysis of 3,670
surgically treated displaced acetabular fractures the incidence of onfh showed an overall incidence of 5.6%3 ) , suggesting that it is grossly overestimated and that most of the observed changes in the head of the femur are probably due to osteoarthritis5 ) .
on was diagnosed only when the radiographic findings provided a clear differentiation from wear of the femoral head2 ) . the joint pain increased due to the onfh
