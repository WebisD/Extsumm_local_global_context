this review aims to coalesce several papers across the spectrum of this research to tie together molecular pathways and illustrate emerging trends to help direct future research into cxcr4 as a prognostic and/or predictive marker for breast cancer .
a litany of studies have emerged in the last five years examining cxcr4 and axillary lymph nodes , covering multiple approaches of how cxcr4 in the setting of axillary lymph nodes can impact our understanding of breast cancer .  
lymph nodes of the axilla   have been studied in the context of breast cancer since before halsted published his study proposing that this lymphatic drainage was a pathway for metastasis and recommending axillary node dissection ( and ) .  
possibilities exist for collaboration and shared information ; the results of which could alter the current understanding and treatment of breast cancer , both local and systemic .
a clearer picture of the molecular mechanisms of lymph node metastases is the next step to designing optimal therapeutic options and to create new treatment modalities .   
understanding the true benefit for the use of and with snb has been a topic of discussion , and a recent trial has suggested that there is no advantage of and in patients with a negative snb .
