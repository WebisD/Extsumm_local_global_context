the two cases presented in this report showed that in patients with a history of severe hypertriglyceridemia and significant fat infiltration of the liver , a hepatoselective insulin ( detemir ) appeared less efficacious in achieving glycemic control .
insulin detemir has now become established as an effective basal insulin preparation and is widely used in the management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes . although it is similar in efficacy to isophane insulin , we have observed a relative lack of efficacy in two patients with significant hypertriglyceridemia and established nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , suggesting that there are circumstances where the efficacy of detemir may be adversely affected by specific metabolic parameters .
may be encountered ; a relative lack of efficacy with one type of insulin may not be seen with an alternative insulin .
it is possible that the cases described relate to less common etiologies of insulin resistance . in managing patients with diabetes , interindividual differences in response to insulin
patient 1 was a 56yearold caucasian man with a 4year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and marked hypertriglyceridemia ( random triglycerides were 28.7 mmol / l and total cholesterol was 7.9
