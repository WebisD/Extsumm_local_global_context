molecular profiling ( mp ) encompasses the testing of multiple biomarkers to evaluate the underlying genetic alterations present in a tumor at any one point in time   . to date molecular profiles may consist of multiple gene mutational analyses , gene copy number changes by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) , gene expression profiles measured by microarrays ( ma ) and protein expression by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) .
the cancer literature is replete with studies exploring single biomarkers in clinical trials designed to test single agents or biomarker analyses performed as a post hoc analysis .
although there are a plethora of biomarkers that have emerged that may positively prognosticate or predict response to various therapies , the clinical utility and adoption of this approach has been slow due to validation concerns , reproducibility and translation into clinical care   . since comprehensive mp uses a multi - dimensional approach to testing , it is inherently more complex and requires extensive validation .
this will hopefully lead to better control of cancer , improved outcomes for patients , and a more rational and less expensive oncology care .
there is significant investment in high cost , high throughput technologies , trained laboratory work force , and laboratory informatics to achieve the level of validation required by clia or cap to offer the test for patient - care .
