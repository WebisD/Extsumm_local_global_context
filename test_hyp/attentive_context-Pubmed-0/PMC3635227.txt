this paper demonstrates the use of surgical treatment using the laparoscopic approach in the palliative care of a patient with advanced esophageal cancer .
a 69-year - old male presented with progressive dysphagia , retrosternal pain and weight loss of 10 kg in 2 months .
however , surgical procedures in order to bypass the dietary route with relief of dysphagia have been reported in the literature but have fallen into disuse because of the morbidity and mortality of the procedure itself and advances in endoscopic treatment .
this report demonstrates that an update in the technique proposed by postlethwait for palliation of esophageal cancer with the use of minimal access surgery is feasible .
esophageal cancer is a devastating disease with rapidly increasing incidence in western . despite important advances in therapy ,
dysphagia from inoperable esophageal cancer is a common and complex management problem , and there is no consensus on the ideal treatment approach .
the finding was a circumferential lesion from 19 to 25 cm of the incisors , with biopsy diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma .
according to the current literature , the bypass procedure in order to palliate dysphagia could be reserved for patients in which the stent has failed or contraindicated .
