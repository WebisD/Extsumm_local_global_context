successful ldlt using a liver graft in which the lymphocytotoxic crossmatch was highly positive is reported .
renal transplantation rates are low among patients highly sensitized to human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) because of the high rate of antibody - mediated rejection and subsequent graft loss .
it was recently reported , however , that preoperative desensitization using an anti - cd 20 antibody ( rituximab ) and intravenous immunoglobulin improved transplantation rates in patients highly sensitized to hla . in contrast , the significance of a positive lymphocytotoxic crossmatch in living donor liver transplantation ( ldlt ) is controversial .
mild acute cellular rejection occurred about 3  weeks after the ldlt , but response to the steroid recycle therapy was prompt , and the lymphocytotoxic crossmatch was negative during this episode . in summary , we report a successful ldlt using a lymphocytotoxic crossmatch highly positive graft .
the recipient was a 41-year - old woman with end - stage liver disease due to alcoholic liver cirrhosis ( model for end - stage liver disease score 21 ) . at the age of 20 , she was gravida one , para one .
the impact of a lymphocytotoxic crossmatch - positive liver graft on acute cellular rejection and graft survival remains controversial , both in deceased donor liver transplantation   and in ldlt   .
