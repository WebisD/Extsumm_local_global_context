mast cells play an essential role in type i hypersensitivity ( allergic inflammation ) and also during the early stages of the innate immune response to pathogens .
disequilibrium in the function of mast cells can lead to pathological states , of which asthma is the most recognized .
so , in the last years , the study of mast cells has been redirected to investigate their participation in processes such as innate immune response to pathogens , regulation of inflammation , wound healing and regulation of tumoral growth . in this review ,
mast cells can trigger different mechanisms that contribute to the homeostasis and adequate function of the lungs .
the discovery of mice with a diminished number of mast cells , and their reconstitution with bone marrow - derived mast cells , provided a tool to test these hypotheses and to extend our knowledge about the functions of mast cells in the body .
we focus on the mechanisms used by mast cells in the lung to keep the proper function of this vital organ .
the regulation of mast cell activation by conventional drugs or microorganisms , either pathogenic or symbiotic , opens a new window of opportunities to develop new treatments that could preserve and restore lung health .
