furthermore , the 12-week treatment improved sensory ncv ( the change from baseline reached 1  m / s ) . even after an additional 48-week treatment , the improved sensory ncv was long maintained and associated with ameliorated peroneal motor ncv   . on the basis of these results , we carried out the present clinical trial to explore the effectiveness and safety of ranirestat in japanese dpn patients .
this study was a multicenter ( 20 sites in japan ) , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study in which patients with dpn were assigned to either ranirestat 20  mg / day or placebo administered after breakfast as a once - daily dose for 26 weeks .
this clinical trial has demonstrated that oral administration of ranirestat at 20  mg / day for 26 weeks , as compared with placebo , significantly improved the primary endpoint of summed sensory ncv : summed sensory ncvs in the ranirestat group increased after 12-week treatment and were significantly higher than that in the placebo group at the final evaluation ( p = 0.006 ) . in a proof - of - concept study conducted in north america , 12-week treatment with ranirestat 20  mg / day reduced the sorbitol concentration in the sural nerve by more than 80% and ameliorated sensory nerve ncv .
