recent data highlights the importance of both the innate and adaptive immune response , activation of proinflammatory cascades , and an alteration of transcriptional events in remote organs during ischemic aki .
ischemic aki initiates a cascade of proinflammatory pathways , and through the release of soluble mediators and activation of the host innate and adaptive immune systems , it facilitates organ crosstalk and remote organ injury . as our understanding of the postischemic kidney 's role in mediating organ crosstalk continues to evolve , further laboratory investigation into the remote organ response to this devastating injury
the purpose of this paper is to review emerging concepts of organ crosstalk and recent experimental data regarding the activation and systemic expression of proinflammatory pathways during ischemic aki . for a complete list of abbreviations used in this paper , please see table 1
clinical and translational laboratory studies have demonstrated the relevance of interactions between the injured kidney and distant organs , and complex mechanisms of crosstalk between injured kidneys and remote organs such as the lungs , liver , heart , gut , brain , and hematologic system have been identified .
despite advancements in renal replacement therapy , acute kidney injury ( aki ) is a frequent complication with severe implications for the critically ill patient . published mortality rates for intensive care unit patients with aki range between 30 and 70% , and aki alone remains an independent risk factor for mortality even after adjustment for demographics and severity of illness   .
