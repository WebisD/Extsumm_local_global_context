one hundred and eighty medium force 1/4-inch intermaxillary elastics ( tru - force latex 
 elastic system ; tp orthodontics inc . ,
the force degradation of 
 intermaxillary elastics , measured by tensile strength test , was observed at all periods , 
 regardless of the group ( figure 4 ) . the greatest 
 degree of force degradation occurred at the initial periods ( from t0 to t1 ) and a 
 gradual reduction of this degradation occurred at the following periods , showing a 
 tendency to reduction over time .
this was confirmed by the statistically significant 
 difference existing between t0 and t1 , t1 and t2 , t2 and t4 , t3 and t5 ( p<0.05 ) .
notice that in the first 
 moments ( from t0 to t1 ) , there was a greater reduction of the generated forces 
 ( p<0.05 ) , followed by a decrease of degradation rate in the following periods .
the chemical nature of the evaluated beverages was not able of influencing the degree of 
 degradation of intermaxillary elastics ' forces .
sequence of the experimental groups data were analyzed by one - way repeated measures anova to compare the effects of 
 intervals , beverages and the interaction between them .
