we report false homozygosity results in hla genotyping due to loh associated with the loss of whole chromosome 6 in an adult korean patient with all .
has been reported involving loh at the mhc region at the initial hla typing , which was then detected at confirmatory typing for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . here
we have described a case of false homozygosity results in hla genotyping in a patient with precursor - b all due to the loss of whole chromosome 6 in the neoplastic cells .
hla typing should not be performed with blood samples containing a high proportion of neoplastic cells , and alternative samples of buccal swab or hair follicles should be used if needed .
to avoid false hla typing results in patients with hematologic malignancies , clinicians and hla typing laboratory personnel need to be aware of the problem and take appropriate precautions .
thus the heterozygosity results of hla - a , -b , -c , -dr , and -dq loci were confirmed and finally used to search for an unrelated donor for bone marrow transplantation .
a 33-yr - old korean female was admitted to the hemato - oncology ward of seoul national university hospital on october 4 , 2010 for the evaluation of leukocytosis found during a workup for headache .
