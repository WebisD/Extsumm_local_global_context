distinct treatment strategies are required for these two diseases including surgery , radiotherapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , and immune therapy , depending on the disease type and patient characteristics such as stage of disease , aggressiveness , histological subtype , and estrogen receptor ( er)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) status . here , we report the unique case of a patient with ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) and follicular lymphoma of the breast , who also presented with second primary contralateral multifocal breast cancer at a later date .
the differential diagnosis between breast lymphoma and breast adenocarcinoma is difficult clinically and radiologically as these diseases share common characteristics , and the diagnosis is usually confirmed postoperatively .
a 55-year - old caucasian woman presented in april 2011 to the hospital with a painless lump in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast , discovered during a breast self - examination .
synchronous breast cancer and follicular lymphoma is a rare clinical condition , and has been described only a few times in the literature .
diagnosis of the two conditions in a single patient is often thought to be coincidental , but there is evidence supporting a possible pathophysiological connection involving a common genetic background or etiologic factor , or possibly , one disease causes the other . in this case , the presentation of multifocal bilateral epithelial breast cancer with three primary tumors suggests that tumorigenesis was not coincidental .
