this report highlights the importance of clinical and radiographic features in the diagnosis and management of ua in a 5-year - old boy .
unicystic ameloblastoma ( ua ) was first described by robinson and martinez in 1977 as a special type of ameloblastoma .
ua usually appears very similar to a non - neoplastic odontogenic cyst and is frequently clinically misdiagnosed as dentigerous cyst and odontogenic keratocyst hence , histological confirmation is mandatory from the management point of view .
a 5-year - old boy presented to our unit center for dental education and research , all india institute of medical sciences , new delhi , india with a painless hard swelling in the lower chin region of 3 months duration .
pre - operative panoramic radiograph showing radiolucent lesion in the right side of the mandible and resorption of the roots of the teeth on the basis of lingual cortical bone expansion , presence of cystic fluid on aspiration and evident of root resorption of the teeth in the panorex , we made the provisional diagnosis of ua .
because in an attempt to preserve the tooth without damage , tumor remnants may be left around the tooth apex or root and these may lead to recurrence we carried out the same procedure in the case i.e. enucleation followed by application of carnoy 's solution for 3 min , extraction of all involved teeth and close follow - up .
