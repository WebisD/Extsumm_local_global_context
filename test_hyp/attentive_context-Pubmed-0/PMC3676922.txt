bacterium has been identified as bacillus amyloliquefaciens ss35 on the basis of 16s rdna and partial gyrase a gene sequence analyses .
the cmcase production has been observed to be associated with cell growth and has maxima at the late exponential phase of growth .
rhinoceros are presumed to have an efficient system for cellulose digestion , as its main food wild grass primarily consists of cellulose . in this study
the phylogenetic tree generated using 16s rdna gene sequences of the isolate ss35 showed that the bacterium has the highest homology with bacillus amyloliquefaciens
some studies have explained that the crude fiber degradation in gut is not optimal , and the fiber content of feces is still high , which can be utilized efficiently by microbes present in the feces of the herbivores .
, the dung of the pachyderm from kaziranga national park , assam , india , has been used as the source of cellulolytic bacteria .
this value was higher than activity of cmcase produced from some known natural isolates ( expressed per ml of cell - free culture broth ) , for example , cellulomonas sp .
therefore , in this study partial gyra gene sequences have been used for the confirmation of the result obtained from 16s rdna sequence analysis .
