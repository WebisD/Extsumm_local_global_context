the authors present a case in which misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment of a buccal cheek laceration due to an ill - fitting denture resulted in a buccal space abscess that progressed into cst .
a 65-year - old man with no past medical history presented to the emergency room with facial swelling and fever .
clinicians in oral and maxillofacial surgery should be aware of cst and should consider it in patients with facial swelling .
cst is an infectious disease that is potentially fatal if it is not treated in its early stage .
there are very few reports of cst related to periodontal disease or to tooth extraction3 .
cst is a rare condition in which blood clots form within the cavernous sinus , a large collection of thin - walled veins .
the only suspicious finding was a small laceration on left buccal mucosa . generally , odontogenic infections arise from the teeth themselves or from periodontal tissue . therefore , it was difficult to confirm that this severe infection originated from a small laceration in a patient with no medical history .
it presents with proptosis , chemosis , periorbital swelling and other typical signs of infection including as fever , pain and swelling .
