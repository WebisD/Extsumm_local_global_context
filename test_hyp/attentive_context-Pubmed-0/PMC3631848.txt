english translation of the german dsqols and to examine its psychometric properties in adults with type 1 diabetes in the u.k . and
following forward - backward translation and reconciliation and piloting ( with adults with type 1 diabetes and review by clinicians in ireland ) , face and content validity of the u.k .
examination of the scale structure using efa revealed a six - factor solution , confirmed with two independent cfas , demonstrating good fit of this model to available datasets .
the weaker correlations between the dsqols subscales and the addqol diabetes - dependent overview item were to be expected , as the latter is not considered sufficient to capture the full impact of diabetes on qol ( 10 ) .
given the mismatch between the structure of the two scales [ i.e. , the dsqols has six subscales ( summarizing its 57 items ) and the separate 20-item preference - weighted treatment satisfaction scale , and the addqol has one overall score based on the awi for all 19 domains ] , the moderate correlations are considered reasonable and the strong correlations highly satisfactory .
the psychosocial study is a longitudinal evaluation of structured education conducted to identify predictors of qol and glycemic outcomes .
