> z250 > quixfil moreover , for 1 and 2 mm thicknesses , the bottom vhn of quixfil was significantly lower than the two other composites
a tukey test demonstrated that the vhn of the top surface ( thickness= 0 ) of the materials decreased in the following order : 
 photocore > z250 > quixfil photocore
z250 photocore > quixfil > z250 the satisfactory depth of cure for z250 was up to 3 mm and up to 5 mm for the two other composites ( fig .
so for being on the safe side , it is recommended to apply composite in the layering technique with 2 mm thickness in each layer .
, we prepared 144 specimens of three selected resin composites for each composite type ( n=48 ) and there were 8 subgroups according to their mold height ( n=6 for each subgroup ) .
the aim of his study was to evaluate the possibility of adequate curing - depth in bulk - curing of two translucent core build - up composites other than incremental technique , which are said to have a high depth of cure .
. in 3-mm thickness only the vhn for photocore was significantly higher than the two other composites , but in other thicknesses ( 4 and 5 mm ) there were significant differences between all three composites in the following order : 
 photocore > quixfil >
