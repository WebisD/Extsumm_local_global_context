we report an uncommon case involving a low - grade brainstem glioma with spinal dissemination , but without local recurrence , and a progressive course associated with hemorrhage .
we report an uncommon case involving a low - grade brainstem glioma with spinal dissemination , but without local recurrence .
it is known that approximately 5% of low - grade gliomas present with leptomeningeal dissemination at the time of diagnosis , and 7 - 10% of low - grade gliomas present with leptomeningeal dissemination at the time of disease progression15 ) .
recently , report of leptomeningeal dissemination of low - grade glioma is increasing as reflecting the common use of diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging ( mri)15 ) .
leptomeningeal dissemination of tumor cells is frequently observed in terminal stage of malignant brain tumors , regardless of the primary origin . occasionally , benign brain tumors , such as low - grade gliomas , spread to the subarachnoid space14 ) .
the patient was a 16-year - old boy who presented with diplopia , decreased vision , and gait disturbance of 2 months duration . on the neurologic examination
one study reported the frequency of leptomeningeal dissemination via histology : pilocytic astrocytoma 3% , low - grade fibrillary astrocytoma 2% , gangliolioma 4% , mixed glioma 5%10 ) .
