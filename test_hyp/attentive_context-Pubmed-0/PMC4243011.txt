the epstein  barr virus ( ebv ) was described by michael anthony epstein and yvonne barr , who isolated ebv virus particles from endemic burkitt lymphoma specimens .
additionally , newly recognized subgroups of lymphomas , such as the ebv - positive dlbcl of the elderly , require the detection of ebv in more lymphoma entities as part of the diagnostic process .
this is due on the one hand to the aging of many populations , with an increase in age - associated ebv reactivation . on the other hand , widespread access to commercial assays and
automatization leads to an increasing use of in situ hybridization for eber by diagnostic pathologists .
ebv is a double stranded dna virus of the herpes virus family and is the most common virus affecting humans .
ebv also plays a pathogenic role , mainly in the development of several t cell and b cell lymphoproliferations ( see below ) but is also associated with different types of rare epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms .
although epidemiologic data are lacking , ebv - lpd distinct from overt lymphoma will be increasingly recognized .
the life cycle of ebv is composed of a lytic state and a latency state , the latter allowing lifelong persistence of the virus in the host .
