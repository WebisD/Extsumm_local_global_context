finally , understanding patient preference may be a strategy to improve adherence to osteoporosis therapy , since a lower treatment satisfaction is associated with an increased risk of discontinuing or switching the ongoing osteoporosis medication , as compared with a higher treatment satisfaction.23 in this review , we will focus on the results of studies that investigated patient preference and adherence to dmab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in comparison with alternative osteoporosis therapies , especially bisphosphonates , in order to establish who can take more advantage of dmab therapy , to understand the possible factors that influence medication - taking behavior , and to discover potential strategies for improving adherence .
these efforts are addressed to improve adherence to osteoporosis treatment and , as a consequence , to achieve more successful treatment outcomes , thus positively impacting on the cost - effectiveness of the chosen drug.45 from this perspective , according to the data demonstrating a better adherence to dmab compared to other osteoporosis treatments , especially bisphosphonates , dmab may represent a reasonable and effective alternative to bisphosphonates , particularly for osteoporotic women in whom a suboptimal or even poor adherence to oral treatments is expected .
