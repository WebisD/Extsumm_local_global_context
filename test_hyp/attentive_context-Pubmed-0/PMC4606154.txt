the ratio of nirk / nirs gene copies abundance was always greater than 1 , indicating that the surface of e. crassipes roots was more suitable for the growth of nirk - type denitrifying bacteria .
it put an emphasis on understanding the interactions between the changes of environmental factors and the abundance and diversity of denitrifying bacteria attached to e. crassipes roots .
the temperature of water , nitrate concentration , and ph greatly affected the nirs , nirk , and nosz abundance than other factors . meanwhile ,
water properties in different rivers in the present study were shown altering the abundance and diversity of denitrifiers on e. crassipes roots . the abundance of nirk , nirs , and nosz denitrifiers on the root of macrophytes varied with the variation of environmental parameters in different rivers , which seemed depending on the nitrogen concentrations , water temperature , water turbulence , and pretreatment of wastewater using wetland .
hence , in the present study , we investigated the abundance and diversity of denitrifying bacteria on e. crassipes roots in 11 rivers with different pollution sources in the north side of dianchi lake .
the variation in abundance of denitrifier communities on e. crassipes roots , grown in rivers flowing into dianchi lake , corresponded to different water properties of rivers .
