these results suggest that scit and slit exhibit similar efficacy . slit objectively improves symptom scores for asthma and ar while decreasing medication usage of allergy medications and sabas .
given the increased risk and difficulty in treating asthmatic and young patients , these results would suggest that slit should be considered as the main treatment modality for these patients , considering scit only for treatment failures .
shortness of breath and wheezing had significant improvements at p < 0.05 for both treatment modalities .
the remaining symptoms had a significant improvement at p < 0.001 for both treatment modalities .
the purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment results in patients with nasal allergies , with or without asthma , that were treated with either one or the other of these two treatment modalities : scit or slit .
the improvement of the asthmatic symptoms wheezing and sob and the decrease in saba use were significant at p < 0.05 yet because of sample size this is not as strong as the improvement in other symptoms or medications that had an improvement at the level of p < 0.001 .
both scit and slit provided equally significant reduction in use of medication ( p < 0.001 ) including allergy pills , ins , and , to a slightly lesser but still significant degree , saba ( table 3 ) but without no significant difference between both treatment modalities .
