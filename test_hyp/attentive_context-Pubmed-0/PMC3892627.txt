species identification of p. multocida was performed using traditional microbiological methods and confirmed with 16s rrna sequencing and matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ) .
a 38-year - old man was admitted to our hospital with a 2 days history of fever , malaise and cellulitis around a mitrofanoff abdominal catheter .
we herein report a case in which a pet owner developed p. multocida endocarditis and was subsequently treated via opat ( outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy ) service with an excellent clinical outcome .
we propose that maldi - tof is a rapid , accurate method for the identification of p. multocida from bacterial cultures and can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis of p. multocida bacteraemia .
to our knowledge this is the twenty - first reported case of endocarditis but the first to be reported in a penicillin allergic patient . as with previous cases ,
furthermore we have shown that cephalosporins and carbapenems are probably good substitutes for penicillin in case of allergy .
the gram - negative coccobacillus pasteurella multocida is normally found in the oral cavity of dogs and cats . it is a recognised cause of wound infection as a result of bites , licking or scratching .
