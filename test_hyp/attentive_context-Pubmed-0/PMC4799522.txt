the aim was thus to estimate the accuracy of age evaluation by the analysis of measurements of dental pulp and effects of occlusal wear using digital intraoral periapical radiographs in a subset of the indian population .
analysis was done for only the maxillary teeth and the regression equation obtained was as follows : age = -175.18 x1 + -8.85 x2 + -127.96 x3 + 211.89(+/-7.31 ) where x1 , x2 , and x3 are the mean values the coefficient of determination ( r ) for only maxillary teeth was 0.6608 , with a standard error of estimate of 7.3 years ( f = 29.87 ) .
the results of this study indicate that kvaal 's method is a reliable method to estimate age in both young and older populations . with a few modifications of kvaal 's method , we could estimate age with a standard error of estimate of  6.4 - 7.8 years in a sample of the indian population
multiple regression analysis predicting chronological age from chosen predictors multiple regression analysis equation 1 : when all six teeth were considered together age = -161.04 x1 + -28.30 x2 + -191.59 x3 + 236.98 ( + /-6.42 ) where x1 , x2 , and x3 are the mean values the coefficient of determination ( r ) for all six teeth was 0.7381 , with a standard error of estimate of 6.42 years ( f = 43.272 ) .
