therefore , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) to investigate the brain processes underlying the anticipation of resistive - load - induced dyspnea in healthy volunteers . specifically , we tested the hypotheses that the anticipation of dyspnea is processed in brain areas related to the perception of dyspnea and would involve prominent activations in emotion - related areas .
the present study investigated brain activations associated with the anticipation and perception of resistive - load - induced dyspnea in healthy subjects .
furthermore , anticipatory midbrain / pag activation was associated with subsequent dyspnea - related activation of the insular cortex . during dyspnea anticipation
finally , activation in the right insular cortex and acc during the anticipation of dyspnea showed a significant positive correlation with anticipatory fear . taken together , the present study reveals prominent activation in several emotion - related brain areas during the anticipation of resistive - load - induced dyspnea , which were paralleled by increased anticipatory fear .
the prominent involvement of emotion - related areas such as insula , acc , and amygdala is suggested as potential correlate of anticipatory fear of dyspnea , which might underlie the development of unfavorable health behaviors in patients suffering from dyspnea .
