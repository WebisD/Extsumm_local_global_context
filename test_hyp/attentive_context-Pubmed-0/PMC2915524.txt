fertility is reduced in patients with renal disease , so pregnancy in patients with end - stage renal failure is uncommon .
rates of maternal hypertension , pre - eclampsia , anemia , and infection in the pregnant chronic dialysis patient are high
. however , our findings suggest that with careful , close , and effective monitoring preoperatively and intraoperatively , spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis .
a 31-year - old multiparous turkish woman was scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia at 37 weeks and five days gestation because of hemorrhage due to secondary placenta previa .
invasive blood pressure , central venous pressure , and heart rate were stable during the surgery .
we share our experience of spinal anesthesia in a pregnant woman with crf on dialysis and needing an emergency cesarean section due to placenta previa .
we believe that pregnant crf patients requiring dialysis can be urgently and safely operated on using a careful anesthesia method after a detailed renal and hematological preoperative assessment and rapid but detailed preparation .
pregnancy adds further risks , including pre - eclampsia , polyhydramnios , intrauterine growth retardation , preterm delivery , low birth weight , and the potential for a stillbirth .
