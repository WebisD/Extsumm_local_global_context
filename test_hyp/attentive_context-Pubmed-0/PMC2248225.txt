n bond , the ligand changes its conformation to facilitate the coordination in onn fashion as in the case of cd(ii ) complex as reported earlier .
the antibacterial activity of the ligand is enhanced on complexation , whereas no distinct change is observed in case of antifungal activity .
we have observed its tridentating behavior with transition metal ions . in continuation of our work on quinazolines , here we report the conformational changes in the ligand on coordination with lanthanides and the relative antimicrobial activity .
based on the above data , structure i is proposed for the lanthanide(iii ) complexes having the general 
 formula [ ln(mpbaq)2(h2o)2]no3 , where ln = la(iii ) , pr(iii ) , nd(iii ) , sm(iii ) , eu(iii ) , gd(iii ) , tb(iii ) , 
 dy(iii ) , and y(iii ) . in the present complexes , due to rotation about the n 
further , the complete absence of zero - field hyperfine splitting and the presence of broad bands indicate that the gd(iii ) ion is located in a rather disordered environment caused by strain . these strains
n(3)h 
 and c(13)h , being cis to one another , coupled together and this coupling 
 results in the splitting of c(13)h signal .
