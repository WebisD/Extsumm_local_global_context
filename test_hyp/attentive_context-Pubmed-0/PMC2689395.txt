less than 10% met criteria for poor adherence ( mpr < 80% ) ; however , we observed poor clinical and immunologic response among individuals in this group .
, we describe the impact of art adherence on immunologic response and survival in a large population of adults initiating art in lusaka , zambia .
we use the medication possession ratio  a simple metric that has been correlated with virologic outcomes in developed countries  to describe the adherence behaviour of our population .
in summary , we demonstrate that mpr correlates with patient outcomes in the settings of rapid service scale - up , task shifting and high disease burden .
for example , hogg and colleagues found that intermittent use of art ( defined as drug refills of < 75% ) was associated with a nearly 3-fold risk in mortality in british columbia .
the proportion of individuals with tuberculosis at time of art initiation was lower among individuals with suboptimal adherence ( 12.2 vs 14.0% ; p < 0.001 ) when compared with those with optimal adherence .
, good adherence is believed to be a critical determinant of long - term survival among hiv - infected individuals . where availability of second - line or salvage antiretroviral drug regimens is limited
