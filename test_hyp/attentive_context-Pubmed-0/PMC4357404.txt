c - met correlated with brain invasion and bone / soft tissue invasion . to the best of our knowledge ,
we conclude that c - met expression may be a useful predictive marker for meningioma recurrence , and that invasive meningiomas with high expression of c - met may be good candidates for targeted therapy using selective c - met inhibitors .
we set out to determinate whether the expression of c - met and hgf is associated with the invasiveness of meningiomas and their clinical implications . in the present study ,
our results demonstrate that c - met is associated with the brain invasion of meningiomas , and that c - met expression may be useful predictive markers for meningioma recurrence .
of the cases , c - met and hgf were found in 17% ( 17/100 ) and 13% ( 13/100 ) of meningiomas , respectively , and c - met / hgf co - expressions were observed in 1% ( 1/100 ) of meningiomas .
of the cases , bone / soft tissue invasion was observed in 4/17 ( 23.5% ) of c - met meningiomas and in 8/83 ( 9.6% ) of c - met meningiomas .
