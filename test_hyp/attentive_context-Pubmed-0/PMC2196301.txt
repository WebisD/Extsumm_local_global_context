the role of the src kinases in early development , our data is consistent with the notion that signaling through the pre - tcr involves both lck and fyn kinases   but is equally consistent with the idea that the fyn kinase is   involved only in signaling through the tcr- or - ,   and thereby responsible for the incomplete developmental   arrest observed in lck mice .
tcr-   chain in evolution and that the pre - tcr had simply the   advantage of making the pairing of a single tcr- chain   with different tcr- chains more effective .
the fact that the tcr-   promotes development much in the same way as the pretcr , i.e. , by cell - autonomous signaling and thereby tcr-   selection , suggests that t cell development may have proceeded in this way before the advent of the pre 
these cells   were present in a higher number in pt mice consistent with the notion that the pre - tcr may have a role in   regulating  rearrangement and/or expression ( 23 and unpublished observations ) .
however ,   in the absence of pt these receptors avoid a severe immunodeficiency by enabling the formation of a significant number of mature  t cells .
