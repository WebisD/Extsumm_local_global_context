the results of this study suggest that the use of acei , arbs , and nonselective beta - adrenergic receptor antagonists ( propranolol or carteolol ) is not associated with breast cancer .
in addition , evidence for any association between the use of aceis / arbs and breast cancer is also inconsistent , with some studies suggesting that aceis / arbs are not associated with cancer risk   , and others reporting an increased or reduced risk . to address the conflicting evidence from previous studies , the aim of the study reported here was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with long - term use of ahs in hypertensive women .
our findings indicate that the long - term use of ccbs or beta-1 selective blockers are likely to be associated with breast cancer risk .
