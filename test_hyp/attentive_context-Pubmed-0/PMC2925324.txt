the identification and characterization of -secretase substrates and the mechanistic details on the successive cleavage of substrates by the -secretase have enhanced our understanding of how partial loss - of - function associated with fad - linked ps mutations can in fact lead to a gain of activities with reference to intracellular signaling associated with certain substrates such as dcc , erbb4 , and epha4 . at least in some cases , lack of -secretase processing leads to profound changes in synaptic structure and functions as a consequence of sustained intracellular signaling by substrate ctfs .
however , it is becoming clear that fad - linked mutations in ps proteins affect diverse physiological processes in addition to promoting the production of highly fibrillogenic a42 peptides .
mutations in psen1 and psen2 genes , which encode polytopic proteins termed presenilin 1 ( ps1 ) and presenilin 2 ( ps2 ) , respectively , cause autosomal dominant early - onset familial alzheimer 's disease ( fad ) .
this paper discusses findings from various animal models that reveal the role of ps and fad - linked ps mutations in synapse formation and function .
still , the major task is to establish whether or not altered signaling directly contributes to ad pathogenesis and/or ad - related synaptic dysfunction .
