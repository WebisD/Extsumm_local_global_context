, current nomograms can be used to predict the probability of disease recurrence in patients with newly diagnosed ta , t1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder .
the purpose of this study was to develop and validate prognostic nomograms for disease recurrence in patients with ta , t1 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder .
these nonograms will facilitate patient counseling , choosing the most appropriate adjuvant treatment after tur , and determining the frequency of follow - up in individual patients .
thirty - eight training hospitals participated in this retrospective multicenter study . between january 1998 and december 2002 , 3,060 patients with newly diagnosed
they were treated with transurethral resection ( tur ) and diagnosed with ta or t1 tcc of the bladder based on the 2002 american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc ) tnm staging system ( 19 ) .
of these , multiplicity and intravesical therapy following tur were the most influential determinants for prediction of recurrence in nomograms ( fig .
this study showed that patient age , tumor size , multiplicity , tumor grade , cis , and intravesical therapy are significant predictors for recurrence in patients with ta , t1 tcc of the bladder .
