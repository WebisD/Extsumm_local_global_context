the main goal of this review was to provide an overview of the impact of different dietary sugars on peripheral and central functions . it will gather ( i ) results from studies regarding the effects of sucrose , glucose , and/or fructose on metabolism , eating behaviour , and brain responses ; ( ii ) current available data comparing the effects of these sugars , at both peripheral and central levels .
it will also propose some clues and hypotheses for future research perspectives regarding the effects of these sugars , with special focus on fructose and glucose .
an approach combining behavioural ( e.g. progressive ratio ) and metabolic ( e.g. plasma and protein levels of peptides and neuropeptides ) measurements , pet , and fmri imaging , together with the use of an animal model closer to humans ( i.e. the pig ) , would contribute to an improved understanding of the complexity of the development of diseases induced by dietary sugars .
on the other hand , there is an impressive number of studies available concerning the effects of dietary sugars , using different experimental paradigms , with different approaches , animal models , oral intake doses , in the form of sugar solutions or added in the diet , or peripheral or central administrations .
