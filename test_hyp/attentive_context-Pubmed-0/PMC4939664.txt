when a myxoid spindle cell lesion is observed in endoscopic biopsy or when there are characteristic ct findings , pamt should be included in the differential diagnosis .
however , it is difficult to determine an appropriate resection line using only the laparoscopic approach . for more appropriate resection , laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery ( lecs )
a 39-year - old male patient visited our hospital because of epigastric pain . in an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination ,
currently , distal or partial gastrectomy remains the treatment of choice . to our knowledge ,
this is a rare tumor with equal gender distribution and occurs primarily in adults with a wide age range of 783 years   .
on the other hand , gastric plexiform angiomyxoid myofibroblastic tumor ( pamt ) has recently emerged as a new entity among gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors which was first described by takahashi et al .   in 2007 .
lecs combines laparoscopic gastric resection with endoscopic imaging for tumor location and determining an appropriate resection line .
however , the bland nuclear features , low proliferative index and absence of necrosis , vascular invasion , recurrence and metastasis in all cases of pamt reported to date justify its characterization as a benign tumor .
