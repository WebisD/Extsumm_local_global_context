amniotic fluid embolism is a fatal syndrome that takes place during pregnancy or during or after delivery .
the patient was a 33-year - old , 156 cm , and 62.5 kg primipara on the sixth day of the 40th week of pregnancy , and she was hospitalized on the day before the operation for vaginal delivery .
amniotic fluid embolism was firstly described in 1926 , and it was recognized as a syndrome by steiner and lushburgh   as fetal debris were found within the pulmonary blood vessels of the parturient women who died during labor by similar clinical characteristics . although it was reported that the incident rate was 1 out of 8,000 - 15,200 live births   and the mortality was in the range of 61 - 86% , the mortality was decreased to 13.3 - 44.0% according to a recent study .
, this disease is hard to diagnose in its onset , and the treatment is still difficult .
thus , a prompt and positive treatment should be carried out if there is a parturient woman in whom a sudden cardiopulmonary collapse , respiratory failure , and hemorrhage are found .
it must be noted that even after the parturient woman has recovered from the cardiac arrest , neurologic damage caused by hypoxia can still take place .
