our study has demonstrated that treatment with obestatin accelerates healing of chronic gastric ulcers and this effect is related to improvement of mucosal blood flow , increase in mucosal cell proliferation and reduction in local expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
therefore , the aim of our present investigation was to examine whether obestatin administration exhibits any effect on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers and whether obestatin affects mucosal expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
administration of obestatin at the dose of 8 nmol / kg / dose partly , but significantly , reversed the ulcer - evoked increase in mucosal expression of mrna for interleukin-1. administration of obestatin at the dose of 8 nmol / kg / dose was without effect on the ratio of mrna for tnf- to mrna for -actin in gastric mucosa in rats without induction of ulcers ( figure 5 ) .
they are inducers of endothelial adhesion molecules , which are essential for the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial surface prior to their migration into the tissues . il-1 and tnf- play a crucial role in the stimulation of acute phase reaction . these data , together with our observation that treatment with obestatin reverses the ulcer - induced increase in mucosal expression of mrna for il-1 and tnf- ,
