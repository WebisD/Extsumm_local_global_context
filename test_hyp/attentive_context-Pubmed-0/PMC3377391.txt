further study is required to determine whether specific lineages of s. aureus are more proficient colonizers at non - nasal colonization sites , what host / bacteria genetic factors are involved , and whether this colonization plays a role in the high success of these ca - mrsa strain types . to address the high rates of s. aureus infections in northern saskatchewan , physician treatment algorithms and educational materials
usa400 was by far the predominant strain type in all 3 communities , accounting for > 98% of the mrsa isolates .
the high rates of s. aureus infections in remote northern saskatchewan communities has been attributed to a combination of risk factors , including overcrowding and poor housing conditions , inadequate hygiene , preexisting skin conditions , and previous high usage of antimicrobial drugs ( 8) .
this possibility was recently further supported by the results of a study in which the rectal carriage , but not nasal carriage , of usa300 was strongly associated with sstis in children ( 15 ) .
this hypothesis coincides with a recent report in which nasal colonization was less likely in patients with ca - mrsa sstis than in those with hospital - acquired mrsa sstis ( 12 ) .
