the two - step procedure of combining intrastromal corneal rings and phakic intraocular lens implantation may be another alternative treatment option for keratoconus with high myopic astigmatism .
toric icl has been used as an alternative for the correction of high myopic astigmatism in eyes with stable keratoconus , though irregular astigmatism is a concern due to its ability to interfere with visual rehabilitation .
nevertheless , our case report suggests that toric icl implantation may be a possible alternative surgical option for the partial visual rehabilitation of high myopic astigmatism in keratoconus patients with rgp contact lens intolerance who do not want to have a corneal transplant or other corneal surgeries .
20 months after surgery , the icl vault was decreased , resulting in mild deepening of the acd from 2.13 mm to 2.17 mm , and the manifest refraction results finally stabilized at mild myopic astigmatism ( fig .
the visual improvement with correction was maintained , and the patient was satisfied with the postoperative vision and the lack of postoperative complications .
after a toric icl implantation , our patient still had a similar amount of high order aberrations despite correcting the high myopic astigmatism .
