the results of this study indicate that the perirectal spiculate nodule and perivascular encasement depicted by the preoperative mr images are significant predictors of a local recurrence after curative surgery on a rectal carcinoma . these mr findings may be helpful in planning the appropriate preoperative adjuvant therapy .
the  statistical analysis results showed moderate to substantial agreement between the observers on the mr imaging findings as follows : 0.52 - 0.61 for outer wall penetration , of 0.38 - 0.49 for regional lymph node involvement , and of 0.47 - 0.68 for the presence of spiculate nodules .
the follow - up periods in the non - recurrent patients ranged from 40 to 65 months ( mean duration : 53 months ) . for a direct invasion of the perirectal fat by the primary rectal carcinoma , when the irregularity and nodular bulging of the outer wall of the rectum were used as the criteria , the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , and negative predicted value ( npv ) of the preoperative mr imaging were 94% , 26% , 78% , and 63% , respectively .
for the 17 patients in the recurrent group , the time interval between surgery and local recurrence ranged from five to 48 months ( mean duration : 17 months ) .
