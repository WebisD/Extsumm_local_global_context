taken together , our study suggests that elevated levels of c - peptide are predictive of both all - cause as well as cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing coronary angiography and raises the hypothesis that c - peptide could potentially play a causal role in atherogenesis in humans
moreover , c - peptide was associated with prevalent cad , and the severity of angiographic changes increased with c - peptide levels .
, the association of c - peptide with cardiovascular mortality could simply reflect the increased risk of patients with insulin resistance and early type 2 diabetes in our population .
the current study demonstrates that levels of the proinsulin cleavage product c - peptide are independently associated with all - cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in a large cohort of patients referred to coronary angiography .
the association remained unchanged after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors , hr 1.15 ( 1.051.25 ; p = 0.002 ; model 2 ) , and after full adjustment in model 3 , hr 1.16 ( 1.051.28 ; p = 0.004 ) .
the association remained unchanged after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors , hr 1.12 ( 1.041.20 ; p = 0.002 ; model 2 ) , and after full adjustment in model 3 , hr 1.13 ( 1.041.22 ; p = 0.005 ) .
