this case reinforces the challenges in isolating rare infections in patients with cirrhosis . in the absence of obvious infectious sources in a patient with decompensated cirrhosis
infections are common in patients with cirrhosis and have been found in up to 66% of patients with variceal hemorrhage .
we report the first known case of paracoccus yeeii bacteremia in a patient with decompensated cirrhosis who presented with variceal hemorrhage . this rare gram negative organism may not be susceptible to third generation cephalosporins .
this finding may have implications for the management of infected but culture negative patients with cirrhosis .
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of p. yeeii in a patient with cirrhosis .
prophylactic treatment with third generation cephalosporins is recommended in patients with advanced cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding to cover for the predominant causative gut flora organisms , .
treatment is recommended even if no causative organism is identified as up to 50% of patients with cirrhosis and clinical sepsis have negative cultures . identifying appropriate antimicrobials
this case of bacteremia with a rare gram negative organism is instructive regarding optimal diagnosis and treatment of infection in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who have an unclear source of infection as they have an extremely high risk of morbidity and mortality .
