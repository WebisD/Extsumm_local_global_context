therefore , we believe that examining the effects of drugs on hgfs , as well as on monocytes and macrophages , is important in the study of periodontal disease . in the present study , we examined the effect of kakkonto on lps - induced pge2 , il-6 , and il-8 production using this in vitro model .
we demonstrated that kakkonto suppresses lps - induced erk phosphorylation , resulting in the suppression cpla2 activation and further pge2 production by hgfs .
in the present study , we examined the effect of kakkonto on lps - induced pge2 , il-6 , and il-8 production by hgfs .
these results suggest that kakkonto is clinically useful for the improvement of inflammatory responses in periodontal disease .
in contrast , kakkonto increased lps - induced il-6 and il-8 production ( figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) ) . in the absence of lps , up to 0.1 
previously , we reported that the activation of the protein kinase a ( pka ) pathway by adrenaline or aminophylline increases lps - induced il-6 and il-8 production in hgfs   and that h-89 , a pka inhibitor , decreases lps - induced il-6 and il-8 production
