thus , the purpose of this study has been to evaluate the current use of pvr classifications in papers dealing with clinical practice and therapy as an indirect measure of the degree of usefulness of existing classifications .
thus , it is possible that we could reduce its prevalence after retinal detachment surgery and to improve the anatomical and functional results of this disease which resists the attempts of both basic researchers and clinicians for more than 30 years .
our findings showed the inconsistent and limited use of the current pvr classifications suggesting that it may be of benefit to produce a revised classification incorporating , if possible , the new knowledge on pvr which has been published since 1991 , pointing out new potential targets for therapeutic agents distinct from those , mainly proliferative agents , targeted by the original description of this disease .
a search in pubmed for papers published between january 2000 and january 2014 was undertaken by two independent researchers .
classifications of pvr were developed to provide clinicians with a useful tool to compare results of treatments .
inclusion criteria comprised human studies published in english , french , and spanish on pvr or retinal detachment with specific mention to pvr .
