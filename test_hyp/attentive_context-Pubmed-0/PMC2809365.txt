the aim of this study was to re - examine a 
 correlation of ccr-532 genotype with the susceptibility of itbl 
 within our patients .
all patients with itbl in this study 
 underwent percutaneous liver biopsy , and our pathologists ruled out psc 
 recurrence .
since two 
 of three studies failed to show an association between itbl and ccr-532 gene polymorphism , a general recommendation 
 for screening of olt patients for ccr-532 does not seem to be justified .
mmol / l in the wt/32 group and 155.5 mmol / l in the 32/32 group .
cmv infection 
 that demanded ganciclovir treatment was present in approximately 30% in the 
 wt / wt and wt/32 group and in both homozygous patients .
homozygous 32 patients developed no itbl compared to 11.2% 
 and 12.1% of homozygous wild - type patients and heterozygous patients , 
 respectively .
initial 
 immunosuppression was tacrolimus based in 82.6% in the wt / wt group compared to 
 84.8% in the wt/32 group .
donors of group 32/32 were younger ( 35.7 years versus 46.5 years and 
 48.5 years ) .
retransplantation of 
 the heterozygous patient was indicated due to chronic ductopenic rejection 
 following olt for psc . in the wt / wt group ,
