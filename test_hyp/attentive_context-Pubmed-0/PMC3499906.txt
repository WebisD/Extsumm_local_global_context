we analysed sexual behaviour patterns among young people with different levels of educational attainment in tanzania .
finally we sought to establish whether the association between educational attainment and sexual behaviour was changing over time by fitting interaction terms between educational attainment and time period in our regression models in a manner similar to our previous paper on prevalent hiv infection using the same datasets .
sexual behaviour patterns generally followed a pattern of  less risk  ( or at least , behaviour patterns more in line with core hiv prevention messages ) in more educated groups , or had no association with education .
our second interest was in changes over time in the association between educational attainment and behavioural risk factors : the data we present here suggest that the gap in risky behaviours between more and less educated was increasing ( males ) or stable ( females ) over time for age at first sex , stable for multiple partners and may be closing for unprotected last sex ( table 5 ) .
we have previously described how hiv prevalence among adults in tanzania remained stable at about 4% among those with no prior education between 2003/2004 and 2007/2008 , while falling steeply from approximately 8% to just 2% over the same period among those with secondary education . here , we sought to examine the patterns and trends in characteristics of sexual behaviour that might explain the shifting socioeconomic distribution of hiv prevalence over time , focusing on young people since this is the population subgroup in which prevalence trends are most likely to represent incidence patterns .
