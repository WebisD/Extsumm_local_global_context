ecg - gated ct confirms the stability of the aortic root diameter ( 38.2  5.3  mm versus 37.9  5.5  mm ; < 0.0001 ) and the increasing diameter value of the ascending aorta ( 40.2  3.9  mm versus 43.1  5.2  mm ; p = 0.0156 ) .
ecg - gated ct has been shown to provide accurate information about the aortic valve and root and may be considered as an alternative imaging technique   . the aim of our study is to compare the results of the tee ( transthoracic echocardiography ) with the results obtained by the ecg - gated 64 slices ct during the followup of patients with bav , after aortic valve replacement ; in particular we evaluated the aortic root and the ascending aorta looking for a new algorithm in the followup of these patients .
the comparison between preoperative and postoperative eet shows a significant long - term dilatation of the ascending aorta ( 37.5  4.4  mm versus 39.6  4.8  mm ; p < 0.0001 ) , while the aortic root diameter seems to be stable ( 36.4  4.1 versus 36.7  4.1  mm ; p < 0.0001 ) .
ecg - gated ct shows an aortic root of 37.9  5.5  mm and an ascending aorta of 43.1  5.2 ( table 6 ) .
