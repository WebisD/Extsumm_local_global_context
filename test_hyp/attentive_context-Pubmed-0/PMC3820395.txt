the purpose of the present study was to 
 investigate the effect of this nst method on cervical rom and shoulder pain after overhead 
 work .
the subjects were divided into two groups as follows : a control group consisting of 7 males 
 without nst , and a nst group consisting of 7 males with nst .
the cervical flexion , extension , and lateral flexion angles of the nst group were 
 significantly larger than those of the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
the ppt of ut of the nst group ( 7.21.8 lb ) was significantly higher than 
 those of the control group ( 6.32.0 lb ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
the ppt of mt of the nst group 
 ( 5.81.4 lb ) was significantly higher than those of the control group ( 5.01.2 lb ) ( p < 
 0.05 ) .
the cervical flexion , extension , and right and 
 left lateral flexion of nst group were 61.511.2 , 69.46.9 , 48.75.6 , 49.86.7 degrees , 
 respectively .
the 
 initial values of cervical flexion , extension , and right and left lateral flexion in the 
 control group were 63.44.2 , 72.86.0 , 53.92.9 , and 51.35.6 degrees , respectively .
