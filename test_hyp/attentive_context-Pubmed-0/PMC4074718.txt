this study shows that down  titrating ndo and ido patients treated with 300iu to 200iu onabotulinumtoxina leads , in 90% of cases , to similar efficacy with no apparent reduction in longevity of treatment . patients with ndo may need up titrating back to 300iu .
a retrospective notes review was performed for all patients ( group b ) that had received 200iu after 300iu up to april 2011 , to assess the efficacy and tolerability of dose reduction .
the largest systematic review to date of the use of botulinum toxin for the management of both neurogenic and idiopathic detrusor overactivity ( ndo and ido ) revealed that 300iu onabotulinumtoxina was the most commonly reported dose in the former and 200u in the latter . with the initial off  licence use of this therapy ,
three ( 7% ) patients , all with ido , had to commence intermittent self 
therefore our aim was to assess treatment efficacy and longevity after switching from 300iu to 200iu in patients with either ndo or ido .
the median longevity of efficacy was 67 months with both doses and only two patients noticed a shorter longevity of efficacy with 200iu ( 2 and 6 months ) compared to 300iu ( 7 and 8 months ) .
