several studies have demonstrated that astrocytes utilize both ionotropic and metabotropic systems in order to regulate neuron to neuron communication   , and that they may have specific mechanisms for regulating the formation of memories . here , we review recent evidence for the importance of astrocytes in both structural and functional synaptic plasticity , specifically long - term potentiation , the key chemical transmitters that are involved ( table 1 ) , as well as the underlying mechanisms by which astrocytes may regulate these processes .
in addition to their structural and metabolic roles , astrocytes are now thought to be heavily involved in synaptogenesis and in regulating the communication between already formed connections .
the method for the formation of memories and the process of functional specialization in the brain during development has been found to be mediated by both structural and functional plasticity , including long - term potentiation between neurons . while much attention has been given to these processes on a neuronal level , less attention has been given to what role glial cells , particularly astrocytes , may have in the underlying mechanisms . while astrocytes were formerly thought to serve mostly as housekeeping cells , they have recently gained attention as an integral part of the chemical synapse .
