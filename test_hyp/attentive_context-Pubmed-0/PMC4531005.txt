in this paper , we have attempted to further analyze the health care resource utilization costs of patients with schizophrenia in the people s republic of china , korea , and malaysia with specific focus on the reduction in hospitalization costs associated with the use of long - acting , injectable pp relative to alternative treatment medications . in the analysis , we combined localized cost data for the three individual countries with data on the reduction in hospitalization rates derived from a recent phase iiib trial .
given the substantial costs associated with the treatment of schizophrenia both worldwide and in asia , it is important to fully understand costs and outcomes associated with various treatment options . in this study , we have specifically analyzed the direct health care cost savings associated with hospital utilization for patients taking pp relative to alternative treatment methods .
the medication has been shown , in both short - term and long - term clinical trials , to delay relapse time and help provide symptom control for patients experiencing acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.21,22 as a result , the consistent use of long - acting , injectable pp may reduce relapse rates and hospitalization , potentially leading to a reduction in the economic burden associated with schizophrenia . the goal of this study is to estimate the reduction in hospitalization costs associated with the use of long - acting , injectable pp in the people s republic of china , korea , and malaysia relative to alternative treatment medications . in the analysis
