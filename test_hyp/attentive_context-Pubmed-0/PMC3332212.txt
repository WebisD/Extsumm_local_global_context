inflammatory abnormalities and oxidative stress are characteristic findings of obesity and play important roles in the renal damage associated with obesity , which will be discussed in detail in the following .
obesity causes chronic low - grade inflammation and systemic and local oxidative stress , which may play a pivotal role in the initiation or progression of obesity - associated glomerulopathy .
elevated inflammation in obesity is the result of the production of adipokines and increased inflammatory cytokines and decreased anti - inflammatory factors .
both inflammation and oxidative stress induce damage to renal tubule and glomerulus and result in endothelial dysfunction in the kidney
hyperinsulinemia also has been shown to stimulate the synthesis of growth factors such as insulin - like growth factor- ( igf- ) 1 and igf-2 and transforming growth factor-1 ( tgf-1 ) , which accelerate production of extracellular matrix and promote glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis   .
recent studies have demonstrated that obesity causes chronic low - grade systemic inflammation and thus contributes to the development of systemic metabolic dysfunction that is associated with obesity - related disorders and renal disease   .
hyperlipidemia may promote glomerulosclerosis through mechanisms that involve engagement of low - density lipoprotein receptors on mesangial cells , direct podocyte toxicity , oxidative cellular injury , macrophage chemotaxis , and increase renal expression of sterol regulatory element - binding proteins ( srebp-1 and srebp-2 ) , resulting in the renal accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides and together with significant renal increase of fibrogenic cytokines   .
