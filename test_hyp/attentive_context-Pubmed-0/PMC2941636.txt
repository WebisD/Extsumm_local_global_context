this issue is not trivial  about 30% of those diagnosed as having ckd in epidemiologic studies have their kidney disease identified by the finding of ma and egfr    60  ml / min/1.73  m in the absence of a self - reported diagnosis of diabetes .
regardless of the underlying mechanisms and interpretation of the pathophysiologic meaning of albuminuria , important associations exist between the quantities of albumin excreted in the urine and progressive chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) and cardiovascular ( cv ) events .
microalbuminuria ( ma ) was delineated many years ago to describe the appearance of small quantities of albumin , too little to detect by standard  dipstick  methods , in urine samples from subjects with diabetes   . according to recent guidelines
among patients with well - established kidney disease ( ie , egfr < 4550  ml / min/1.73  m ) , the magnitude of albuminuria can be viewed as a marker of a more progressive course and a more rapid loss of renal function ( a  risk marker  rather than a  risk factor  ) for both diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease   .
these considerations are important when one attempts to relate albumin excretion rates to the definition of kidney disease , because albuminuria arising from diffuse endothelial cell injury ( eg , in atherosclerosis and hypertension ) might best be regarded as a sign of a systemic disease process , affecting many organs and systems , rather than one originating in the kidneys .
