the goal of this paper is to describe the development of the feeding dynamics intervention ( fdi ) , a parent - targeted program based on the feeding dynamics approach in addition to evidence - based lifestyle behaviors known to prevent or treat childhood obesity .
they include researchers ( a ) investigating the outcome of the fdi with a larger and diverse population , ( b ) studying the degree to which children can be taught to recognize hunger and satiety cues via parent - directed intervention versus a child - targeted intervention , ( c ) videotaping within the home to assess the feeding environment rather than relying on caregiver self - report , ( d ) using objective assessments of self - regulation such as the energy compensation and eating in the absence of hunger tests , ( e ) validating the acceptability and feasibility of the physical activity component , and ( f ) exploring short- and long - term effects of the fdi on the child 's anthropometrics and eating behaviors .
first , we developed the fdi , an innovative program which incorporates evidence - based recommendations for childhood obesity and a core focus on feeding dynamics . from our studies , we modified and expanded on the feeding dynamic concepts by adapting them appropriately to be pragmatic , cognizant of the prevailing obesogenic environment , and responsive to the mother 's needs and diversity in the child 's eating behaviors and patterns .
