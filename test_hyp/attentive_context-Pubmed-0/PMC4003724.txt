dyskeratosis congenita ( dc ) is a rare multisystem disorder first described in the early 20 century ( 1906 ) ; it is also known as zinsser - engman - cole syndrome.1 it is characterised by the classic triad of mococutaneous pigmentary disorder , nail dystrophy and oral leukoplakia seen in 89% , 80% and 45% of cases respectively.2 however abnormalities involving the digestive system ( oesophageal stricture , liver cirrhosis ) , ocular ( corneal ulcers , conjunctivitis , blepharitis , lacrimal duct stenosis with epiphoria ) , neurologic ( mental retardation , delayed developmental milestones ) have also been reported,3 and bone marrow failure occurs in about 75% of cases with x - linked form.4 bone marrow failure is the major cause of death , while other causes of mortality are pulmonary fibrosis and malignancy .
there is scarcity of information on this disorder among nigerians to the best of our knowledge .
the case of a 9-year - old boy , who had all the major clinical features - hypo-/hyperpigmentation of the skin , nail dystrophy , leukoplakia and early bone marrow failure- which before now had not been documented in nigeria , is reported .
