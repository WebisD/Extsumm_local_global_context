hence , the aim of this in vitro study is to evaluate the color change in teeth bleached with two different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide , using sweet potato extract as an additive , with the help of a spectrophotometer , and furthermore , to evaluate the surface changes in the enamel post bleaching , using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .
under the limitations of this in vitro study , it can be concluded that the use of hydrogen peroxide ( both 35 and 10% ) containing sweet potato extract , as a bleaching agent , not only results in the restoration of natural tooth color , but also decreases the effects of bleaching on the enamel morphology , compared to the use of hydrogen peroxide alone .
the mean e values of group ib ( 35% h2o2 + sweet potato extract - 72.52  2.03 ) and group iib ( 10% h2o2 + sweet potato extract - 71.50  1.81 ) were significantly higher compared to their respective baseline values ( p < 0.001 )
. the mean e values of groups ib and iib were significantly higher than those of groups ia ( 35% h2o2 - 65.24  1.02 ) and iia ( 10% h2o2 - 64.19  1.88 ) , respectively , ( p < 0.05 ) .
