therefore , the 
 purpose of this study was to identify the effects of joint mobilization using keomt and pnf 
 on a patient with clbp and a lumbar transitional vertebra .
joint mobilization using keomt and pnf had a positive 
 effect on the spinal motion , pain , and thickness of the multifidus of a patient with clbp 
 and a lumbar transitional vertebra .
this study was a single subject case study , but it is 
 meaningful in that it presented spinal motion , pain , and muscle activity in a patient with a 
 lumbar transitional vertebra . a larger number of patients will need to be studied in the 
 future .
computer 
 tomography ( ct ) showed six lumbar vertebrae , which is one more lumbar vertebra than a normal 
 person ( fig .
the purpose of this study was to identify the effects of joint mobilization using 
 keomt and pnf techniques in a patient with clbp and a lumbar transitional vertebra .
this study was a case study of a single patient with clbp and a lumbar transitional 
 vertebra .
the rom of flexion increased from 14 to 20 , and the rom of 
 extension increased from 1 to 4. in the lumbar vertebra , the angle of spinal curvature 
 increased from 12 to 20. the rom in flexion increased from 33 to 47 , and the rom of 
 extension increased from 2 to 7 ( table
