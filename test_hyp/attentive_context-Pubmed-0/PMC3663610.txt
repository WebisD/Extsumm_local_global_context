multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a chronic progressive inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of human central nervous system ( cns ) which usually affects young adults , with a reported median age of onset of approximately 30 years.1 in approximately 85% of patients with ms , the disease is initially recognized by a relapsing - remitting course which may eventually lead to a progressive deterioration of neurological status along with significant loss of neurological function.2 neuropathologically , ms presents with various patterns , however , inflammatory demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss and neuronal and axonal degeneration3 constitute salient features of microscopic examination of ms lesions .
pharmacological agents which block potassium channels have been investigated in the context of clinical trials with positive impact on impulse conduction in experimentally - induced demyelination as well as in patients with ms .
while this new oral blocker of voltage - gated potassium channels does not have any impact on the underlying pathology of ms , it has been demonstrated to improve fatigue and walking ability in these patients .
pathogenesis of ms involves loss of oligodendrocyte / myelin complex which turn results in re - organization of axolemmal ion channels which leads to conduction abnormalities including conduction delay or block .
