however , the annotation and classification of -barrels in the aforementioned databases is incomplete , the coverage is limited and there are also many false positives ( i.e. lipoproteins or peripheral proteins ) ; this urges the need for intensive studies and careful data collection regarding these proteins .
these methods are based grossly on hydrophobicity ( 10 ) and statistical analysis ( 11,12 ) , remote homology detection ( 13 ) , hidden markov models ( hmms ) ( 1418 ) , feed - forward neural networks ( 1921 ) , radial basis function neural networks ( 22,23 ) and support vector machines ( 24 ) , whereas others like bomp ( 25 ) , tmb - hunt ( 26,27 ) and the tmb - finding pipeline ( 28 ) are oriented towards genome scale discrimination of -barrel membrane proteins .
a previously presented benchmark of several topology prediction methods indicated that hmms are the most reliable predictors ( 29 ) .
integral membrane proteins account for 2030% of fully sequenced proteomes ( 1 ) . to date , two major structural architectures can be distinguished : the -helical and the -barrel membrane proteins .
in order to create ompdb , we based our research along three main axes , namely the available 3d structures , the profile hmms ( phmms ) deposited in version 24.0 of the pfam database ( 41 ) that correspond to domains found solely in transmembrane ( tm ) -barrel omps , coupled with an extensive literature search for novel -barrel proteins that are reported as such but can not be retrieved from the databases otherwise .
