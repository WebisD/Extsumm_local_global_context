rufinamide is a promising adjunctive agent for the treatment of pediatric lgs and may significantly decrease seizure frequency in patients who are refractory to other therapies .
the available literature to date examining rufinamide , a third - generation aed , for the treatment of lgs suggests that it is both a safe and effective adjunctive treatment option for patients who are refractory to therapy with multiple aeds .
the antiepileptic efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide was established in a clinical trial which led the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) to grant it orphan drug status in 2004 .
a pubmed search was conducted by the authors for available studies limited to the terms  rufinamide  and  lennox - gastaut syndrome  .
rufinamide then received fda approval in early 2009 for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with lgs in patients four years and older , as well as for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults and adolescents .
lennox  gastaut syndrome ( lgs ) is an uncommon but refractory epileptic encephalopathy of childhood , with a peak onset at 35 years of age.13 it is classified by the international league against epilepsy as a symptomatic generalized syndrome and requires a triad of clinical characteristics for diagnosis.4 first , patients exhibit an interictal slow spike - and wave pattern ( less than 2.5 hz ) on the electroencephalogram with paroxysmal fast rhythms ( 10 hz ) during sleep .
