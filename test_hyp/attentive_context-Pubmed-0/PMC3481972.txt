when a limb muscle is stretched , changes in the expression of myosin heavy chain ( myhc ) , the protein primarily responsible for the contractile speed and metabolism type of muscle fibers , are observable within days.1 when stretched , muscle fibers tend to change from a fast phenotype ( mainly comprising myhc iib ) to a slow phenotype ( consisting mainly of myhc i or rarely i).1 - 6 these changes , although controversial , occur along a continuum of changes in the expression of myhcs from isoform iib to iso form i.7 in addition , the expression of less common isoforms , such as embryonic or neonatal myhcs ( developmental myhcs ) , may also be increased.8 the same responses might occur in the masticatory muscles after an increase in occlusal vertical dimension and/or mandibular advancement.9,10 in animal models , functional appliances commonly used for orthodontic treatment induce a phenotypic change in masticatory muscle fibers , with a tendency toward transition to a slow phenotype.11,12 slow fibers are fatigue resistant and easily convertible to fast fibers ; in comparison , fast fibers are fatigable but difficult to convert to slow fibers .
however , a phenotypic change appears to occur only within the fast fiber population , and a definite molecular change among slow fibers remains controversial.9,10,13 the aims of this study were to examine whether a passive stretch stimulus by means of a functional appliance induces changes in the fiber composition of masticatory muscles and whether these changes are similar to the changes in stretched leg muscle fibers by using rt - pcr , western blot , and immunohistochemical assays .
