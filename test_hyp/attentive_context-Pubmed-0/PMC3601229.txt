the aims of our study were to 1 ) to identify approximate timelines by which the functional recovery of b / l - tka would match their preoperative status and also the recovery of patients with u / l - tka ; 2 ) assess the effect of the status of the contralateral knee in u / l - tka on functional recovery .
the operative status of the contralateral knee makes no difference to early functional recovery after unilateral tka . with bilateral tka
arthroplasty surgeons presenting surgical treatment options to patients with osteoarthritis are handicapped by the paucity of literature on early and intermediate functional outcomes following u / l - tka and b / l - tka surgery .
even the pain , stiffness and physical function sub - scores were statistically better in the u / l + c / l - tka group preoperatively .
comparison between pain values at all time intervals comparison between range of motion across all time intervals timed up and go test values comparison within group comparison between timed up and go test values across all 3 groups western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index questionnaire score and short form-12 comparisons preoperatively , 3 months and at 1 year los was five days for patients undergoing u / l - tka and six days for b / l - tka patients .
