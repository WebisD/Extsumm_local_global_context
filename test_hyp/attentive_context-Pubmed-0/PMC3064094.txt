the suppression of -cell proliferation secondary to changes in the expression of p21 , cyclin d2 , and pdx-1 in this mouse model of accelerated aging implicates impaired p53 function in the development of type 2 diabetes in the elderly .
by using p44tg mice with an ectopic p53 gene that encodes 40p53 ( 36 ) , we have identified a role for the tumor suppressor p53 in the maintenance of normal -cell mass and glucose homeostasis .
the presence of a p53 response element in the somatostatin promoter ( genomatix ) warrants further studies to evaluate whether the increase in somatostatin actually decreases insulin secretion or limits -cell growth in a paracrine manner in the p44tg mice . in summary , increased dosage of 40p53 in mice promotes hypoinsulinemia and glucose intolerance , ultimately leading to overt diabetes with age and early death .
biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the stability and activity of the p53 tetramer are exquisitely sensitive to the dose of 40p53 , with low doses of 40p53 activating and high doses inactivating p53 function ( 40,41 ) .
the expression of 40p53 in p44tg mice can also account for the higher level of mrna encoding the igf-1r , whose transcription is differentially regulated by wild - type and mutant p53 ( 39 ) .
