nevertheless , the results presented here may be representative of the nation - wide data on current ia thrombolytic treatment , and they could serve as a basis for clinical practice guidelines , as well as for designing a prospective study on the basis of this protocol . in conclusion , our multicenter , retrospective analysis of ia thrombolysis showed an increased dependency on mr imaging during the initial patient evaluation and increased application of combined pharmacologic / mechanical thrombolysis in korea .
furthermore , our analysis of the imaging data was limited due to the between - center differences in the imaging protocols , including the use of contrast enhancement , mr pulse sequences and the angiographic filming techniques .
we found that from the symptom onset , the mean time before the imaging was 2.3 hours , and the mean time before the treatment was 4.7 hours ; these results are comparable with those reported in the proact ii trial ( 7 ) .
only patients who underwent an ia recanalization procedure due to acute anterior circulation ischemia in the internal carotid artery ( ica ) and the middle cerebral artery ( mca ) , and this was performed within the past five years , were included in this review .
