our study suggests that student participation and immersion in patients lives through a hospital - to - community longitudinal experience can combine those processes in a developmentally appropriate manner .
the 2010 carnegie report advocated  standardizing learning outcomes and individualizing the learning process , promoting multiple forms of integration , incorporating habits of inquiry and improvement , and focusing on the progressive formation of the physician s professional identity ( 6 ) .
students were required to reflect on their hospital and community encounters with their patients and to submit written narratives addressing all three components of the following : ( 1 ) the world of the patient and its impact on illness , ( 2 ) the impact of illness on the patient s world and ( 3 ) the patient s interactions with the health care system .
the diverse perspectives of individual patient s experiences can be harnessed as a powerful , previously untapped or underutilized teaching tool .
content was analysed in part using the three original guiding statements : the world of the patient and its impact on illness , the impact of illness on the patient s world and the patient s interactions with the health care system and on drawing on the grounded theory analysis methodology ( 28 ) .
