in addition we evaluated patients ' adherence when responsible physician referred the patients to a dxa - scan .
glucocorticoid - induced osteoporosis is an important side effect of treatment with gc amongst patients with pmr and gca . the frequency of osteoporosis ranges between 14.9 and 85% in patients .
only 2 patients ( 1.7% ) did not take calcium and vitamin d at all , and 10 patients ( 8.5% ) took their medication infrequently , 9 and 1 out of 10 patients took the medication 50100% of the time and less than 50% of the prescribed dose , respectively ( figure 2 ) .
the reasons for incomplete adherence were forgetfulness in 42.9% of patients , 35.7% of patients could not explain the reason , one patient did not want to eat so many pills , one patient claimed of side effects , and one patient thought prophylactic calcium and vitamin d supplement was unnecessary ( figure 3 ) . from the 118 patients 113 ( 95.7% )
