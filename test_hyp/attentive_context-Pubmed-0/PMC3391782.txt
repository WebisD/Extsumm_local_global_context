the reverse shoulder arthroplasty was approved by the fda in 2004 and has proven a very effective prosthesis for treatment of cuff tear arthropathy and other shoulder conditions requiring arthroplasty in the setting of a deficient rotator cuff . however , in some series , the overall revision rate for the reverse shoulder is approximately 10% , with instability and infection being the most common precipitating causes.  studies have also shown that aseptic loosening may contribute to 7% of failures , but as indications expand and long - term follow - up increases , the incidence of aseptic loosening will likely increase .
we examine a group of patients after conversion of failed or infected reverse shoulder replacement to hemiarthroplasty ; the level of function and pain in this group is important for surgeons and patients considering a revision reverse shoulder replacement .
removal of the reverse shoulder replacement and conversion to hemiarthroplasty results in a shoulder with minimal meaningful function but with an acceptably low level of pain .
this information can be helpful when discussing preoperatively the relative risk of revision reverse arthroplasty versus conversion to hemiarthroplasty in patients with a failed reverse replacement .
from 2008 to 2010 , the senior author performed 115 primary and revision shoulder arthroplasty procedures . as part of the shoulder registry ( irb#10 - 000859 )
