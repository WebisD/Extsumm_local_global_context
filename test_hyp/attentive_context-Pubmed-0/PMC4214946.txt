although the prevalence of metastases to the thyroid gland is variable in previous reports , metastasis to the thyroid gland is known to be an uncommon condition .
we report a case of tumor - to - tumor metastasis involving metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma .
a 53-yr old man underwent an anterior resection of his cancerous sigmoid colon and adjuvant chemotherapy on november 14 , 2005 .
the present patient is the first example of colonic adenocarcinoma metastasizing to medullary carcinoma of the thyroid .
fourteen cases of metastatic tumor to the primary thyroid carcinoma have been reported previously in the literature .
the majority of reported primary thyroid carcinomas were papillary thyroid carcinoma ( ptc ) , including follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma ( fvptc ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) . to our knowledge , there has been no reported case of a tumor metastasizing to medullary thyroid carcinoma ( mtc ) .
( 13 ) , proposed criteria for the diagnosis of tumor - to - tumor metastasis ; 1 ) the presence of more than one primary malignant tumor must be proved , 2 ) the recipient tumor must be a true neoplasm , and 3 ) the donor malignant tumor must be a true metastasis , with established growth and invasion in the tumor
