aim of this case report is to strengthen awareness for imported endemic systemic mycosis - in particular paracoccidioidomycosis - and emphasize the similarities to tuberculosis and importance of travel history .
our case report describes the complex journey from presentation to diagnosis and treatment of a patient with paracoccidioidomycosis in a non - endemic area and a history of tuberculosis .
we report on a rare case of paracoccidioidomycosis in europe that was initially misdiagnosed and treated as tuberculosis .
depending on the patient 's clinical presentation , travel history , and treatment success , endemic systemic fungal infections should be considered for differential diagnosis . with an increase in migration and travel activities
a 62-year - old man was transferred from a community hospital to our department due to suspected diagnosis of reactivated tuberculosis of the lungs and adrenal glands in february 2015 ( day 0 ) .
the finding of bilateral adrenal enlargement with primary adrenal insufficiency and the history of tuberculosis revealed reactivation and dissemination of tuberculosis as the most likely diagnosis upon presentation to our center .
paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus paracoccidioides brasiliensis 
 .
diagnosis and therapy of the last episodes labeled as tuberculosis reactivations three and five years before presentation to our hospital was based solely on histopathological findings of adrenal epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis . despite long - term tuberculostatic therapy ,
