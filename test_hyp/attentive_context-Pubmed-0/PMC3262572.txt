wherein a larger volume of heart and lung is irradiated , there is a compelling argument to incorporate igrt in our daily set up , to achieve optimal results with minimal toxicity . for accelerated partial breast irradiation in particular ,
we conclude with a brief discussion of image guidance and its utility in whole and partial breast radiation .
the overarching question remains , can we minimize without compromise ? results of randomized and large single - institution studies seem to support the edict that attaining this desirable balance is indeed possible .   reducing target volume , as in the case of external beam apbi techniques , calls for more refinement of treatment delivery with image - guided radiation therapy to ensure accurate delivery of high - dose radiation while sparing normal tissue such as heart and lungs .
multiple randomized studies have demonstrated equivalent survival outcomes with mastectomy versus breast conservation therapy ( bct , breast conservation surgery ( bcs ) , and adjuvant radiation therapy ) in the treatment of early stage breast cancer   .  
hypofractionated breast radiation therapy offers the attractive alternative of shorter treatment course which is not only convenient for patients , but also time and cost - effective .
