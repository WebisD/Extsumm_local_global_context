data from the presented study show that the phage therapy was effective in the prevention of renal infection in a model of cronobacter - induced urinary tract infection in mice . inflammation and oxidative stress were reduced in the kidney and partially reduced in the bladder .
analysis of expression of tnf alpha and mcp-1 revealed that both cytokines were upregulated in the bladder of infected mice ( tnf alpha by 72% ; t=3.02 ; p=0.007 ; mcp-1 by 52% ; t=3.03 ; p=0.007 ) .
it has been demonstrated in vitro that contamination of powdered milk formulas with cronobacter can be effectively eliminated with selected cronobacter - specific phages . to our knowledge , the potential of phage therapy to control cronobacter infection in animal models of human diseases has not yet been tested ; therefore the aim of our study was to prove the effects of phage therapy on cronobacter - induced urinary tract infection ( uti ) in a murine model .
malondialdehyde as a marker of lipoperoxidation was doubled in the kidneys of infected mice ( t=4.15 ; p=0.0009 ; figure 2b ) and lowered with phage therapy by 39% ( t=2.94 ; p=0.008 ; figure 2b ) .
