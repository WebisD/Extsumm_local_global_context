while hypervascular lesions can mimic pavm , we observed a rare case of a lung granuloma mimicking pavm , and performed video - assisted thoracic surgery ( vats ) .
pulmonary arteriovenous malformation ( pavm ) , first described in 1897 by churton , is characterized by abnormal communications between pulmonary veins and arteries , and is known to disturb the filtering action of pulmonary capillaries , causing thromboembolic event in systemic circulation .
in conclusion , clinicians should pay particular attention to enhanced nodules to rule out a variety of disorders , including neoplasm , infection , inflammatory and vascular abnormality when pavm was suspected .
conclusive diagnosis is generally made by means of pulmonary arteriography or three - dimensional computed tomography ( 3d - ct ) angiography .
a 76-year - old woman , who was otherwise symptom - free , was admitted to our hospital because an abnormal shadow was detected in the left lung field on her chest x - ray .
the resection of lung granuloma is highly successful for an isolated malformation , and mortality rate is low in this surgery .
for the purpose of not only diagnosis but also for safety in treatment of pavm , the surgical approach seems appropriate .
