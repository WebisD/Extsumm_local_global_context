finally , we recommend testing for gssd in patients with metabolic acidosis or hemolytic anemia in the newborn period as early recognition and initiation of therapy appears to correlate with better outcomes .
patients with the mild gssd present with isolated hemolytic anemia as their only clinical symptom whereas patients with the moderate form of the disorder present with hemolytic anemia and metabolic acidosis in the neonatal period .
glutathione ( gsh ) is a ubiquitous tripeptide ( l - y - glutamyl - l - cysteinylglycine ) known to function in many aspects of cellular activity including protein and dna synthesis , transport , detoxification of xenobiotics and carcinogens , metabolism , and defense against free radicals and oxidative stress .
, we describe long - term follow - up of a case of severe gssd .
gssd ( mim:266130 ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that has only been described in approximately 70 individuals worldwide .
biallelic , pathogenic variants in the gss generesult in glutathione synthetase deficiency ( gssd ) .
we attribute early recognition of the disease , initiation of appropriate vitamin therapy and acidosis correction along with excellent compliance from our patient for her success to date .
