thus the research groups and physicians dealing with pancreatic cancer are very interested in finding an effective treatment for cachectic patients .
much more research and many more clinical trials are needed to increase our understanding of the syndrome and to develop therapeutic strategies for one of the major symptoms of cancer .
cancer cachexia occurs most frequently in malignancy and is associated with more than 20% of cancer deaths .
patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer are especially likely to suffer from substantial weight loss , and patients with pancreatic cancer have the highest frequency of developing a cachectic syndrome .
eicosapaentanoic acid seems to interfere with the signaling pathway of pif , and first results are promising .
although in recent years our understanding of cachexia has increased , we are still in the fledgling stages . the scientists and clinicians dedicated to finding an effective treatment for cachectic patients have their work cut out for them .
but there is still little known about this clinical issue , and our knowledge grows slowly .
many trials have been performed in the search for a treatment for cachexia , but most therapies have not fulfilled expectations . currently , eicosapaentanoic acid is being tested in cachectic patients .
