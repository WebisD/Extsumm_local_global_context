in addition , the method is expected to extend the indications for meniscal repair to radial tears where menisectomy is expected to result in functional loss , large - sized transverse tears in young patients , areas between bundles after double - bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction3 ) , and rotator cuff repair
once a meniscus is torn or treated with menisectomy , the load - bearing function of the meniscus changes and the knee joint becomes less stable , which leads to a higher risk of osteoarthritis .
between june 2007 and march 2010 , 41 meniscal tears ( 19 radial tears , 12 longitudinal tears in the red - white zone , 7 transverse tears , and 3 oblique tears ) were repaired using a fibrin clot at our institution .
second - look arthroscopy or follow - up mri was performed at an average of 8.3 months after surgery .
. however , we believe a long - term follow - up study should be conducted and biomechanical changes and systemized indications for the use a fibrin clot in meniscal repair should be investigated in future studies .
an in vitro study showed that 16% to 34% removal of the meniscus led to a 350% increase in the load on the articular surface5 ) .
