furthermore , the patients with smap showed an irreversible pattern of platelet microaggregation by adp , and the degree of smap correlated with the enhanced expression of active gp iib / iiia and p - selectin , indicating that smap is pathophysiologically active .
, the majority of type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria showed an altered profile of early platelet activation including smap events .
in the present study , 53% of type 2 diabetic patients showed smap and abnormal irreversibility of the microaggregation after low - dose adp .
given the growing concern over cardiovascular consequences in type 2 diabetic patients , further follow - up and intervention studies are needed to establish whether the inhibition of smap is a therapeutic target to prevent cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients .
< 0.001 vs. normoalbuminuric patients treated with and without aspirin , p = 0.01 vs. albuminuric patients without aspirin ( mann - whitney u test ) . to further evaluate the active state of smap , we quantitated the expression levels of active gpiib / iiia and p - selectin on the platelets .
the strong correlation between the degree of smap and the levels of urinary aer as continuous variables was investigated in the patients without aspirin intake (  = 0.53 , p < 0.001 ) , whereas the weak association between them was found in those with aspirin intake (  = 0.27 , p < 0.001 ) .
