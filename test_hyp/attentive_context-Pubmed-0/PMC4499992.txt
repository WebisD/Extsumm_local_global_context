thus , the purpose of 
 this study was to determine the effects of chewing gum on driving performance . to assess 
 this ,
however , lane position and mean distance driven across the center line did 
 not differ significantly ( p > 0.05 ; table

while chewing gum , drivers drove significantly shorter distances at speeds exceeding the 
 speed limit ( 26.61% shorter ) and off the road ( 31.99% shorter ) than those while not chewing 
 ( p < 0.05 ) .
safe driving demands the capacity to concentrate and to divide attention over multiple 
 sensory events , including visual and auditory modalities ; it also requires high - level 
 cognitive decisions in a rapidly changing environment8 . in other words ,
simulated driving studies indicate that measures of driving 
 behavior , such as speed , lane position , and time / distance across the center line and off the 
 road edge , correlate with a driver s comfort with the given driving conditions .
