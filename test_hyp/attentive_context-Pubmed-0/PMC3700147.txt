we have used oral tablet of diclofenac sodium in 50 mg dose one hour before surgery which is given as a preemptive analgesic agent in experimental group . while in control group placebo it is given one hour before surgery . with the help of our prospective randomized triple blind placebo - controlled clinical trial ,
second group ( experimental group ) had patients receiving diclofenac sodium in the preoperative ( one hour prior to surgery ) and postoperative settings .
post - operative score of tenderness shows highly significant difference , between both the groups ( p = 0.00 ) with suggestive low score in the experimental group .
the mean scores of tenderness in our study at 1-hour post - operatively in the experimental group and control group are 1.86 and 2.16 , respectively , with p - value of 0.099 which is less significant ; however , the mean scores for 3 days post - operatively for the experimental group and control group are 3.5 and 5.1 , respectively , with p - value of 0.001 which is highly significant .
