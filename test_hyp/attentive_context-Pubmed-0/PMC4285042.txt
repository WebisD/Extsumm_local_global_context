total testosterone concentrations were lower in men with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes than in healthy men after adjusting for age and bmi ( 3.830.32 ng / ml vs. 5.630.31 ng / ml , p<0.001 ) .
men with type 2 diabetes also showed lower calculated bioavailable testosterone concentrations than healthy men ( 1.580.12 ng / ml vs. 2.270.11 ng / ml , p<0.001 ) , but not calculated free testosterone concentrations .
, we examined whether serum testosterone concentrations are low in korean men with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes compared with healthy men .
the prevalence of testosterone deficiency was consistently higher in men with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes than in healthy men ( 31.6% vs. 2.4% , p<0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
, this study shows that serum testosterone concentrations are lower in men with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes than in healthy men .
however , men with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes had higher fasting blood glucose levels and lower serum albumin concentrations than the healthy men .
there was no significant difference in age , bmi , waist circumference , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , total cholesterol , or shbg level between men with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and healthy men .
