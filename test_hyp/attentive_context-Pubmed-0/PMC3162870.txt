the present case of 21-year - old male was diagnosed as dgct , a tumorous form of coc , due to its characteristic histological features ; numerous ghost cells and dentinoid material .
the calcifying odontogenic cyst ( coc ) was first described by gorlin and his colleagues ( 1962 ) , as a separate entity of odontogenic origin .
coc has been seen to be of extensive diversity in its clinical and histopathological features as well as in its biological behavior .
as all lesions are not cystic and the biological behavior is often not compatible with a cyst , there is a controversy as to whether coc is a cyst or a tumor .
microscopically , it consists of ameloblastomatous epithelial islands , with areas of ghost cell formation and varying amount of dentinoid material . the purpose of this article is to report a case of dentinogenic ghost cell tumor in a 21-year - male , in the posterior region of the mandible , which is at a comparatively younger age and at an infrequent site .
the cystic lesions are termed as  calcifying cystic odontogenic tumors  ( ccot ) and the neoplastic entity as a  dentinogenic ghost cell tumor(dgct ) .
