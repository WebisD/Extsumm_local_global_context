in addition , in sites treated with autologous bone , a balance between matrix deposition and resorption is observed , suggesting that the regenerative process shows a higher rate of progression , than in sites treated with the equine bone graft in which this process seems to be slower .
based on this knowledge , the aim of our work was to analyze and to compare the molecular events switched on by autologous or heterologous bone graft insertion , focusing our attention on tgf1 expression and opg / rankl ratio , to analyze resorption process , and to estimate bone graft vascularization , new bone formation and its mineralization , through vegf , bsp and sparc expression evaluation , respectively . by understanding the mechanism underlying graft integration and by comparing the results obtained with the use of the heterologous bone substitute to that obtained with the use of autologous bone
histological and clinical studies showed the possibility to have predictable results with the use of calvaria bone grafts , with no inflammatory phenomena and a minimum resorption rate during the healing period , along with a high rate of clinical success for the subsequent implant rehabilitation .
however , at the same experimental time , sites treated with autologous bone clearly show a better organization , which could ensure a better primary stability to the implant and a higher predictability of the implant - prosthetic rehabilitation .
