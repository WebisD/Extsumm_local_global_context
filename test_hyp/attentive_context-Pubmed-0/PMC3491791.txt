the purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and diagnosis of mucoid degeneration of the acl and to assess the outcomes of arthroscopic treatment in a series of 20 patients .
mucoid hypertrophy of the acl should be clinically suspected in elderly person presenting with persistent knee pain on terminal extension without preceding trauma , especially when associated with extension deficit , which is more common in elderly individual with degenerated knee .
arthroscopic debridement of mucoid hypertrophy of the acl in conjunction with notchplasty can effectively provide symptomatic improvement without instability .
unlike tears and ganglion cysts of the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) , mucoid degeneration is a less - understood entity .
the injury or loss of functional synovial lining protecting the acl is the primary lesion causing mucoid degeneration of acl though there was no significant preceding trauma that patients can relate to current symptoms.1 but the symptomatology , mri findings , and arthroscopy appearance are consistent.2 the excision of the degenerated acl has been the treatment of the choice , the authors believe that if the taut and hypertrophied acl were to be debulked and notchplasty done , full extension could be achieved without having to excise the entire acl .
