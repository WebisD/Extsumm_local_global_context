the present study was conducted to determine the frequency of hpv genotypes in patients with anogenital warts .
, our findings revealed that the most prevalent genotypes in anogenital warts were hpv 16 , 11 and 6 , respectively .
on 12 couples with genital warts , 78% of couples had the same hpv dna , detected by dna hybridization ( 13 ) . in conclusion
thus , the pcr can be a screening test for detection of hpv dna in precancerous lesions of genital warts ( 4 , 5 ) .
the lesions in males were detected on the penis ( 24 cases ) , scrotum ( 1 case ) , penis - scrotum ( 11 cases ) and suprapubic area ( 1 case ) .
a total of 26 ( 56.6% ) samples were from males and 20 ( 43.4% ) from females while eight ( 14.81% ) showed negative results for hpv dna ( table 1 ) .
all patients had negative test results for vdrl , hbs ag , hiv and hcv antibodies . out of 54 samples , 46 ( 85.18% ) cases showed positive results for hpv dna .
the results of sequencing revealed that frequency of hpv16 , hpv11 and hpv6 was 58.69% , 26.08% and 15.21% , respectively .
