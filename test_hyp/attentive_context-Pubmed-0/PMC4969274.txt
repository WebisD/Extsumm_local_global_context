paratuberculosis ( map ) is a causative agent of johne 's disease or paratuberculosis , which is a chronic debilitating disease in ruminants that is characterized by incurable enteritis and persistent diarrhea .
the most important factors to consider in vaccine studies are the mechanisms related to the host - pathogen interaction .
the general characteristics of johne 's disease with respect to the pathogenesis and immune response to map , as well as recent advances in development of vaccines were briefly examined .
much more efforts are needed to understand exactly how bacteria can evade the host defense system , and these should focus on not only an adaptive immune system , but also innate immunity .
this is because vaccination can reduce the incidence of map shedding and manifestation of clinical signs , which is more cost - effective than testing and culling .
vaccines that can induce both immune responses may have improved protective effects . despite some limitations , vaccines might still be an effective strategy to reduce or eradicate johne 's disease in livestock industries .
these findings indicate that an infection rate of map is increasing and there is a need to establish an efficient program for control of this pathogen .
