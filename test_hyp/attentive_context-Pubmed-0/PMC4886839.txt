although cs mrna production increased in exercise group ( ep ) and combined treatment group ( erg ) , there was no significant differences in the cs activity , which indicated that production of a specific mrna and the protein it encodes do not have a direct relationship to the temporal and positional differences .
due to the muscle fiber type composition of the plantaris that it is mainly of type ii muscle fibers , it was expected that the changes in the capacity of aerobic exercise caused by long - term swimming were likely to be greater than other hind - limb muscles , which was the reason why the plantaris was chosen for this study .
in this study , whether acute uptakes of rg1 following 6-week swimming can give any additive benefit on aerobic exercise capacity in sd rats was examined .
seven rats were assigned to each group and they went through adaptation periods for cage and swimming exercise for 10 days before the onset of treatment .
however , acute uptakes of rg1 following long - term swimming was shown to provide an additive effect on aerobic exercise capacity when using the swimming time to exhaustion test .
