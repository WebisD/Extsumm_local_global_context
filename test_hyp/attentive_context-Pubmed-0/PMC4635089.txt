in addition , fvc ( in l ) and fev1 ( in l / min ) were found to be important predictors of lvm in grams or indexed to body surface area .

  stepwise multiple linear regression analysis ( table 4 ) showed that the variation in lvm among morbidly obese individuals is better predicted by fvc ( in l ) , which explained 36.9% ( p
similarly , we aimed to determine the degree of association between lung function and ventricular mass in the study population , with the goal of guiding future studies related to common mechanisms of cardiac and pulmonary impairment in morbid obesity .
in contrast , there is evidence of purely mechanical cardiopulmonary effects , with no effect of inflammatory mediators ,

  or an interaction of mechanical and inflammatory factors in cases of lung function and asthma associated with obesity .

  therefore , the primary objective of this exploratory study was to look for correlations between lung function and cardiac dimension variables , in order to test the hypothesis that regardless of being a purely mechanical or gender - related factor , the relative size of the small airways ( dysanapsis ) , as measured indirectly by the ratio of fef25 - 75% to fvc ( fef25 - 75/fvc , % ) , is correlated with left ventricular hypertrophy ( remodeling ) , since the small airways are especially susceptible to mechanical - inflammatory interactions and bronchial hyperreactivity .
