the resonance frequency analyzer can measure clinically and noninvasively the stability of implant and estimate the degree of osseointegration . in this study , we used a recently developed magnetic resonance frequency analyzer to measure the stability of implant . for measurement unit , implant stability quotient ( isq ) is used which is recorded as a number between 1 and 100 with 100 representing the highest stability.12 this study intends to measure and analyze the changes in implant stability without load during an early healing period of six months after placement of three different types of implants by one stage implant . in this way , this study will provide useful information for prosthetic treatment planning through immediate and early loading after placement of implant as well as the evaluation of long - term prognosis for it .
a total of 28 patients ( 25 males and 3 females , mean age : 58.6  9.23 ) were selected among the patients who visited between march and september 2004 with the main purpose of implant placement .
reported on the use of the resonance frequency analyzer to evaluate the stability of implant , and demonstrated the ability of the device to evaluate the changes in stiffness of the interface in the early in vitro experiment.6,7 recently , histomorphologic studies suggested that the resonance frequency value has a high correlation with the level of contact between bone and implant.8 - 11 this discovery supports the use of resonance frequency analysis to evaluate the changes in the process of osseointegration and bone healing after placement of implant .
