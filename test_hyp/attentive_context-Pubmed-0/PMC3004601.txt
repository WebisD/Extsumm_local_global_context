this paper examines the personality of mothers and its relationship to severity of addiction of their sons .
significant positive correlations were observed among mothers of substance - dependent patients on scores of depression , hypochondrias , and psychopathic deviance ( p = 0.003 , and p = 0.01 respectively ) .
this analysis of maternal mmpi scores in addicted offspring demonstrated a statistically significant correlation in the depression , hysteria and paranoia subscales .
depression scores were in the normal range ( 45 to 50 ) in 5% of study group compared to 22% of the control group ( p = 0.003 ) .
paranoia scale scores were positive in 4% of the study group , compared to 1% of controls ( p = 0.03 ) .
negative scores for hysteria were seen in 15% of the study group , compared to 40% of the control group ( p = 0.02 ) .
schweitzer and lawton12 and brook et al1 have independently reported mothers assessed as cold , indifferent , controlling , and intrusive were a major risk factor for the development of adolescent drug use .
