the case report presented above illustrates a unique and rare presentation of exostoses on the buccal side of the maxillary premolar - molar region , bilaterally .
tori and exostoses are nodular protuberances of calcified bone and are designated according to their anatomic location.1 torus palatinus ( tp ) and torus mandibularis ( tm ) are the two most common types of intraoral osseous overgrowths.2,3 tp is a sessile , nodular bony mass commonly seen on the midline of the hard palate .
the diagnosis of a buccal exostosis is based on the clinical examination along with radiographic interpretations .
tm is bony protuberance found on the lingual aspect of the mandible , in the canine and premolar region .
buccal exostoses are usually found only on the facial surface of the maxillary alveolar bone , especially in the posterior segment .
buccal and palatal exostoses are multiple bony nodular masses found less frequently than tori.1,2,4 buccal exostoses occur as bilateral , smooth bony growth along the facial aspect of the maxillary and/or mandibular alveolus . commonly found to appear in the premolar - molar region . on palpation ,
exostosis is rarely found on the facial surface of maxilla thus should not be ignored and should be carefully differentially diagnosed .
