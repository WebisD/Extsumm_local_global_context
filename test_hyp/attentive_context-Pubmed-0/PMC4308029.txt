we report the case of a patient with chronic epilepsy and cerebral palsy ( cp ) who presented with deterioration from an already impaired baseline .
the term nonconvulsive status epilepticus ( ncse ) is defined as  a range of conditions in which electrographic seizure activity is prolonged and results in nonconvulsive clinical symptoms  , .
although the eeg revealed slow pleds which are not typical of ncse , the patient showed a good clinical and eeg response to benzodiazepines with pled regression .
electroencephalogram can establish where along this continuum the patient resides , following which treatment that balances the risk  benefit needs of the patient , and the needs of chronic caregivers , can then be provided and monitored so as to offer the patient the optimal chance for regaining lost function with minimal risk .
additionally , a diagnosis of ncse may be difficult to make when this baseline is unknown and when the eeg findings represent a pattern that lies along the ictal  interictal continuum .
this 49-year - old man with cerebral palsy , mental retardation , and epilepsy residing in a long - term care facility for the prior 13  years had been awake , noncommunicative , but responsive to auditory and visual stimuli .
