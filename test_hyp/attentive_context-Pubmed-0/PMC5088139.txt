the aim of this study was to investigate the association between proprioception , involving 
 jps and ks , and handwriting legibility in children .
values obtained for jps and ks in relation to handwriting legibility are shown in table 1table 1.handwriting legibility and proprioception test results ( n=19)mean  sdjoint position sense 110 ( degree)22.530  10.063joint position sense 30 ( degree)14.256  10.408kinesthetic sense ( cm)2.044  0.703handwriting legibility ( % ) 33.521  15.852*standard deviation .
there was no correlation between writing legibility and jps at either 30 or 
 110 of elbow flexion ( p>0.05 ) .
a high ks correlated significantly with legible 
 handwriting ( p<0.05 , table 2table 2.correlation between handwriting legibility and proprioception ( n=19)handwriting legibility ( % ) joint position sense 110 ( degree)0.016joint position sense 30 ( degree)0.009kinesthetic sense ( cm)0.370*p<0.05 ) .
nineteen healthy children ( 15 boys and 4 girls ) with an average age of 9.7  0.36  years 
 participated in this study .
this study investigated the association between the legibility of handwriting and jps and 
 ks in young children .
children aged between 7 and 8  years are expected to be proficient in 
 building up their speed of handwriting , ensuring consistency in size and proportions of 
 letters as well as the spacing between letters and words9 .
