the data here reported clearly suggest the presence of sex differences in behavioral and neurochemical responses to cannabinoid compounds . the involvement of sex steroid hormones in most of the sex differences in cannabinoid - induced behavioral effects has been already put forward and appears to be the more likely explanation ( gonzlez et al . , 2000 ;
the authors demonstrated that early exposure to cannabinoids masculinizes social play in females without altering this behavior in males . the likely cellular mechanism for this sexual differentiation of the developing brain and behavior might be the regulation of cell proliferation and cell type in the developing amygdala . on the basis of these observations
a different approach was employed to assess cb1 receptor / g protein coupling , namely autoradiographic analysis on brain sections in mateos study and binding studies on membrane samples from brain tissue in the burston s one .
moreover , when acute cannabinoid effects are taken into account it would be very useful also to discriminate among the different female hormonal status . as a whole these data will help to better understand the therapeutic possibilities of the endocannabinoid system and to better exploit them , perhaps in a sex - dependent manner .
