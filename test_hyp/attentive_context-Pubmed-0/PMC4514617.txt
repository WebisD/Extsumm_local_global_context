to get an idea of how the studied stacks contributed to further contamination of the environment , we compared the annual discharged activities with the activities of an area of soil surface contaminated by fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests ( in the case of pu also from snap-9a satellite burn - up ) .
taking into account the fact that at latitudes 40 to 50n the fallout of pu , pu and am till 1978 amounted to 58 , 1.5 and 25 bq.m , respectively , the largest annual discharge of pu 670 bq in 20042009 ( stack 4 in 2008 ) is equivalent to the fallout of these radionuclides on an area of 11.6  m , in the case of pu the equivalent area ( maximum discharge 1,800 bq , stack 3 in 2007 ) is 1,200 m and in the case of am ( maximum discharge 87000 bq , stack 8 , 2006 ) this area is 3,480  m. it is evident that even the stacks with the largest annual discharges contribute to further contamination of the environment only to a very small degree .
up to 2003 we had searched for tru in effluents discharged to air from five stacks ( stacks 1 and 2 of the former v1 and v2 , npp jaslovsk bohunice , stacks 3 and 4 , of the former v3 and v4 , npp dukovany and stack 5 of npp temelin ) . at four of these stacks
