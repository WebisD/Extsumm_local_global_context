response curve for iop lowering , with an optimal concentration between 0.25% and 0.5%.32 removal of bak from 0.5% timolol ophthalmic solution formulations could reduce timolol bioavailability enough to achieve a concentration that optimizes intraocular efficacy.32 this literature review aims to explain the findings of the phase iii study demonstrating enhanced efficacy of bim / tim pf over preserved bim / tim by exploring the relationship between the concentration of timolol in preserved ophthalmic solutions and its iop - lowering efficacy .
timolol significantly lowered iop in healthy volunteers and in patients with oag , and in dose ranging studies , the maximum effect appeared to occur with the 0.5% concentration.69 the current knowledge of the dose 
pf formulations have demonstrated noninferior or equivalent efficacy to their respective preserved formulations , with potential for a reduced incidence of ocular adverse events.1322 bimatoprost / timolol ( bim / tim ) ophthalmic solution ( ganfort ; allergan plc , irvine , ca , usa ) is a fixed - combination formulation of bimatoprost 0.03% ( a synthetic prostamide ) and timolol 0.5% ( a nonselective -adrenergic receptor antagonist ) preserved with bak.23 clinical trials have demonstrated that when dosed once daily , the fixed combination produces greater iop reduction than each of the active components dosed as monotherapy.24,25 accordingly , bim / tim is used in a number of countries worldwide to treat patients with primary oag ( poag ) or ocular hypertension ( oht ) who do not reach target iop with monotherapy . however , because of the increasing awareness of patient sensitivity to preservatives , bim / tim pf ( allergan plc , irvine , ca , usa ) was developed ; this pf formulation is identical to the original bim / tim formulation , except for the removal of 50 ppm of bak . in a 12-week , multicenter , randomized , phase iii study of 561 patients with oag or oht ,
