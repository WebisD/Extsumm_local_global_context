a very thin woman with a diagnosis of sma syndrome was prepared for surgery after having failed medical therapy .
it provides definitive treatment while preserving the benefits of minimally invasive surgical techniques in the debilitated patient .
the patient was placed in a supine position , and four laparoscopic ports were required to perform a 5 cm duodenojejunostomy .
we report the first case of laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy as the definitive treatment of vascular compression of the duodenum .
superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) syndrome is a rare disorder , recognized as weight loss , nausea , vomiting , and post - prandial pain due to compression and partial obstruction of the third portion of the duodenum by the sma .
vascular compression of the duodenum was first described by rokitansky in 1842 , with the first successful operative treatment , a duodenojejunostomy , performed by stavely in 1908 .
if conservative treatment fails , then laparotomy with duodenojejunostomy or lysis of the ligament of treitz is indicated .
, we describe the first known case of laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy for superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) syndrome .
laparoscopic treatment via duodenojejunostomy is safe and effective and may offer patients the benefit of decreased pain , hospital stay , and postoperative disability .
