we concluded that iranian bark of juglone , regiolane , has the antibacterial effects against the important oral bacteria , and ethanolic extract was of higher effectivity against tested bacteria than aqueous extract .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of juglans regia bark against four species of oral bacteria .
, we indicated that the high concentrations of ethanolic and aqueous extracts have had antimicrobial effects against s. sanguis , s. mutans , s. salivarius , and staphylococcus aureus with significant difference in contrast to control .
also the results were shown that ethanolic extracts were significant ( p < 0.0001 ) with inhibitory effect on the growth of four tested bacteria , in contrast to negative control ( table 2 ) .
aqueous extract had significantly antibacterial effect against staphylococcus aureus , s. salivarius ( figure 2 ) , and s. sanguis ( figure 4 ) compared to control and was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) , but it did not show effect on s. mutans when compared with erythromycin .
the mic was evaluated for the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of juglans regia on bacteria and the results were shown in table 3 . according to the obtained mic values , ethanol extract of juglans regia bark
