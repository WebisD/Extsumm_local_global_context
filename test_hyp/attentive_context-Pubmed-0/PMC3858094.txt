in current pcl studies , there has been a shift in biomechanics from reciprocal functioning to co - dominance .
the remnants of pcl fibers , placement of the femoral tunnel , and combined plri are other hot issues in reconstruction . after the reconstruction of the pcl , a more active and systemic exercise program and early weight - bearing training are increasingly being recognized as important .
surgical devices and reconstructive techniques of the pcl have been developing and a more active approach is used than the past .
understanding the biomechanics of the native pcl provides a framework for reconstruction by replicating the anatomy.15 ) early biomechanical studies characterized the rehabilitationindividual main bundles of the pcl as anterolateral ( al ) and posteromedial ( pm ) bundles.16,17 ) the al bundle is more taut in flexion and more lax in extension ; the reverse is true for the pm bundle , which is more taut in extension and more lax in flexion.17,18 ) in this setting , the al and pm bundles mainly function individually at the flexed and extended positions , respectively . however , more recent biomechanical studies have suggested that , based on length and spatial orientation , the two bundles of the pcl may have a co - dominant relationship rather than a reciprocal one.15,19 - 21 ) this concept means that both bundles function through the range of motion ( rom ) in a synergistic fashion rather than a reciprocal one .
