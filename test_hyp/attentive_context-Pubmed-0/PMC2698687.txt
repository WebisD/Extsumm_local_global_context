we report a patient with purtschers - like retinopathy following childbirth who received a sub - tenon s capsule injection of triamcinolone with subsequent increase in visual acuity and decrease in retinal swelling .
first described in 1910 , purtscher s retinopathy is seen in severely traumatized patients and is characterized by sudden visual loss ( purtscher 1912 ) .
the case presented here is unique in that the patient had bilateral , asymmetric purtschers - like retinopathy post - partum , with quantitative oct improvement following unilateral local steroid therapy .
however , there are encouraging reports of visual recovery in patients with purtscher s retinopathy receiving high dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy ( atabay et al 2003 ) .
similar clinical findings have been reported in association with childbirth ( blodi et al 1990 ; shaikh et al 2003 ) , and have been termed purtschers - like retinopathy . the visual prognosis in purtschers - like retinopathy after childbirth is guarded , and to date , there is no definitive treatment .
another case of purtscher - like retinopathy has been described in a patient with hellp syndrome during antepartum .
nearly a century ago otmar purtscher described a case of visual loss in a severely traumatized patient whose exam showed multiple superficial retinal hemorrhages and white patches throughout the posterior pole . since that time , similar findings have been associated with other conditions including compressive chest injuries , acute pancreatitis , fat embolism , retro - bulbar anesthesia , connective tissue diseases ( grass 1997 ) , and childbirth ( blodi et al 1990 ; shaikh et al 2003 ) .
