thus , in this case , pituitary prolactinoma may have caused the chronic anovulatory cycle and indirectly led to the development of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma .
a nulliparous 44-year - old woman with a 10-year history of irregular menstrual cycles presented with massive abnormal uterine bleeding , shortness of breath , and exhaustion .
levels of serum prolactin have remained stable and no evidence of recurrent endometrial carcinoma has been identified during follow - up . in conclusion , hyperprolactinemia indirectly induces endometrioid endometrial carcinoma after causing chronic anovulation . in patients with irregular menstruation and chronic anovulation that may be attributable to hyperprolactinemia , exploration of both the hypophysis and endometrium
the utility of correcting hyperprolactinemia using dopamine agonists for the purpose of preventing the development of endometrial carcinoma has yet to be determined . in the present case ,
galactorrhea is rare for both postmenopausal women and men ( and is also relatively rarer than hypogonadism in premenopausal women ) , so symptoms due to tumor growth such as headache or visual field loss can represent chances for diagnosis in postmenopausal women or men . herein , we present the case of a 44-year - old nulliparous woman who had experienced irregular menstruation cycles for about 10 years and developed both pituitary prolactinoma and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma . in premenopausal women
