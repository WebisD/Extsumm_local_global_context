the structure of cell membranes , we mean the detailed arrangement and conformation of the individual proteins , lipids , oligosaccharides and other components of membranes  and concluded that  we are a very long way from such knowledge at the present time .
 there is no doubt that tremendous progresses have been made in this direction , and our current view on membrane organization has been in the last decade deeply influenced by the lipid raft hypothesis . the lipid raft hypothesis had the great merit to re - focus the researcher 's attention on the importance of lipids , and in particular on the importance of collective properties of a cellular lipid environment , in determining membrane organization , and to root the notion that membrane order is highly dynamic and changing .
detergent - resistant membrane preparations might reflect the properties of lipid rafts in living cells ( sonnino and prinetti , 2008 ) , however they are undoubtedly systems driven to equilibrium by the specific experimental conditions used for detergent extraction systems . to understand the dynamics ( in time and space ) of phase separation - driven domains in living cells we still miss adequate experimental tools , even if the first pieces of information in this direction have been recently provided .
