the aim of the study was therefore to assess the amount of blood loss and the number of units of whole blood required for oral and maxillofacial procedures and also to evaluate any relationship between the amount of blood loss and duration of surgery .
when the teg results for the two groups were compared , there was significant association between clot formation time , maximum clot firmness , and alpha angle , but the fibrinolytic resistance of blood clot was not related to intraoperative blood loss and they concluded that alpha angle greater than 67 degrees was suggestive of blood loss of 400  mls or less with 95% certainty , but such predictions may not reflect actual values .
isolated unilateral cleft lip had the lowest mean value of estimated blood loss of 10.4  ( 10.8 )  mls and also the lowest duration of surgery of 58 ( 76 )  mins .
linear regression analysis was used to analyze the association between blood loss and duration of surgery .
eipe and ponniah   opined that differences in pre- and postoperative haematocrit values and deductions of blood loss by the gross formula are invaluable ; the formula stated that actual blood loss equals blood volume multiplied by the difference in pre- ( initial ) and postoperative ( final ) hematocrit values and divided by mean of both hematocrit values ; blood volume was calculated by multiplying body weight in kilograms by 70  ml / kg ; however , the values are usually difficult to correlate with exact intraoperative loss due to intraoperative blood transfusion and crystalloid infusions as well as postoperative blood losses / fluid dilutions
