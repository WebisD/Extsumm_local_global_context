this conclusion is strongly supported by the lack of autoimmune manifestations and changes in thymocyte maturation upon foxn1-cre  mediated ablation of a conditional foxp3 allele in the thymic epithelium . in contrast , in control experiments , foxp3 ablation in the t cell lineage resulted in lethal autoimmune pathology typical of germline foxp3 mutation , as previously reported . in full agreement with these data
are the results of the bm transfer experiments , which showed that foxp3 deficiency in hematopoietic cells is solely responsible for autoimmunity , and that perturbed thymocyte subsets in foxp3-deficient mice are an indirect consequence of pathology .
recently , apparent expression of foxp3 in the majority of thymic epithelial cells was observed in experiments using flow cytometry while a subset of thymic cortical epithelial cells was found positive for foxp3 by immunofluorescence ( 16 ) .
disruption of foxp3 in the t cell lineage is necessary and sufficient to cause autoimmune syndrome .
collectively , our data demonstrates that the thymic epithelium does not express detectable amounts of foxp3 protein , and that there are no measurable adverse effects on immunological tolerance attributable to foxp3 deficiency in thymic stromal cells or in other radiation - resistant nonhematopoietic cells .
