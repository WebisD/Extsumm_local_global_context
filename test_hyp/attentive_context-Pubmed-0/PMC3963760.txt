, controversy surrounds the putative cellular sources of postnatal cardiomyogenesis : do new myocytes arise from proliferation of pre - exisiting ones or from cardiomyogenic differentiation of endogenous progenitors ? in this review , we will present the evidence supporting the contribution of these two mechanisms in adult cardiomyogenesis and discuss their relative importance in different settings , such as normal ageing and post - myocardial injury .
cardiomyogenesis ( generation of cardiomyocytes ) had not been convincingly demonstrated in the adult mammalian heart until very recently ; the potential for myocardial regeneration was only recognized in organisms such as fish and amphibians .
we will also critically present the existing methodologies that allowed the investigation of these mechanisms , with emphasis on their strengths and limitations .
although the various studies do not agree about the rate of cardiomyocyte renewal in adults , this is clearly low and inadequate to replenish the substantial losses of cells after major injuries such as a myocardial infarction . in addition
cell therapies have already reached the stage of clinical trials ; most of the cells currently under investigation ( with the exception of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells ) do not differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes and act through paracrine activation of endogenous reparative and regenerative pathways .
