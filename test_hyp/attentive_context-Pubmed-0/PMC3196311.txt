the in vivo effects of st28 were also evaluated using flow cytometry and real - time pcr in dextran - sodium - sulphate- ( dss- ) induced colitis mice , a human ibd model in which il-17 plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis .
the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral administration of st28 on il-17 production by murine lamina propria lymphocytes ( lpls ) and on the expression of th17-related surface markers in inflamed intestines .
although the efficacy of this treatment approach was demonstrated for ulcerative colitis , the results for crohn 's disease are not yet clear owing to conflicting results and a paucity of trials . in any case , the majority of the demonstrated curative and palliative effects of probiotic bacteria appear to be mediated by modulation of the intestinal immune system .
we first evaluated and compared in vitro cytokine production patterns in th17-skewed conditions following the exposure of splenocytes to st28 and atcc 19258 ( type strain ) .
clinical approaches using probiotics are appealing due to a lack of toxicity and patient desire for the use of natural physiological approaches to treating disease . since s. thermophilus has a long history of being safely consumed in yogurt , its further application to the treatment and/or prevention of th17-mediated diseases such as ibd
