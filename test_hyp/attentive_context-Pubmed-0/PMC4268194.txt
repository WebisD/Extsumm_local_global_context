furthermore , we showed poor correlation between tramadol ingested dose , tibtiha , pco2 , and seizure in tramadol - intoxicated cases .
the results showed that there were significant differences between cases with seizure and cases without seizure according to time interval between tramadol ingestion and hospital admission ( tibtiha ) ( mean  se ) ( 330.3  53.2 vs. 257.3  30.1 min , p = 0.01 ) , ingested dose ( mean  se ) ( 1395.7  218.3 vs. 2500.7  390.7 mg , p = 0.006 ) , with odds ratio 2.7 ( 1.03 - 7.09 , 95% confidence interval [ ci ] ) , dizziness ( 3 cases vs. 23 cases , p = <
0.0001 ) , with odds ratio 0.1 ( 0.29 - 0.36 , 95% ci ) , pco2 ( 51.2  8.5 vs. 48.4  8.6 mmhg , p = 0.03 ) , with odds ratio 0.58 ( 0.27 - 1.24 , 95% ci ) , and total bilirubin ( 0.5  0.2 vs. 0.7  0.4 mg / dl , p = 0.002 ) . there was a correlation between ingested dose ( r = 0.2 , p = 0.006 ) , paco2 ( r = 0.2 , p = 0.03 ) , tibtiha ( r = 0.2 , p = 0.01 ) , total bilirubin ( r = 0.3 , p = 0.002 ) , dizziness ( r = 0.3 , p = 0.000 ) , and seizure .
