growing evidence indicates that the pathological manifestations of chronic stress include neuronal and synaptic atrophy / malfunction as well as immunosuppression , but our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms is still poor and calls for more research not only to identify therapeutic inroads but , also , preventative measures or ways to delay onset of disease .
clinical and preclinical studies suggest that chronic stress / elevated gc levels may be an etiological factor in the development and progression of both ad and pd pathologies .
we discuss some of current knowledge about cellular targets and mechanisms through which stress and altered gc levels trigger changes in the brain that may lead towards the development and progression of neurodegenerative pathologies such as alzheimer 's ( ad ) and parkinson ( pd ) disease .
both vulnerability and resilience may be determined by genetic and epigenetic ( gene environmental interactions ) background   . since the discovery of the communication between hypothalamus and pituitary in early 70s that opens a new window in our understanding of the brain - body communication , there are plethora of studies describing the high biological significance of stress and its responses which enables various adaptive processes to changing conditions .
