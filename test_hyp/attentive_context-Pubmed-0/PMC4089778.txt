, it has not been used in clinical practice . our poor morphologic results with the use this method prompted us to perform microangiography of the newly constructed part of the ureter with this method to definitively resolve the problem of neovascularization in this area .
the present animal study suggests that the surgical ureteral reconstruction using this method or grafted tissue is not suitable to achieve clinically desirable results .
this method has been in use for about 50 years . despite previous reports describing the benefits of this method , in reconstructive surgery , up to now
one of the methods of partial ureter substitution is the use of free bladder autologous mucosa flaps .
all animals were operated on in the same manner ( figure 1 ) , with general endotracheal anesthesia . after grafting ,
the experiments were carried out on 29 mongrel dogs , as previously described   .
the defects in the ureters were not bridged by the smooth muscle   .
it should be noted that the results of our previous studies   and of the present study do not support a free bladder mucosa flap as a viable clinical therapy for ureteral reconstruction , in spite of the positive reports of the above - mentioned authors .
