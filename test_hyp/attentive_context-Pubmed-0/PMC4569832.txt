finally , it is also important 
 to understand the behaviour of mosquitoes that are used in the most modern and promising 
 control techniques , such as those infected with the bacteria wolbachia 
 and genetically modified mosquitoes .
the determination of the average and maximum 
 number of breeding sites that were used by each female can aid in the development of 
 methodologies for monitoring and controlling the vector .
noted that 87% of females used one to four breeding sites , with a maximum of seven . in 
 our study , the number of containers that were used by the females increased following 
 the increased availability of breeding sites under both laboratory and semi - field 
 conditions .
it was demonstrated for the first time that the behavioural response of females depended 
 on the resources ( number of breeding sites ) that were provided to them . in an experiment 
 with eight available containers , chadee ( 2010 ) 

this result is probably due to the duration of 
 the tests , which were performed between the third - seventh day after the consumption of 
 blood meal , during which the females laid almost all of the eggs that were produced 
 ( gomes 2006 , reiter 2007 , chadee 2010 ) .
