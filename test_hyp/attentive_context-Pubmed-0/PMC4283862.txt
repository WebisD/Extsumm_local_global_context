the study groups included patients after pp ( group i , n = 30 ) , a control group ( group ii , n = 33 ) , and patients without pp who received posterior pericardial tubes ( the tube was placed behind the heart and sutured to the adjacent pericardial tissue to avoid tube - induced ventricular arrhythmias ) ( group iii , n = 33 ) .
this study aims to investigate the effects of posterior pericardiotomy ( pp ) on the development of pericardial effusion , tamponade , and atrial fibrillation following cas .
in conclusion , pp may be a useful technique in the prevention of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade after cas because it is simple , safe , and effective .
severe pericardial effusion was detected in one patient ( group ii , n = 1 ) on the first postoperative day , in one patient ( group iii , n = 1 ) on the fifth postoperative day , and in one patient ( group iii , n = 1 ) on the 30 postoperative day .
the incidence of cardiac tamponade was higher in group ii ( n = 4 , 12% ) , and the differences between the groups were statistically significant ( p = 0.019 ) .
