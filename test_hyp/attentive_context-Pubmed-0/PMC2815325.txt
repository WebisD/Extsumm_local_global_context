our data demonstrated that lkn-1/ccl15 enhanced mmp-9 protein release from human macrophages and macrophage - derived foam cells , indicating that lkn-1/ccl15 may be associated with the vulnerability of plaque rupture in the late stage of atherosclerosis .
the present study has demonstrated that lkn-1/ccl15 enhances mmp-9 protein release by macrophages and macrophages - derived foam cells , indicating that lkn-1/ccl15 may play a role in the plaque rupture of the atherosclerotic lesions .
therefore , it can be postulated that macrophages and macrophage - derived foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions may enhance the local concentration of lkn-1 in the lesions , and lkn-1/ccl15 subsequently stimulate the macrophages / foam cells per se to secrete mmp-9 , indicating that lkn-1/ccl15 action on macrophages and foam cells to release mmp-9 may contribute to plaque destabilization in the progression of atherosclerosis . in conclusion , lkn-1/ccl15 enhanced mmp-9 protein secretion from thp-1 monocytic cells - derived macrophages , human pbmc - derived macrophages , and thp-1 macrophage - derived foam cells in a dose dependent manner . considering the association of mmp-9 in plaque rupture , our findings suggest that lkn-1/ccl15 could be associated with plaque destabilization in the progression of atherosclerosis . lkn-1/ccl15 may be a useful target for the management of atherosclerosis .
