assessing c. jejuni survival in an acidified medium , we found the highest bacterial survival in co - cultures where c. jejuni were added after the addition of acidic media . in that study we found that the acid milieu triggered c. jejuni motility and uptake into the amoebae .
amoebae associated c. jejuni in milk and juice survived better than free bacteria both at room temperature and at 4c , but a. polyphaga could not protect the bacteria from pasteurization .
however , in milk stored at 4c the bacterial survival at 24 h was not significantly affected by co - culture with amoebae and at 48 h , c. jejuni incubated alone ( treatment c ) actually survived better than in co - culture .
the survival curves for c. jejuni in treatment a were characterized by an increase in bacterial concentration at the beginning of the experiments ( 3 and 6 h ) .
we found significantly higher bacterial survival in co - cultures compared to when c. jejuni were incubated alone ( treatment c ) . in both products and at both temperatures , the highest survival was found in co - cultures where c. jejuni were added to a. polyphaga before the addition of the product ( treatment a ) .
