this study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of dabigatran and warfarin around dccv in terms of stroke prevention , time taken to get to dccv , and the success of cardioversion in achieving sinus rhythm .
the use of dabigatran in comparison with warfarin facilitated earlier dccv with a lower probability of rescheduling due to inadequate anticoagulation .
a retrospective study of sequential patients referred for elective dccv to basingstoke and north hampshire hospital over 12  months running from september 2013 to september 2014 .
the majority of the referred patients ( 96 patients ; 89.7% ) had a low cha2ds2vasc score of between 0 and 3 , while only 10.3% ( 11 out of 107 ) had a cha2ds2vasc score of between 4 and 9 . for patients receiving dabigatran ,
week review following dccv , the overall success rate was 57% ( 61 patients out of 107 ) , and the proportion of patients who failed to maintain sinus rhythm was 46 out of 107 ( 43% ) .
there were a high number of dabigatran patients receiving dccv within 45  days compared to warfarin , which indicates that dabigatran can be associated with more rapid dccv and a shorter af.table  2analysis of patients who received direct current cardioversion within 45  days and outcome ; patients with background of heart failure and outcomecategorynumber of patientssuccess rate
