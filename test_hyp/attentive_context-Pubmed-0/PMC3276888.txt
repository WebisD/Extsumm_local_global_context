this study was aimed at evaluating the morphometric parameters of papillary dermal vessels in psoriasis and to compare these with psoriasiform lesions .
photomicrograph demonstrating the dermal vessels in psoriasis ( a , lsab , 200 ) and psoriasiform dermatitis ( b , lsab 200 ) morphometric analysis showed that length density of microvessels was significantly higher in psoriasis ( 3.731.45 mm ) compared to psoriasiform lesions ( 2.991.99 mm , p value 0.03 ) .
the present study demonstrates significant difference in the papillary dermal vasculature between psoriatic skin and psoriasiform dermatitis . these results , which need to be confirmed in further larger studies ,
in this study , skin biopsies from 25 cases of psoriasis and 25 of psoriasiform lesions were included .
microvessel density , i.e. , number of vessels per unit dermal area , was also higher in psoriasis ( 71.2840.05 ) than psoriasiform lesions ( 62.732.03 ) , though the difference was not statistically significant .
the diagnosis of psoriasis was confirmed on the basis of clinical features ( pink to red papules with fine silvery scales and positive auspitz sign ) in conjunction with characteristic histologic changes .
in contrast to these parameters , the ratio of microvessel area to papillary dermal area was similar in psoriasis ( 0.130.07 ) and psoriasiform lesions ( 0.140.11 ) [ table 1 ] . comparative analysis of dermal microvasculature in psoriasis and psoriasiform dermatitis these three morphometric vascular parameters are depicted in scatter plots [ figures 3a  c ] .
