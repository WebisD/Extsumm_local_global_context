we first derive the form of regression calibration estimators for the extended rciv1 model , which includes interactions between unobservable predictors and observable covariates , and derive asymptotic standard errors for all estimators in this model using the delta method .
this difference in interaction terms ( i.e. , the three - way interaction ) suggests a complex relationship between exposure to pollutants and cold status of children with asthma , with respect to lte4 levels .
we then revisit the air pollution and health data to better understand the role of uris in the health - exposure relationship .
, we examined the relationship between a biomarker of inflammation , leukotriene e4 ( lte4 ) , and two instrumental variables related to pollutant exposures : urinary cotinine ( related to shs exposure ) and outdoor fine particulate matter ( related to personal ambient fine particulate matter exposure ) , plus their interaction . using these instrumental variables plus a small number of days of measured - with - error but unbiased exposure concentrations from personal monitors ( the unbiased surrogate variables )
the extended models presented in this paper allowed us to examine this , and could be used to study other potential effect modifiers . in this paper ,
