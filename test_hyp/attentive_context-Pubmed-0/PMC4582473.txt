this method of soft tissue reconstruction is a necessary skill for surgeons involved with the implantation of knee endoprostheses .
a secure and stable coverage with soft tissue is a basic requirement for good short - term and long - term results regarding the prosthesis . without a sufficient coverage with vital soft tissue with a good blood supply ,
the demands on a long lifetime of the prostheses are consistently increasing due to the increasing life expectancy of the patients receiving prostheses . standardizations in endoprosthetics , increased experience of surgeons and the further development of prostheses has led to the consistent improvement of long - term results and lifetime of artificial joints ,   so that prostheses are implanted and replaced in younger patients as well .
the gastrocnemius muscle flap is a good method for secure coverage of the prosthesis with well - perfused tissue . despite the high rate of complications of almost 35% which required at least another surgery ,
wound healing defects and associated soft tissue damages are becoming more important in the orthopedic practice .
transcutaneous measurements of oxygenation have shown that the level of oxygenation near the surgical scar necessary for wound healing is only reached after two to three days [ .
