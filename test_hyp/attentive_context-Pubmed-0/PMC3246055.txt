based on all of the available evidence , neurogenesis is still a most controversial issue in studies of neurodegenerative diseases and their animal models . in mptp animal models for pd , we have demonstrated that mptp destroys a cells in the svz and ob in the adult brain and then transiently impairs neurogenesis ; however , it remains to be investigated whether and how multiple potential neural stem cells migrate into the nigrostriatal system and replace the lost dopaminergic neurons . with increased attention to dopaminergic neurogenesis in neurotoxin - induced animal models for pd , it is expected that the models will become useful as tools for understanding the mechanisms for neurogenesis in pd and that many questions regarding neurogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases will be resolved .
the replacement of lost neurons in a damaged brain area is the best direction for therapeutic development in relation to neurodegenerative diseases .
this review will provide the body of evidence available for endogenous neurogenesis in response to neurotoxin damage in animal models of pd .
in addition to fetal nigral transplantation , the capability of self - repair in the central nervous system ( cns ) in the adult mammalian has also given a new perspective in the cell - based approach for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders .
