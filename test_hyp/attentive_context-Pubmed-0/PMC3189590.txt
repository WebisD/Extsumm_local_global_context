the effect of ppar ligands on human pancreatic fibroblastoid cells in vitro and a potential for adipogenic differentiation were investigated .
ppar appears to be a central regulator in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation . while ppar ligands have been shown to inhibit culture activation of psc and maintain a more quiescent state in freshly isolated cells , overexpression of ppar itself in immortalized pscs inhibits proliferation and reduces collagen synthesis . in this study , we describe the ultrastructural morphology of human pancreatic fibroblastoid cells isolated by outgrowth from human pancreatic tissue samples in comparison to rat pancreatic stellate cells .
thiazolidinediones , antidiabetic drugs , and synthetic ligands of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppar ) have been shown to inhibit the activation of psc in vitro , and in animal models , ppargamma ligands have been shown to ameliorate the development of chronic pancreatitis   .
investigation of ppar gene expression in human tissues   revealed a maximum of ppar 1 and 2 expression in human fat tissue , and to a lower extent in liver , heart , and muscle .
in addition , we were able to show a reduction of collagen synthesis by ppar ligands , arguing for reversibility of the activation process .
