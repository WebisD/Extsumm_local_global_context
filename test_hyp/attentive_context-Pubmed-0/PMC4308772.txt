the causes of dyslexia are poorly understood , but have been linked to damage to a reading - specific brain region in the left hemisphere known as the visual speech area . in this study , we describe a case of delayed encephalopathy with digit and letter alexia following carbon monoxide poisoning .
carbon monoxide poisoning is the fourth most common type of poisoning in china , and is a leading cause of neurological disturbances .
a less complicated and less extensive brain network is involved in the reading of numbers and letters compared with that involved in reading chinese words , so less compensation may be seen after injury .
general patient information the patient was diagnosed with delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide poisoning .
the psychiatric and neurological symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache , muscle weakness , drowsiness , memory disturbances , apraxia , delirium , speech disorder , epileptic seizure , ataxia , and symptoms of parkinsonism .
functional mri revealed activation of a wide area including left inferior / middle frontal gyri , bilateral medial frontal gyri , posterior inferior temporal area , bilateral middle occipital / fusiform gyri , and the bilateral cerebellum during chinese letter reading .
