apolt was initially performed in patients with acute liver failure and non - cirrhotic metabolic liver disease to compensate for enzyme deficiencies without complete removal of the native liver and for small - for - size living donor grafts [ 3 - 5 ] .
urea cycle disorders ( ucd ) are among the most common inborn errors of metabolism of the liver .
our patient was a 27-year - old man who was diagnosed with adult - onset type ii citrullinemia ( ctln2 ) at age 24 .
apolt was initially introduced as a temporary or permanent support for patients with fulminant hepatic failure .
citrullinemia can be classified into three types : neonatal / infantile ( types i and iii ) and the adult form ( type ii ) .
this procedure can be carried out to overcome the limitations of graft volume in living donor liver transplantation . in korea ,
how much volume of graft can be transplanted successfully is questionable in cases of inborn error of metabolism , such as ucd .
more than 20 patients with citrullinemia have undergone liver transplantation , with favorable therapeutic results . however , the number of cases with auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation ( apolt ) is limited .
