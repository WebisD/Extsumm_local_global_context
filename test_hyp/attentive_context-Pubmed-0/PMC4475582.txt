the postoperative behavior of the meningioma was followed and an effort was made to assess whether tumor 's location , histopathological subtype , and the extent of surgical resection were predictive factors for recurrence .
objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of atypical and malignant meningiomas and estimate their effect on recurrence , morbidity , and mortality .
radical tumor excision is the most effective treatment , as it determines the patient outcome , and it should always be applied . in cases of subtotal resection , radiotherapy should be applied , as it seems to delay tumor 's reappearance .
atypical and malignant meningiomas appear to be distinct entities with poor prognosis , despite the surgical intervention .
three - year survival rate was 66.6% for atypical meningiomas , 33.3% for malignant meningiomas , and 86.3% for patients with grade
patients with grade ii resection ( complete resection with coagulation of the dura ) presented recurrence at 49% and grade iii ( complete resection of tumor , without coagulation of the dura or removal of affected sinus or bone ) patients recurred at a percentage of 67% , while 100% of grade iv and v patients developed tumor enlargement . the extent of surgical tumor removal was significantly associated with recurrence ( p < 0.001 ) .
