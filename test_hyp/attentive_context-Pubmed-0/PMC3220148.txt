the treatment challenge in this type of injury is to promote a complete oral rehabilitation in both esthetics and function .
hypoplasia is defined as a quantitative defect of enamel visually and is histomorphologically identified as an external defect involving the surface of the enamel and associated with reduced thickness of enamel .
hypoplasia is a disturbance that occurs at the time when teeth are developing and is associated with macroscopic enamel defects .
unlike other abnormalities which affect a vast number of teeth , turner 's hypoplasia usually affects only one tooth in the mouth and it is referred to as a turner 's tooth . if turner 's hypoplasia is found on a canine or a premolar , the most likely cause is an infection that was present when the primary tooth was still in the mouth .
the need for close periodic examination and early detection of all possible developmental defects in the permanent dentition and the importance on preventive measures should be stressed for maintaining the vitality of the tooth . since information on the microstructural level of enamel hypoplasia is still limited , further studies to be conducted to better understand the mechanisms behind non - vitality .
