the zona pellucida birefringence ( zpb ) and zona pellucida thickness ( zpt ) of fertilized oocytes were observed non - invasively to explore the effect of hmg on the development of zona pellucida .
in conclusion , hmg supplement did not elicit evident effects on normal - responsive patients except fertilization and zpb and zpt of oocytes .
the endometrial thickness and average number of transplanted embryos were comparable between r - fsh group and r - fsh+ hmg group ( 11.720.31 vs. 11.180.26 , p=0.19 ; 2.200.05 vs. 2.240.05 , p=0.59 ; respectively ) .
the average amount of r - fsh , endometrial thickness , number of retrieved oocytes , and mature rate in the r - fsh+ hmg group were not different from those in the r - fsh group ; this result is similar to those in the previous reports ( 5 , 6 ) .
the present study was designed to understand the effect of hmg on the total consumption of fsh , oocyte yield , fertilization rate , pregnancy , and implantation rate in gnrha long - protocol treatment .
however , d0zpt and d1zpt of r - fsh group were respectively lower than those of r - fsh+ hmg group ( 18.750.10 vs. 19.200.14 , p=0.01 ; 18.170.14 vs. 18.690.12 , p=0.00 ) when the zpt of the fertilized oocytes were further analyzed at 6 or 20 hr after insemination on d0 or d1 .
