this paper briefly describes the methodology essential for conducting studies on the association between lycopene and prostate cancer incidence and provides an updated review of studies of lycopene and tomato products with prostate cancer risk .
the study of this relationship has been complicated by unique and challenging epidemiologic considerations in the measurement of lycopene and on the influence of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) screening on prostate cancer incidence and progression . as with all epidemiologic studies ,
these mechanistic studies have stimulated the examination of lycopene and its primary source , tomato products , on risk of prostate cancer .
however , studies on lycopene and tomato intake and prostate cancer incidence have yielded mixed results .
, it is becoming increasingly difficult to examine advanced stage prostate cancer , at least in some populations . examining potential mediators or markers of aggressive behavior in tumor tissue may be another useful approach in the further study of lycopene and prostate cancer risk .
several chemoprotective properties of lycopene on prostate cancer have been proposed , including potent antioxidant properties , decreased lipid oxidation , inhibition of cancerous cell proliferation at the g0-g1 cell cycle transition , and protection of lipoproteins and dna   .
