more recently , several authors have focused on oxo and carboxylato clusters of zirconium also as precursors for the corresponding nanostructured oxide.(29b ) in the present work , we used monothioacetic acid to coordinate zirconium ( added as butoxide ) , generating polynuclear clusters , with a behavior in some way related to what was observed with the homologue carboxylic acids that we employed in the past .
the described thio and oxothio clusters evidence as the well - established chemistry of the homologous oxo clusters ( based on omo bonds ) can actually be extended to the sulfur - based species , and polynuclear clusters in which both smo and sms bridges are present can be obtained .
nature of the chosen ligand , bearing both sulfido and oxo teeth , is the presence of concurring equilibria , involving monothioacetic acid and accounting for the presence in solution of monothio- and dithioacetate species which could all be detected in the three different structures , as well as the presence of both sulfido and oxo bridges . in the homologue oxo clusters the ligands , both chelating and bridging , are in all cases carboxylates , and the bridges
the obtained results and structures contribute to shedding light on the already outlined complex chemistry of these systems and also to triggering new research on further metals such as hafnium , titanium , and vanadium as well as on further ligands ( e.g. , dithioacetic acid , thiomethacrylic acid , etc . ) ,
