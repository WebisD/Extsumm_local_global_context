therefore , this study was undertaken to determine the profile and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of aerobic isolates from blood cultures of neonates in a tertiary care hospital in bijapur , india .
it is evident from this study that gram - negative organisms ( klebsiella , acinetobacter ) , cons , and s. aureus are the leading cause of neonatal sepsis in this study , and most of them are resistant to multiple antibiotics . therefore , the authors suggest that surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is necessary .
furthermore , we advise that health education be provided to the public on the dangers of indiscriminate use of antibiotics , which is currently considered to be a menace in our society and which has been responsible for the ineffectiveness of most commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin and ampicillin , as observed in our study .
out of 131 cases , 98 ( 74.8% ) had early - onset sepsis and 33 ( 25.2% ) had late - onset sepsis .
positive cases , there were 86 ( 65.5% ) male and 45 ( 34.5% ) female neonates with the male - to - female ratio of 1.9:1 .
during the study period , a total of 683 newborns with clinical sepsis were admitted .
