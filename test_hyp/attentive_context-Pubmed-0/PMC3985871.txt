on the basis of the conformation , 
 topology , and lipid and water 
 interactions of piv5 fpk4 in the four lipid membranes obtained from 
 solid - state nmr , we propose the following relations between the fp 
 structure and viral membrane fusion .
as the protein rearranges 
 its structure and hra forms a coiled - coil trimer in the prehairpin 
 intermediate , the fusion peptides of the three proteins interact in 
 the cell membrane to form a homotrimer .
, the piv5 
 fusion peptide mainly adopts a -strand conformation , similar 
 to its structure in neutral pc membranes , but the -strand is 
 inserted into the dope membrane rather than surface bound . moreover , 
 the peptide changes the phase behavior and hydration of the dope membrane . 

we 
 recently reported the first solid - state nmr structural study 
 of the piv5 fusion peptide in lipid bilayers .
we found that the peptide adopted an -helical conformation 
 in the negatively charged popc / popg membrane but a -strand 
 conformation on the surface of neutral popc and dmpc bilayers . in 
 the current study , we have determined the complete backbone conformation 
 of the popc / popg - bound piv5 fp using chemical shift constraints .
