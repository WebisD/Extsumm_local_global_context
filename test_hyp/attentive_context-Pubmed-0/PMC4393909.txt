the potential effect of treatment with incretins on the exocrine pancreas is also a controversial area for further research , as the relation between the exocrine and the endocrine pancreas represents a major field of investigation .
the present paper is aimed at reviewing findings of published studies investigating the prevalence of pei in diabetic patients and possible risk factors and mechanisms associated with its occurrence and severity .
the cases of patients with type i and type ii diabetes will be discussed separately , in view of possible different features and pathogenic mechanisms .
more recently , thanks also to the availability of a noninvasive test for pancreatic exocrine function , such as measurement of fecal elastase , several studies aimed at investigating the prevalence of pei in large cohorts of diabetic patients .
pancreas is a doubled - entity organ , with both an exocrine and an endocrine component , reciprocally interacting and closely cooperating for the digestion , absorption , and metabolism of oral nutrients .
future studies evaluating the influence of pert on glycemic control and insulin requirement should enroll a larger and more homogeneous population of diabetic patients , with treatment enduring for a longer period of time , and should also possibly evaluate the relation between pert and incretins profile . on the other hand ,
