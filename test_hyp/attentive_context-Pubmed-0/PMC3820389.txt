thus , this study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of application of 
 augmented reality - based otago exercise on the elderly for fall prevention and to provide 
 basal information .

 divided into an augmented reality - based otago exercise group , which included 10 subjects , 
 and an otago exercise group , which included 11 subjects ; exercise was performed for 12 
 weeks .
the bbs score showed a significant 
 increase , from a score of 47.605.36 before to a score of 53.702.50 ( p=0.000 ) after in the 
 augmented reality - based otago exercise group ; a significant difference , from a score of 
 48.914.53 to a score of 52.452.91 , was observed in the otago exercise group ( p=0.001 ) .
this research showed that augmented reality - based otago exercise is effective for improving 
 balance , gait , and falls efficacy of elderly women and that application of augmented 
 reality - based otago exercise is meaningful .
bmi , body mass index a total of 21 elderly women who voluntarily agreed to active participation were included in
