the development of this theory yielded a two - factor theory of confabulation consisting of the propensity to detailed imagination and defective source monitoring .
it was argued that the relationship between confabulation and language impairments may also be nonessential , but that confabulation may be on a continuum with thought disorder and , if this were the case , the inclusion of confabulation in a theory of delusions provides a possible starting point for relating research on delusions to research on language impairments in schizophrenia .
this paper has argued that theories that rely on defective belief evaluation and/or cognitive bias can not explain complex delusions , and that replacing these with confabulation solves this problem in a way that brings somatopsychotic and allopsychotic symptoms under one theory of delusions .
it was suggested that the two factors that lead to confabulation are due to reciprocal problems with interhemispheric communication consequent upon damage in inferior medial prefrontal region and that , as with delusions , memory and frontal executive dysfunction are not of primary aetiological relevance .
it will then be suggested that the new theory provides a natural explanation of why individuals with schizophrenia confabulate , and can inform the understanding the relationship between confabulation and thought disorder ( lorente - rovira , pomerol - clotet , mccarthy , berrios , & mckenna , 2007 ; nathaniel - james & frith , 1996 ) in a way that gives an early indication of how the gap between research on delusions and research on language impairments in schizophrenia might be bridged .
