the cancer detection rate was 32.8% and 34.4% in the lithotomy and lld positions , respectively ( p=0.941 ) .
patients who underwent trus - guided prostate biopsy in the lithotomy position experienced less pain than did those in the lld position , without a significant difference in the prostate cancer detection rate between the two positions .
, we retrospectively investigated the effect of the patient 's position ( lld vs. lithotomy position ) on pain perception during trus - guided prostate biopsy performed as an extended 12-core biopsy with the intrarectal administration of 2% lidocaine gel .
vas score showed a significant correlation with dm ( r=-0.141 , p=0.038 ) , psa level ( r=0.183 , p=0.019 ) , and lithotomy position ( r=-0.225 , p=0.011 ) ( fig .
we suggest that the lithotomy position is the proper way to perform trus - guided prostate biopsy to reduce the patient 's pain perception , especially in asian men .
vas score showed a significant correlation with lithotomy position ( =-0.772 , p=0.003 ) and dm ( =-0.803 , p=0.033 ) .
no statistically significant differences related to other clinical variables , including age , bmi , prostate volume , psa level , microscopic hematuria , pyuria , ipss , and dm , were observed between the lithotomy and lld positions .
