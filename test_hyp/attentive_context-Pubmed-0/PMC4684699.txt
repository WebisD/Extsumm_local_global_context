all the linkage maps described here are available from the pinus portal ( a european genetic and genomic resource for pinus ) through the pinusmap application ( https://w3.pierroton.inra.fr/pinusportal/index.php ) .
the following terms were used to describe the different kinds of genetic maps used in this study , as suggested by hudson et al .
the regression mapping algorithm of joinmap 4.1 ( van ooijen 2011 ) was used to produce two maps for each parental genotype ( one per cross ) , according to a two - way pseudotestcross mapping strategy ( grattapaglia and sederoff 1994 ) , using testcross markers ( i.e. , segregating in a 1:1 mendelian ratio ) only .
we carried out a literature review to identify previously published high - density gene - based linkage maps for members of the pinaceae family , for which sequence information was publicly available .
( 2012 ) : 1 ) sex - averaged map : a consensus map for both parents of a pedigree ; 2 ) consensus map : an integrated map based on segregation data from individual component maps ; 3 ) composite map : an integrated map of different individual component maps built by a marker - merging method ; and 4 ) component map : each of the maps used in the construction of a composite map .
