herein , we report a case of this rare intraoral variant in a 35-year - old male patient .
the characteristics of oral lesions tend to show few deviations from the classical oral lipoma , chiefly being the marked predilection for involvement of tongue and possibly bimodal age of onset and warrants reporting of such cases with detailed clinicopathological evaluation in future .
the buccal mucosa is the most affected intra oral site ; and lipomas and fibrolipomas are the most frequently observed histological types in the oral cavity . among the histopathological variants , lipomas with cartilaginous or osseous metaplasia , called chondrolipomas or osteolipomas respectively , have been described in the subcutaneous and deep soft tissues , particularly in the parosteal localization but are rare in the oral cavity . as per pubmed database , till date only 14 cases of chondrolipoma in oral cavity have been reported in english literature .
the cartilage found in the tumor most likely represents a metaplastic change or harmartomatous / choristomatous proliferation and could be attributed to multipotentiality of mesenchymal stem cells .
