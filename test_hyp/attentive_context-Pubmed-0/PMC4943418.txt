in conclusion , the incidence and severity of coagulopathy is maximum on the second postoperative day after donor hepatectomy . in donors with low bmi , planned for retrieval of right lobe of liver
number of donors with coagulopathy  first five consecutive postoperative days ( pod 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) after ldh on comparison of the subjects with coagulopathy ( group 1 : n = 84 ) with those without coagulopathy ( group 2 : n = 16 ) on the second postoperative day , a lower bmi ( 22.83  3.16 versus 25.42  2.72 ) , lower remnant liver volume ( remnant% 45.97  9.4 versus 58  15.32 , rmdwr 0.956  0.24 versus 1.16  0.30 ) , and longer duration of surgery ( 12.5  2.3 versus 10.8  2 hours ) was found in group 1 .
coagulopathy after major hepatic resection may compromise the donor 's safety , especially at epidural catheter removal . in the present study , we retrospectively analysed living donors who underwent hepatectomy ( ldh ) at our centre over a three year period ( march 2010 to 2013 ) .
, it may be prudent to remove the tec after the fifth postoperative day after confirming normal coagulation parameters , thereby decreasing the risk of complications associated with coagulopathy .
