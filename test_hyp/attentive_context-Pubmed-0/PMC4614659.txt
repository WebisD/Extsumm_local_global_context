congenital onychodystrophy ( co ) , also called as iso  kikuchi syndrome , was first described by iso in 1969 1 and later by kikuchi in 1974 2 as a clinical syndrome involving dysplasia / absence of fingernails with underlying bone abnormalities . since these first observations
pregnancy course was regular , except for maternal consumption of mebendazol at 5 weeks ' gestation to treat a pinworm infection .
nevertheless , clinical follow - up is needed in order to exclude other conditions associated with multisystem pathology ; a  complete family history may also be warranted to determine sporadic or hereditary transmission of such a condition .
more recently , several pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed for this condition : 

 selective abnormal fetal vascular supply from palmar digital artery causing in utero ischemic injury : the ischemic damage would mainly be seen on the radial side of the affected finger due to the smaller caliber of the artery on that side 15 , which should be more protected than the ulnar one;16 

 in utero dysplastic change in the crescent - shaped cap of the distal phalanx , a theory that would account for the frequent  y  shape of the dysplastic distal phalanx , when present;17 

 genetic mutations causing impairment of the wnt signaling pathway , an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development , growth regulation of multiple tissues , and cancer development;18 

 fetal exposure to teratogens , particularly antiepilectic drugs : phenytoin 19 , valproate , and carbamazepine20

  a literature research showed no proven association between the use of mebendazole during pregnancy and co. conversely , helminth infection during pregnancy is associated with poor cognitive and gross motor outcomes in infants , so that measures to prevent helminth infection during pregnancy should be reinforced;21 anthelminthic therapy is actually recommended in infected pregnant women , and it has been associated to a decreased rate of maternal anemia and low birth weight 22 .
