the survey demonstrated strong internal consistency , with reliability coefficients 0.85 for the total hfs - ii and subscales .
construct validity was additionally supported by the positive correlations between the hfs - ii and other valid measures of psychological distress , including anxiety and depression . as expected , higher hfs - ii scores were negatively related to quality of life , with the hfs - w subscale more strongly related to mental and emotional quality of life and the hfs - b subscale more strongly related to physical quality of life .
in addition , whereas hfs - w scores were more strongly related to lower quality of life in terms of emotional distress , hfs - b scores were more strongly related to lower quality of life in terms of physical burden and impairment .
in addition , hfs - b scores , but not hfs - w scores , were higher in patients with poorer glycemic control , indicative of more hyperglycemia .
hfs - b and hfs - w scores correlated negatively with health - related quality of life , including the sf-12 physical and mental scores . correlations and mean ( sd ) hfs - ii scores by measures of validity table 2 also shows that both hfs - b and hfs - w scores were significantly higher for those who had experienced severe hypoglycemia in the past year compared with those who had not [ f(1,281 ) = 8.956 , p = 0.003 and f(1,770 ) = 63.037 , p < 0.0005 , respectively ] , with effect sizes 0.35 for the hfs - b and 0.58 for the hfs - w .
