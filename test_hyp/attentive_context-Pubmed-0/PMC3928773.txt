the objective of this study was to verify , in vivo , the results 
 obtained from the kinematic kinetics , and electromyographic records in endodontists 
 during the preparation of simulated root canals using rotary and manual instrumentation 
 techniques .
based on the methodology used and the results obtained , it can be concluded that :   the angular displacement of the wrist and elbow during root canal preparation using 
 rotary and manual instruments were classified as low risk in terms of the occurrence of 
 wmsd ; there were no significant differences between the kinetic records for the two 
 instrumentation techniques ; a higher level of muscular activity was verified in the majority of the muscles assessed 
 ( extensor carpi radialis , flexor carpi radialis , brachioradialis and triceps brachii ) , 
 although the motor strategy was shown to be distinct for each of the two techniques 
 tested .
some authors have suggested that , in 
 addition to these factors , root canal preparation with nickel - titanium ( niti ) 
 instruments is associated with the least stress and operating fatigue , especially due to 
 the decrease in working time when compared with manual instrumentation with stainless 
 steel . the development of endodontic instruments made from niti alloy has the potential 
 to enhance the shaping of narrow , curved canals , a procedure which has proved difficult 
 to achieve using stainless steels instruments because of their inherent 
 stiffness .
