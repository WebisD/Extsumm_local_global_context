the goals of the current study are thus threefold : ( 1 ) to provide an overview of medicare 's current coverage and payment policies regarding hospitalization for psychiatric disorders ; ( 2 ) to present descriptive statistics that update some of the data provided in earlier reports on psychiatric hospitalizations of medicare beneficiaries ( freiman , goldman , and taube , 1990 ; lave and goldman , 1990 ) ; and ( 3 ) to provide new information on demographic , diagnostic , utilization , and expenditure characteristics associated with 1995 inpatient psychiatric care among medicare beneficiaries . enhancing our understanding of the types of persons being treated and their service utilization and expenditure patterns may enable decisionmakers to monitor ( and perhaps modify ) medicare policies and programs to assure the most efficient and effective care delivery to beneficiaries in need of psychiatric services .
the data presented in this article provide an overview of demographic , diagnostic , utilization , and expenditure characteristics associated with the delivery of medicare part a services to beneficiaries with mental and addictive disorders in 1995 .
part of the explanation for this change may be related to the growth of disabled medicare beneficiaries , who accounted for more than two - thirds ( 70.7 percent ) of all medicare discharges for psychiatric and addictive disorders from psychiatric hospitals .
