the creation of simulated cohorts could help explain a more complete picture of patient outcomes and allow researchers to explore all aspects of a patient experience 
the ability to compare the relative effectiveness of different technologies and treatment modalities is now imperative in order to meet the growing demand for more rigorous outcomes research . today
while each of these datasets provides unique information , they lack a significant amount of information about the patients themselves and their associated treatments . given these challenges and data limitations , there is a need for new , advanced techniques to overcome the limitations of existing data sources , thereby enhancing their utility for cer .
the probabilistic linkage method for simulated cohorts demonstrated that patients from different us - based health plan administrative claims databases matched on similar pre - index characteristics may demonstrate similar outcomes in the post - index period .
in the absence of the ideal data source , there is an alternative : a method whereby researchers can maximize the benefits of each individual type of data source , utilizing data linkage methods to fill in the gaps of one database with the strengths of another .
electronic medical record ( emr ) systems , newly launched to replace paper - based chart systems in tracking clinical symptoms and disease , are still in the early stages of development .
