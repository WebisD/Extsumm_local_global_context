the objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of continuous ropivacaine and morphine injection using intrathecal access ports in patients suffering from cancer pain refractory to traditional treatment modalities .
intrathecal morphine and ropivacaine management in connection with a transplantable subcutaneous port is a safe and efficient approach to provide treatment of intractable cancer pain .
the preoperative oral morphine consumption was between 45 and 600  mg / day ( mean : 200.8  mg / day ) in group m. the preoperative oral analgesic consumption was between 6 and 750  mg / day ( mean : 223.7  mg / day ) in group r. the mean preoperative doses of oral morphine in groups m and r were similar ( p = 0.688 ) .
the average nrs scores for the 19 patients in group m on the preoperative day and postoperative days 1 , 3 , 7 , and 15 were 8.17  0.51 , 4.78  1.0 , 3.78  0.80 , 3.06  0.94 , and 2.50  1.04 , respectively . the average nrs scores for the 17 patients in group r on the preoperative day and postoperative days 1 , 3 , 7 , and 15 were 7.78  0.73 , 3.67  1.37 , 2.56  1.34 , 2.06  1.16 , and 1.33  0.77 , respectively .
