the experimental results validated that the rmse value of the proposed iifdl was improved by 38.27% of cnn and 21.69% of hekf for the intra - fractional variation .
the proposed iifdl clusters the respiratory movements based on breathing similarities and estimates patients breathing motion using the proposed fuzzy deep learning ( fdl ) . to reduce the computation time ,
the iifdl also improved the prediction overshoot by 66.90% for cnn and 74.96% for hekf for the intra - fractional variation . in a case of the inter - fractional variation ,
first , this is the first analytical study for modeling multiple patients breathing data based on both intra- and inter - fractional variations .
thirdly , the novel method should be able to handle any unpredictable breathing variation.table 2previous prediction methods for intra- and inter - fractional variations.methoddescriptiondrawbackvariationmargin-based  compensated locational changes of the tumor in a primitive way , adding extra margins high possibility of over / under - dose since the margin is determined by motion range of the tumor without knowing its variationintra-/inter - fractionlinear predictive model ( lp ) ,  estimated the future state based on functions comprised of linear combination of input data , proper coefficients , and constants inferior prediction accuracy for breathing signals with a long latency poor performance improvement by its exclusive usage assumption that the nonlinear respiratory movement is linearintra-/inter - fractionadaptive filter ( af ) , , ,  ,  combined modified lps and additional filters that adjust coefficients of lps no guarantee of its superb performance in most cases because it highly depends on adaptation intervalsintra - fractionkalman filter ( kf ) , , ,  efficient recurrent filter which has been utilized in various forms : kalman constant velocity , kalman constant acceleration , an interacting multiple model , and hybrid implementation based on the extended kf ( hekf) only adaptable to linear or nearly linear estimation high computation complexity of kf - based models combined with other prediction toolsintra - fractionartificial neural network ( nn)-based , , , , , , , ,  , ,  showed outstanding accuracy for irregular patterns and abrupt changes, extended approaches : back propagation nn , feed - forward nn , recursive nn , wavelet nn , customized prediction with multiple patient interactions using nn ( cnn ) , and hekf long calculation time for prediction parameters and resultsintra - fractioncubic model  estimated respiratory variance by using a third - order polynomial equation same drawback of low accuracy as lp because the cubic model is also one of the mathematic approaches like lpinter - fractionstochastic fluence map optimization ( fmo ) model  extended deterministic fmo model , which assumes that a patient is static solved observed problems by employing convex penalty functions and numerous scenarios to characterize inter - fractional uncertainties unpredictable method for other disregarded scenariosinter - fraction in this paper , we propose a new prediction approach for intra- and inter - fraction variations , called intra- and inter - fractional variation prediction using fuzzy deep learning ( iifdl ) .
