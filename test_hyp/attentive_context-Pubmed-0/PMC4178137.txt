therefore , the goals of the present study were to clarify the localization of prrsv in infected swine and to evaluate the use of oral fluid specimens for prrsv detection in the field .
in order to determine the localization of prrsv , sera and tissue samples from two sows that had naturally aborted and seven grower pigs were examined . in sows , viral nucleic acids were detected in the absence of gross and microscopic lesions with the exception of mild tonsillitis .
similar to previous studies , abortion associated with prrsv infection was not associated with the appearance of lesions .
thus , the gilts may have been infected before the vaccine - induced immune response to the virus was initiated . moreover , nucleotide sequencing data indicated that the gilts were infected by the field strain , which shared only a 87% to 89% nucleotide identity with the vaccine strain .
therefore , the current vaccine that contains a single strain of prrsv might not be effective for protecting the animals against infection with genetically different strains of prrsv .
indirect transmission might be a useful method for exposing replacement gilts to the current prrsv circulating in the farm and inducing an immune response before entering the prrsv - positive breeding herd .
