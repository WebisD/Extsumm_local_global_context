we also showed that the c varies considerably in males and females , in young and old people .
known populations , source of data , back estimation of their population sizes , and the e / r ratio e / r ratio in separate estimations of social network size for men and women ( before and after excluding the three out of range e / r ratio known groups ) figure 1 represents the scatter plot of the real against estimated sizes of the thirteen known populations , and the same measures after excluding the three abovementioned subpopulations .
therefore , local estimations for c in different sub - populations are needed to improve the accuracy of nsu estimations .
the following methods were employed to investigate the sources for these potential errors : 1 ) back estimation of each of the known populations to determine the best groups for estimating the ultimate social network size , and 2 ) variable stratification of the study samples , carrying out all analyses independently in each subgroup , and comparing results with that for the total sample .
the present study was designed to examine the social network size of the tehran province residents and the demographic factors affecting it in order to prepare the grounds for estimating the size of hidden populations .
