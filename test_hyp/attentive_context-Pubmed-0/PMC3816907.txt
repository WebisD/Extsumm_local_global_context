if so , then this may provide a new target for the development of disease - modifying drugs that restore -cell mass and function in type 2 and secondary diabetes through redifferentiation .
consistent with a role for dedifferentiation in the pathogenesis of -cell dysfunction in diabetes , we describe previously unreported coexpression of mesenchymal and -cell phenotypic markers in insulin - positive cells in two patients with recently diagnosed noninsulin - requiring diabetes and in one patient with previously undiagnosed diabetes .
patient 2 was an 81-year - old woman who underwent distal pancreatectomy for an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm .
our data provide circumstantial evidence for the recently reported phenomenon of -cell dedifferentiation and possible reprogramming to -cells in humans . whether this process is reversible in vivo , contributing to the rapid recovery of -cell function after calorie restriction or bariatric surgery , requires further study .
it recently has been postulated from a series of -cell fate - marking studies of transgenic mice that dedifferentiation is the primary mechanism underlying -cell failure in nonautoimmune diabetes ( 5 ) . specifically , the investigators proposed that metabolic stress leads to activation of mesenchymal markers in endocrine cells , a phenomenon well described in human -cells after establishment in adherent proliferative culture but not previously described in vivo in preclinical studies or in situ in humans ( 7,8 ) .
