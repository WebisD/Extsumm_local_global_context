the data will also be useful in monitoring resistance trends in a region over time and assessing the effects of interventions to reduce antimicrobial resistance .
for example , a laboratory reported 4% vancomycin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae , but the laboratory staff was not able to explain this finding or recognize the clinical implications . also 2 of the hospitals reported 2 vancomycin - intermediate staphylococcus aureus in their antibiogram . however , the isolates were not available for verification , and the laboratory staff was not aware of the implications of this finding .
a packet was sent to the clinical microbiology laboratories of the 77 hospitals in the area .
in spite of expertise and resources available in the united states , the use of antimicrobial drugs in day - to - day practice is suboptimal and directly responsible for multidrug resistance in a number of common pathogens .
the factor that converts antimicrobial therapy from " empiric " to " rational " is in vitro susceptibility testing and reporting .
this study has helped us identify serious shortcomings in susceptibility testing methods and reporting , and we hope to address these issues through a regional advisory group .
