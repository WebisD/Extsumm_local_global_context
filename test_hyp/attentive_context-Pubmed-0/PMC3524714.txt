the aim of this study was to investigate possible factors associated with pain intensity among turkish school children with nlbp , aged 1018 years , and to determine the relationship between related factors and pain intensity using the regression tree method .
therefore , health care providers should evaluate school children carefully and make accurate observations in terms of risk factors , including duration of studying , type of bed , transportation to / from school , and obesity , to predict any severe musculoskeletal problems , especially nlbp . finally , physical factors and musculoskeletal risk factors are especially important in terms of nlbp in school children .
the overall mean and standard deviation of pain intensity was 2.580.86 ( minimum=1 , maximum=5 ) . among the risk factors used in this study , duration of studying , type of bed , transportation to / from school , and bmi score were found to have a significant effect on pain intensity , while sex , studying posture , regular exercise habit , and bag handling were not significant ( figure 1 ) . as will be seen from figure 1 ,
the prevalence has been reported to vary from 10% to 40% in the literature , but the authors found it to be 46.7% in their previous cross - sectional study of 624 school children / adolescents 1018 years old . among the 8 risk factors included in the study ,
