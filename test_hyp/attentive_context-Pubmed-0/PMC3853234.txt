a case of a 30-year - old male patient with primary thoracic epidural lymphoma who presented with back pain is presented in this paper .
most patients with hodgkin 's disease and spinal epidural involvement either present with concurrent neurological and nodal disease or develop neurological disease after being diagnosed with hodgkin 's disease .
the present case demonstrated that physicians should include primary spinal epidural hodgkin 's lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of spinal tumors .
treatment of hodgkin 's lymphoma will almost always include in the acute phase a form of emergency decompressive surgery , with or without resection , followed by chemotheraphy and/or radiotheraphy .
a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scan of the thoracic spine demonstrated an epidural tumor at the t911 level ( figs  13 ) .
our case is apparently the seventh case to be diagnosed with hodgkin 's disease who presented with spinal cord compression due to epidural space without lymphoma elsewhere .
the severity of pain was associated with the inability to perform the activities of daily living .
the results of all other examinations ( f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( f-18 fdg pet / ct ) , bone marrow biopsy and computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest , abdomen and pelvis ) were negative for an occult disease .
