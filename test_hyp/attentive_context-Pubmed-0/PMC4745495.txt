the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution imposed to this study in pulp ph were noticed to be nonsignificant at different days after storage .
the results showed a mild growing up trend of nonreducing sugar from different treatment combinations at various days .
different doses of bdf solution imposed to this investigation in terms of titratable acidity showed significant variation among the means at various days of storage .
the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution exhibited nonsignificant in terms of nonreducing sugar content of mango pulp at different days after storage .
a slightly rising trend of pulp ph from various treatment combinations at different days of storage appeared . at different days of storage
it also explored that tss content was hastily grown up from untreated mangoes from initial to 6th day , and then it came down significantly .
the highest ( 6.90 ) ph value was reported from the treatment combination of v2b0 which was statistically at par with v1b0 and the lowest ( 6.70 ) was reported from the treatment of combination of v1b3 , respectively .
the two mango varieties , namely , langra and khirshapath , were selected as experimental materials . the mango varieties undertaken for investigation were collected from mango grower of kansart , shibganj upazila of chapainowabgonj district and charghat upazila of rajshahi district , and other material used as postharvest treatments , namely , bavistin df ( bdf ) , were collected from royal scientific store at cooperative market , rajshahi city market . the experiment consisted of two factors and
