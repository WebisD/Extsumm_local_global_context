despite all the research demonstrating its safety , adverse cardiac arrhythmias such as nodal rhythm with bradycardia , prolongation of qtc interval , precipitation of torsade de pointes and isorhythmic atrioventricular dissociation ( isravd ) have been reported with sevoflurane anaesthesia .
a 60-year - old woman weighing 60 kg with carcinoma in the right breast was scheduled for elective modified radical mastectomy .
caution should also be exercised with its use in patients on ca channel and b blocker therapy .
sevoflurane does not sensitise the myocardium to arrhythmogenic effects of catecholamines and has the least effect on cardiac conduction system .
high incidence of nodal rhythm ( 20% ) and bradycardia with use of sevoflurane has been reported in unpremedicated infants .
a discrepancy was observed between the hr and the pr due to intermittent electrical alternans in the ecg .
to conclude , sevoflurane in high concentration ( 8% ) should be used with caution in children and in conditions where primary pacemaker activity is suppressed , as in elderly .
reported a case of intraoperative torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during sevoflurane anaesthesia , which persisted with dc shock but reverted to sinus rhythm after 10 minutes of discontinuation of sevoflurane and after the patient was awakened .
