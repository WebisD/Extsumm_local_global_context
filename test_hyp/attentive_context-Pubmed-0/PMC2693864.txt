we report here on a case of pancreatic panniculitis associated with acute pancreatitis that had a fatal outcome .
the association of pancreatic disease with fat necrosis at distant foci was first described by chiari in 1883 ( 1 ) .
pancreatic panniculitis is a pathognomic finding of pancreatic disease , and as in our case , the cutaneous lesions may precede the usual manifestations of underlying pancreatic disease by several weeks to months ( 11 ) .
physicians should be aware of this disease entity because this rare cutaneous manifestation may be associated with major morbidity and significant mortality .
other pancreatic disorders have been infrequently reported to be associated with pancreatic panniculitis , and these include post - traumatic pancreatitis , pancreatic pseudocyst , pancreas divisum , and hemophagocytic syndrome ( 2 ) . to the best of our knowledge ,
one case was associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma , and the other two were associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis , respectively ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) .
the most common pancreatic disorders associated with pancreatic panniculitis are acute or chronic pancreatitis , especially the alcohol - related types , and pancreatic carcinoma .
the removal of gallstones has resulted in complete resolution ( 8) . however , disseminated fat necrosis is associated with major morbidity and mortality . in a review of 27 patients with pancreatic panniculitis , all 8 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and 42% of the 19 patients with pancreatitis died of their disease , as was seen in our case ( 9 ) .
