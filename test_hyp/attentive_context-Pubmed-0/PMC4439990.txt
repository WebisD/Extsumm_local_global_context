the results of this study suggest that aloe may be successfully associated with chemotherapy to increase the tumor regression rate and survival time .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate in balb / c mice the in vivo influence of commercial aloe vera gel product ( aloe vera drinking gel ) on the syngeneic l-1 sarcoma tumor growth and its vascularization : a ) early cutaneous neovascular response , tumor - induced angiogenesis ( tia test ) , and b ) tumor hemoglobin content measured 14 days after l-1 sarcoma cell grafting .
no difference was observed in hemoglobin content between control and experimental tumors ( 21.3 3.1 vs. 24.1 3.6 g / mg , respectively ) . the effect of feeding mice with aloe vera drinking gel for 14 days after l-1 sarcoma subcutaneous grafting on the tumor volume ( difference on the border of statistical significance )
aloe arborescens was given orally at a dose of 10 ml thrice daily of a mixture consisting of 300 g of aloe fresh leaves in 500 g of honey plus 40 ml of 40% alcohol , every day without interruption , either during or after chemotherapy , until the progression of disease , starting 6 days prior to the onset of chemotherapy .
