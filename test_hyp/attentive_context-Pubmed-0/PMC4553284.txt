the effusion within the blht sheath was detected in 58.42% of all patients and the average amount was 1.7  1.6 mm in all patients of the present study . among them , patients with adhesive capsulitis showed effusion within the blht sheath most frequently , and the average amount of that group was larger than that of the other shoulder diseases . because the effusion within the blht sheath looks like a fried egg ,
in particular , the forward flexion and internal rotation levels were most closely correlated with the amount of effusion within the blht sheath in each group .
the amount of effusion within the blht sheath showed a negative correlation with the range of motion and functional scores in each group .
zubler et al.12 ) reported that in their ultrasonographic study , the width of the anechoic fluid collection in the blht sheath was increased after 8 to 12 ml of fluid was injected into the glenohumeral joint in most cases .
the amount of the effusion within the blht sheath overall had a negative correlation with the range of motion in all patients : forward flexion ( pcc = -0.491 ; p < 0.05 ) , external rotation in 90 abduction ( pcc = -0.381 ; p < 0.05 ) , external rotation at the side ( pcc = -0.356 ; p < 0.05 ) , and internal rotation ( pcc = -0.486 ; p < 0.05 ) . in patients with adhesive capsulitis ,
