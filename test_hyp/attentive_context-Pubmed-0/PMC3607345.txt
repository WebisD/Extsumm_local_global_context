the four - field - box ( 4fb ) technique for cervical carcinoma is often utilized to improve dose homogeneity .
a lady on evaluation and referral from her gynecologist , presented to us with the diagnosis of stage - ib2 cervical - carcinoma staged as per the figo ( federation of international gynaecologists and obstetricians ) system . as we were preparing to initiate this patient on a course of concurrent chemo - rt , we had the opportunity to review her magnetic - resonance imaging ( mri ) films obtained earlier by her gynecologist .
we intend to demonstrate the potential benefits with the use of sectional imaging in safely delineating target - volumes .
the success of radiotherapy ( rt ) depends not upon the expense and complexity involved , but upon the correctness of techniques .
traditional bony - landmarks may have been used as a surrogate , but they do not always correlate with the actual location of the soft - tissue target - volumes .
the exact placement of the posterior border on the lateral portals of this technique is unfortunately not supported by stone - hard consensus ; placing it at the s2-s3 junction may increase the chance of sparing rectum but at the risk of target - miss .
