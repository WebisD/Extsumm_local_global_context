sepsis has been classically considered the archetypal clinical condition with molecular links between inflammation and coagulation .
the clinical relevance of rhapc treatment via increased apc / epcr - mps requires further exploration , especially in larger numbers of patients with septic shock and higher mortality . in conclusion
mp - associated apc is stable in measurable levels , and activities would point to physiological and clinical relevance as bioactive effectors in rhapc - treated patients and contribute to the effectiveness of rhapc in severe sepsis
a fragile balance between the harmful and helpful effects of mps especially during severe sepsis should be underlined .
rhapc treatment for severe sepsis can induce the generation and release of mps in vivo , with a clinical correlative trend towards improved outcome . circulating mps from patients during rhapc treatment express apc , epcr and cd13 .
mps could potentially be developed as new therapeutic tools to transfer biological vectors of cellular communication and are able to modulate important cellular regulatory functions at a distal site of its production in response to pharmacological agents such as rhapc .
both inflammation and thrombosis can be orchestrated by the interactions between circulating cells , such as lymphocytes , platelets , and vascular cells , which under activation or apoptosis lead to the release of circulating microparticles ( mps ) . in the previous issue of critical care ,
