the objective of this study protocol was to set up a standard pyrogen testing facility and to establish documented evidence if the process employed for bet testing of f18-fdg by gel clot method produces the desired results consistently , when performed as per the standard operating procedures .
much of the current success in clinical positron emission tomography ( pet ) can be attributed to the development of 2-(f ) fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose ( f18-fdg ) .
table 1 summarizes the results of the undiluted f18-fdg on the positive control solutions at an endotoxin concentration of 0.5 eu / ml ( 4 ) . of the 10 undiluted f18-fdg batches ,
the dilution of the test sample is the easiest means to resolve the potential product inhibition / enhancement problem during the gel clot testing procedure .
random samples of the f18-fdg from september 2010 to march 2011 were subjected to the gel clot bet .
similar results were found in the present study with the undiluted samples as two vials of the ppc ( endotoxin concentration equal to 0.5 eu / ml ) did not gel , indicating the interference with the gel formation . the interference may be due to the presence of the citrate ions . at the expiration time , the maximum administered total dose in milliliters of fdg should contain less than 175 eu .
