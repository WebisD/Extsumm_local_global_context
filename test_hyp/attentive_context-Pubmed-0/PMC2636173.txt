it is imperative to seek 
 past and recent history of trauma and maintain a high index of 
 suspicion in all such cases , regardless of the interval between 
 the trauma and current presentation .
so the general recommendation is to leave them 
 alone in the absence of specific indications for removal.4 
 however , organic foreign bodies like wood have a much 
 higher incidence of potentially sight - threatening and life- 
 threatening complications.5 they may remain dormant for 
 a variable period of time and manifest with delayed - onset 
 orbital granuloma , cellulitis , abscess or chronic draining sinus.1 
 hence , surgical removal of organic intraorbital foreign bodies 
 is recommended.5 in our case , a piece of the foreign body had been removed 
 after the initial trauma .
it is important for the ophthalmologist , radiologist and 
 pathologist to include foreign body granuloma among the 
 differentials of an intraorbital mass .
a 19-year - old male presented to the casualty with a history of 
 injury to his left eye by a palm leaf , which fell from a height of 
 about 10 meters
when seen in our casualty on the 
 evening of the same day , the wound looked superficial and there 
 was no clinical evidence of a residual foreign body .
