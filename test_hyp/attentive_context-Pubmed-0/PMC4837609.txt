we report a case of ameloblastoma with metastatic spread to the brain and the neck after repeated local recurrences .
this report describes a patient who presented a long history of local recurrence and distant metastasis of ameloblastoma .
molecular analysis was performed with the aim to better characterize this neoplasm and its peculiar behaviour .
this occurrence is estimated in approximately 2% of the cases , and the most common site for metastasis is the lung ( 75 - 80% ) , followed by the cervical lymph nodes , the diaphragm , the liver and the brain . on the other hand , ameloblastic carcinoma shows combined histologic features of ameloblastoma with cytologic atypia , regardless of the presence of metastasis .
further studies are needed to identify molecular pathways that may provide an opportunity of alternative treatments and/or new potential predictive markers of local and distant spread of this rare tumour .
ameloblastoma is a rare tumour of odontogenic epithelial origin , which accounts for approximately 1% of all mandibular tumours and cysts [ 1 - 2 ] .
a 29-year - old male presented a swelling of the oral cavity without any symptoms .
thus , it is difficult to predict the behaviour of this neoplasm , which has always an uncertain malignant potential . generally accepted risk factors for the development of metastasis include large primary lesion , late diagnosis of the initial tumour , multiple local recurrences , inadequate surgical treatment , radio - chemotherapy treatment and plexiform pattern , even if the exact nature and the role played by each factor is not clear . in addition
