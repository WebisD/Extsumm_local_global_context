this report is unique due to the fact that fetal echocardiographic features consistent with the diagnosis of endocardial fibrosis following maternal organophosphorus poisoning are not an indication for termination of pregnancy , which is contradictory to the common practice .
though fetal endocardial fibroelastosis ( efe ) has been reported in the past three decades , the classical echocardiographic features of efe following maternal organophosphorus ingestion at 20 weeks of gestation is reported for the first time in the literature .
a 23-year - old primigravida at 20 weeks of gestation was hospitalized , following suicidal attempt by ingestion of organophosphorus pesticide ( carbofuran ) .
these signs completely regressed within a period or 14 weeks and a normal healthy full - term baby was delivered .
the use of intensive maternal corticosteroid administration must have contributed to the complete regression of efe .
the case illustrated here shows that efe may result from myocardial toxicity induced by organophosphorus poisoning , which may completely regress without further complications and is not a definite indication for the termination of pregnancy .
she was treated with antidote , corticosteroid steroid , and supportive measures . following recovery after 2 weeks
the fetus in this case was exposed to acute maternal carbofuran poisoning at 20 weeks of gestation . since fetal period
