targeted therapies that block egfr , met , and igf-1r signaling in head and neck cancers continue to show promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials .
however , it is difficult to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapeutics and potential side effects during long - term in vivo use . given the interplay between these rtk signaling pathways and the mediocre results obtained with monotherapy regimens thus far , clinical trials will be required to determine how egfr- , met- , and igf-1r - targeted therapies can be used in combination in order to definitively abrogate their common downstream oncogenic signaling networks .
this short review will explore the relative contribution of each signaling axis to disease progression , potential modes of cross - talk , and targeted clinical approaches under investigation for disease management .
these findings suggest a strong etiologic role for rtk dysregulation in this type of tumors . given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) .     
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( hnscc ) is a heterogeneous disease that includes tumors arising from the mucosal epithelial surface of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . although these tumors originate within different anatomic sites within the upper aerodigestive tract , they are histologically identical ( 95% of hnscc are squamous cell carcinomas ) , share common etiologic risk factors and overlapping metastatic target site profiles ( reviewed in   ) .
