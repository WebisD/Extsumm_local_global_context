the aim of this review is to summarize recent research findings that examine the potential for physical activity , cardiorespiratory fitness , and exercise interventions to enhance brain health in late life .
in contrast , a good deal of research has been conducted to examine the effects of physical activity and cognitive stimulation on human brain morphology and function .
, we argue that the influence of physical activity on brain plasticity might have consequences not only for memory and other cognitive functions , but also has implications for many different psychiatric and neurologic conditions through a set of common biological pathways .
a recent report estimated that modifiable risk factors including education , smoking , mid - life obesity , hypertension , diabetes , depression , and physical inactivity contribute significantly to the risk of alzheimer 's disease , and that a 10% to 25% reduction in these factors could prevent as many as 3 million cases worldwide . yet , despite the recognition of the importance of modifiable risk factors in the incidence and prevalence of cognitive impairment , there is often a misunderstanding of the research that has been conducted examining whether intervening on these modifiable risk factors would have any noticeable effect on brain or cognitive health .
