study subjects were recruited as follows : thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1),thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ) .
the prevalence of cti was higher in hiv seropositive women as compared to hiv seronegative women ( or 4.214 ; 95% ci 0.45738.865 ) and among the hiv positive asymptomatic as compared to the hiv negative asymptomatic ( or 2.111 ; 95% ci 1.6062.776 ) , although the differences were not found to be statistically significant ( table 6 ) .
this was a cross - sectional analysis to determine the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection by using real - time pcr in hiv seropositive and seronegative , symptomatic , and asymptomatic women visiting the ictc of our department .
our study also stresses the usefulness of screening asymptomatic hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected females for cti by risk assessment and diagnostic testing periodically to prevent the occurrence of adverse outcomes associated with the disease and also to check further spread of infection in the community . for countries like india that still do not currently have an active chlamydia screening program in place ,
