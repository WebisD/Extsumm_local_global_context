recommendations for a widespread use of statins were introduced in many countries at the start of this period , leading to improvements even in the absence of pay - for - performance .
the greater improvement of low - performing practices may , in part , be accounted for by a ceiling effect , which restricted the potential improvement in high - performing practices .
there has been a substantial increase in the proportion of all diabetic subjects achieving intermediate outcome targets . in our previous report ( 7 ) , we analyzed clinical data from individual patient records for 26 practices during the period of 20002003 that gave results consistent with administrative data from the qof .
we caution that it is not clear that proposed benefits from pay - for - performance would be observed if this model is adopted in systems with different organizational arrangements and models of practitioner remuneration .
the total number of diabetic subjects in england achieving the a1c target , after allowing for exclusions from assessment , increased by 341,173 between 20042005 and 20072008 , representing 16% of diabetic subjects registered in 20072008 . over the same period ,
in the u.k . , the care of subjects with type 2 diabetes is increasingly undertaken outside of specialist clinics by family physicians and practice nurses in primary care . this has led to concerns that some patients may experience poor - quality care ( 6 ) . the new national contract for family practices introduced in 2004 appears to have achieved favorable results in its initial year ( 4,7 ) and may have contributed to reducing socioeconomic inequalities in care ( 8,9 ) .
