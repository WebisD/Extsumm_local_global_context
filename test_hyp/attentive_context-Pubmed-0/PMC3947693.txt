patient selection is very crucial and should be carried out by a multidisciplinary group of specialists ( anaesthetists , surgeons , clinicians , and oncologists ) in order to achieve better results and to reduce the high costs related to these procedures and relevant complications .
gastric cancer ( gc ) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the world   . the principal risk factors in development of gc are helicobacter pylori infection , atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia , male gender , cigarette smoking , partial gastrectomy , menetrier 's disease , and genetic factors .
an interdisciplinary approach should be developed further : the association of nips , crs , hipec , and epic could increase the rate of cc-0 procedures and consequently survival rates , particularly for pci 6   .
metastatic dissemination in gc may occur through the hematic torrent or by dissemination to the peritoneal cavity ; this last condition is called peritoneal carcinomatosis ( pc ) , and it is considered a stage iv of gc .
neoadjuvant chemotherapy , routinely recommended for management of gc without pc , may improve survival also in pc from gc   and adjuvant chemotherapy could prevent recurrence from gc .
