the instrument described here can be used to remove all types of polyaxial and monoaxial screws used in spine surgery .
a large increase in fusion rates for spine surgery has been observed in the last 20 years9 ) , and the frequency of revision spine surgery continues to increase .
after removing the cap screws and rods , all of the polyaxial screws were made monoaxial with the instrument described above and were removed rapidly in a minimally invasive way with no complications .
a total of 42 polyaxial screws were removed from five patients with the new single - piece screw remover ( fig .
the aim of our polyaxial screw remover design is to facilitate screw removal and thereby reduce blood loss , infection risk , cost , and effort expended by the surgeon .
debridement is important to remove scars , envision the bone elements , and prepare a new fusion bed during revision surgery .
this is not always possible and in some circumstances the implant may no longer be in production . when revision surgery studies were examined5,12 ) ,
we have described a screw removal instrument designed to overcome the problems of screw removal often encountered during revision surgery .
