examination of age- and size - selective harvest of sockeye salmon in a commercial gillnet fishery over 57 years revealed higher susceptibility and exploitation of older and larger fish in most years .
sockeye salmon runs with varying sex ratios and proportions of age classes experienced different selection patterns due to sex- and age - specific difference in fishery selectivity . the gillnet vulnerability curve and the selectivity of the fishery
our study fills a need for quantifying the intensity of harvest selection and estimating selection differentials directly ( law 2007 ; kuparinen et al .
this overall result confirmed the general belief that  larger is more vulnerable, but the details of our findings revealed a much more intricate and variable pattern of exploitation and vulnerability ( fig .
we did not seek to determine explicitly whether fishery selection in this system is leading to changes in age and size at maturity , as that topic can only be fully addressed after the selection itself has been quantified ( hutchings and fraser 2008 ) , and the effects of selection are integrated with the environmental factors that also affect growth and maturation .
however , we present data to help assess the possible evolutionary and ecological consequences of the size - specific fishing pressure at a basic level .
