we report a case of primary nhl of the parotid gland in a 61-year - old male that was diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) with further histological confirmation .
primary lymphoma of the parotid gland is an uncommon entity . predominantly ( 84 - 97% ) parotid lymphomas are
non - hodgkin lymphomas ( nhl ) and most of them are of b - cell origin . there may be coexisting lymphadenopathy of the cervical region . however , to categorize them as a primary from the parotid , the first clinical manifestation should arise in the parotid gland .
a 61-year - old male presented with a painless swelling in the right parotid region for the last 1 year and right sided cervical swelling for the last 3 months . on examination , a mass of 5 cm  5 cm was identified in the parotid region .
malignant lymphoma of the parotid gland is relatively rare and constitutes about 4 - 5% of extranodal lymphomas , and 1 - 4% of all parotid tumors .
lymphoma of the salivary gland is highly chemo - radiosensitive and , therefore , a timely diagnosis is important .
