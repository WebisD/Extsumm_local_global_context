given the health risks associated with obesity ( heart disease , diabetes , hypertension , cancer ) , this has important implications for global health , and in light of the additional health - care costs associated with obesity , the global economy .
perinatal nutrition has enduring effects on many aspects of physiology and behavior including the regulation of energy balance , susceptibility to metabolic disorders , programming of body weight set point , stress response   and mental health - related behaviors .
in addition to perinatal nutrition , a number of factors associated with maternal consumption of a high - fat diet ( hfd ) , including maternal adiposity , hyperlipidemia , lipotoxicity , glucose levels and insulin resistance , also have a long - term impact on the developing offspring and are associated with increased risk of obesity , metabolic disorders , and mental health disorders . as maternal obesity
accumulating evidence from epidemiologic studies and animal models indicate that maternal health and nutritional state during pregnancy and lactation play a critical role in programming the neural circuitry that regulates energy balance and behavior in offspring , having a sustained influence on their physiology and behavior .
