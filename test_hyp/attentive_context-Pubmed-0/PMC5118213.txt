the aim of this study was to classify the maturation degree based on the morphology of the midpalatal suture by using cbct images and to investigate relationships with conventional developmental age indices ( indices of maturation ) .
in this study , we evaluated maturation stage based on the morphology of the midpalatal suture on cbct images , and investigated correlations and associations between the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture and developmental age indices . among developmental age indices ,
the hwm and cvm showed strong correlations and high associations with the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture on cbct images , meaning that these methods can be used to speculate on the maturation of the midpalatal suture according to its morphology .
the association between hellman 's index and chronological age also reached a significant level , but the contingency coefficient values were lower than those for the hwm and cvm (  = 0.809 and 0.741 ; and kendall 's -b = 0.673 and 0.635 , respectively ) .
this result was similar to the findings of other studies showing strong correlations between facial skeletal growth and skeletal age.1920 a difference is that previous studies evaluated facial size by linear growth of the mandible , but the current study evaluated maturation of the midpalatal suture . because of statistical weakness , it was impossible to compare relative usability among each index with values from the correlation analysis . thus , a crosstab analysis using a contingency coefficient was performed additionally ( table 8).21 when the crosstab analysis was performed with cbct stages , the hwm (  = 0.924 , kendall 's -b = 0.807 ) and cvm (  = 0.905 , kendall 's -b = 0.784 ) showed higher values than chronological age (  = 0.741 , kendall 's -b = 0.635 ) and hellman 's dental age (  = 0.809 , kendall 's -b = 0.673 ) .
