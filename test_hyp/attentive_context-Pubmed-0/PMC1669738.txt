we adopt bacello to annotate whole genomes in association with methods specifically implemented for the prediction of the topology of integral membrane proteins . in this paper
we present eukaryotic subcellular localization database ( esldb ) , a database of protein subcellular localization which provides an annotation for the entire proteomes of eukaryotic organisms . for each sequence
our database contains the experimental localization , when available , the homology - based annotation , when feasible , and the predicted localization computed with the in - house developed machine learning based methods . by this the new database provides more features than other existing databases . to date , five proteomes were fully processed : homo sapiens , mus musculus , caenorhabditis elegans , saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana . in summary , esldb is , to our knowledge , the first database containing the available experimental and similarity - based annotations for eukaryotic proteomes listing for each protein sequence also the predicted subcellular localization .
we recently developed bacello , a well - performing balanced method for the prediction of subcellular localization , outperforming previously existing methods for the same task ( 8) .
pa - gosub ( 17 ) contains the annotations of eukaryotic subcellular localization and protein function of different genomes and is based on homology search and bayesian artificial networks for prediction .
