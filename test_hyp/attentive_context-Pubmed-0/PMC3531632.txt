this review addresses the definition of high - risk , localized prostate cancer ; treatment options ; surgical and comparative outcomes ; the role of pelvic lymphadenectomy ( plnd ) ; and the benefit of radical prostatectomy ( rp ) in the setting of lymph node metastasis .
clinical definitions of high - risk prostate cancer vary , and a definite biological marker of lethal prostate cancer phenotypes is not yet available . nevertheless , studying the commonly used d'amico - nccn high - risk definition , physicians have identified patient and preoperative tumor factors that can guide treatment decisions ( surgery versus combined modality radiotherapy with androgen deprivation ) to optimize oncologic outcomes .
must focus on correctly identifying men with lethal , high - risk profiles of disease , and once diagnosed , treating these men effectively .
thus , the paramount challenges to reduce the burden of prostate cancer deaths are 1 ) to correctly identify men with lethal disease while it is still curable and 2 ) to effectively treat this high - risk group to optimize oncologic and survival outcomes .
due to high worldwide prevalence , prostate cancer deaths comprise a significant health burden despite relatively low overall mortality rates . strategies to reduce prostate cancer deaths , therefore ,
