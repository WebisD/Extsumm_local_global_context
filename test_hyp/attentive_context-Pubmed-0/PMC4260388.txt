om and other odontogenic tumors share common features on conventional radiographs that lead to a diagnostic dilemma . in order to establish a treatment protocol ,
odontogenic myxoma ( om ) is considered to be a relatively rare benign tumor of mesenchymal origin .
a 17-year - old male patient visited us with a complaint of swelling in the left maxillary molar region , which enlarged to the present size within a span of 3 months .
the treatment options can include curettage with peripheral ostectomy , segmental resection and radical resections for the more aggressive lesions .
om exhibits aggressive infiltration of the adjacent tissue as it is not encapsulated and complete surgical removal is difficult .
the histogenesis of om is related to the odontogenic ectomesenchyme of a developing tooth or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the periodontal ligament .
it has a high tendency to recur and can transform into malignant lesion ; hence , radiographic and histopathological interpretation are important to establish appropriate surgical management .
myxomas of the jaw bones have been traditionally considered to have an odontogenic origin due to the close relation to teeth . according to the literature
it is found in the skin and subcutaneous tissue , heart and also in various sites of the head and neck region .
