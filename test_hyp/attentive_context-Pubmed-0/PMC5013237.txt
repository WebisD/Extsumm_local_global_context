several molecular targets for diagnostic pcr testing have been evaluated in leishmania , including minicircle kinetoplast dna ( kdna ) ( 5 , 6 ) , the mini - exon ( spliced leader rna ) gene ( 7 ) , gp63 polymerase chain reaction analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp ) ( 8) , and the internal transcribed spacer ( its ) ( 1 , 3 , 9 , 10 ) .
thus , the results of the present study confirm that in the border area of sistan va baluchestan , on the peninsula of chabahar , l. major is the causative agent of cl , with genotypic variation in this area .
rflp was performed on the its1 region in the ribosomal operons of 24 isolates of l. major . after using the restriction enzyme haeiii , banding patterns , including fragments of 140 bp and 210 bp bands ,
we used the pcr - rflp assay of its1 genes for the direct identification of leishmania species in 24 out of 33 patients suspected to have cl .
digestion with this enzyme showed 300 bp and 150 bp banding patterns , dissimilar to the l. major reference strain . in two cases ,
