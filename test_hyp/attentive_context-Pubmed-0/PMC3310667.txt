further studies are needed to confirm the magnitude and determinants of the association between female gender and xdr tb .
factors associated with exposure to drug - resistant tb strains , including location and duration of exposure , could explain the association of xdr tb and female gender .
on univariate analysis , hiv status , art ( among hiv - infected ) , female gender , previous tb treatment , and year of admission to kgvh were significantly associated with xdr tb ( table 2 ) . on multivariate analysis ,
similarly , in cohorts from latvia , peru , and russia , lower percentages of patients with mdr tb ( 17%40% ) and xdr tb ( 29%35% ) were female ( 1214 ) .
only female gender ( or 1.38 , 95% ci 1.111.73 ) , previous tb treatment ( or 2.16 , 95% ci 1.094.28 ) , and year of admission were independently associated with xdr tb . in the hiv strata ,
gender differences in drug - resistant tb in areas of hiv endemicity and low prevalence suggest a possible effect of the aids epidemic on prevalence of drug - resistant tb in women .
briefly , we retrospectively reviewed adult mdr tb and xdr tb patients admitted during 20032008 for treatment initiation to king george v hospital ( kgvh ) , a public tb - referral hospital in kwazulu - natal .
