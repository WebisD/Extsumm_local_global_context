in conclusion , the lowered expression of gpx3 and elevated expression of aldh1a3 in ac and sc / asc subtypes of gbc are important biological markers for the metastasis , invasion , and maybe prognosis of gallbladder cancer .
moreover , no study so far has systemically compared the clinical , pathological , and molecular differences between the rare sc / asc subtype and the common ac subtype of gallbladder cancers ( gbc ) . in this study
our preliminary study using microarray assay showed a 24-fold increase in aldh1a3 level and 23-fold decrease in gpx3 in gbc - sd cells compared to normal gbc epithelial cells ( data not shown ) . in this study , the expression of aldh1a3 and gpx3 in surgically resected specimens , including ac and sc / asc , was examined by immunohistochemistry .
we acknowledge that although positive aldh1a3 expression or negative gpx3 expression significantly correlated the shorter survival in both sc / asc and ac patients , their regression coefficients or relative risk showed that the impact of positive aldh1a3 expression or negative gpx3 expression on survival was small when compared with differences in tumor size , invasion , and differentiation .
