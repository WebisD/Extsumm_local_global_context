oroantral fistula ( oaf ) is an abnormal communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus .
this case is good learning lesson for clinicians and histopathologists for stepwise approach in diagnosing oaf associated with sinus disease .
many times this aspect is overlooked and simply the diagnosis of non - specific maxillary sinusitis is given , which leads to improper treatment .
the sinus pathology is a predisposing factor for chronic non - healing nature of oaf .
it is understood that sinus pathology should be primarily treated for the successful closure of oaf . for the proper treatment of sinus disease identification of causative agent ( pathogen )
the case we present here is a 34-year - old female patient [ figure 1a ] who was complaining about non - healing opening in the upper left front region and exposure of root of one tooth .
the chronic long standing nature of oaf may be due to fungal infection like mucormycosis .
the chances of occurrence of oroantral communication increases , if there is an underlying peripical infection or a preexisting sinus disease .
the lesion started as a small swelling in the left maxillary anterior vestibular area in the region of canine eminence .
