lastly collagenous fibers since the last century.3,6,14,16,17 the dml is a free ligament , lying between the malleus and the tmj,5,8,12,18 which was shown to have a total structural difference from the aml.19 these ligaments were exposed to various traction and stretching tests in the cadaveric studies to discover whether they were responsible for mallear mobility by experimental simulation of discal or condylar translation.6,9,1719 a number of researches supposed that these ligaments were comprised of collagenous fibres9,12 whereas the others supported that only fibro - elastic fibres could transmit traction forces of tmj and cause mobility of the mallear ossicle.6,8 for that reason , we conducted a histological study on the ligaments between the ad and the malleus to clarify the weight of histological properties on mobility of the mallear ossicle in the middle ear .
a close relationship between tmj and structures of the middle ear110 has been explained by the presence of the anterior mallear ligament ( aml ) , the sphenomandibular ligament ( sml ) and the discomallear ligament ( dml).2,3,8,1113 in the past , aml was accepted as an initial ligament lying between the middle ear and articular disc ( ad ) of tmj.13 however , further investigations discovered that two distinct ligaments form the aml.12 the anatomic relations and functional properties of dml , aml , and sml are described comprehensively in well - documented studies.5,8,12,14 on the other hand , different opinions exist about histological characteristics of these ligaments.6,8,9,12,1417 various investigators have recognized aml to be consisted of muscular fibers , fibrotic tissue bands , fibro - elastic bands and
