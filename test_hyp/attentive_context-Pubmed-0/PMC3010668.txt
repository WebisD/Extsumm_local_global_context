we hypothesize that future study will demonstrate improved sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of contact endoscopy in the diagnosis of head and neck tumors .
most significantly , for the prediction of persistent and recurrent disease , sensitivity and specificity for ce was 100% with an accuracy of 92.1% .  
contact endoscopy and its efficacy in head and neck oncology , advantages , limitations , and future potential diagnostic utility will be briefly reviewed in this article .
the literature search was conducted using the following key terms :  contact endoscopy  ,  contact microlaryngoscopy  ,  aminolevulinic acid induced fluorecence  ,  autofluorescence  ,  confocal endomicroscopy  ,  oral mucosa  ,  oral cavity  , 
, ce represents a promising optical technology that may afford reliable , accurate , and noninvasive in vivo assessment of cytological pathology . prospective investigation with ce
thus , based on their computer - assisted analysis of ce images , their sensitivity was 91% and specificity 81% .
the vast majority of cancers in the oral cavity and in the head and neck are squamous cell carcinomas ( sccs ) .
, ce appears to have good sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy as a noninvasive method for distinguishing between benign and malignant mucosal lesions in the head and neck .
