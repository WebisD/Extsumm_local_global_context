although these results highlight the potential benefits of tailored diabetes prevention strategies directed at those specific factors that are most likely to increase the risk of diabetes among each racial / ethnic group , it is prudent to recommend avoidance of weight gain , weight loss , a healthy diet , and adequate levels of physical activity to all postmenopausal women for the purpose of diabetes risk reduction .
both bmi and waist circumference were found to be related to prevalent diabetes , and interval changes were associated with risk of incident disease . because waist circumference reflects centralized obesity , and the propensity toward large waist circumference varies according to race / ethnicity , its effect may differ from that of bmi ( 17,18 ) . although bmi and waist circumference among asian , postmenopausal women in the whi were relatively lower than whites , asians were at higher risk of diabetes at lower levels of bmi and with smaller waist circumferences ( i.e. , by 44 and 29% , respectively ) compared with whites , a result consistent with that seen in the multi - ethnic study of atherosclerosis ( 19 ) .
whites , blacks , and hispanics with all factors in the low - risk category ( 4.0 , 1.1 , and 2.2% ) had 60 , 69 , and 63% lower risk for incident diabetes ( table 3 ) .
