this study aims to assess the knowledge about toxoplasmosis by doctors and nurses involved in prenatal care at public health units in brazil .
finally , the authors suggest that similar surveys shall be conducted in other endemic regions and with larger populations . the establishment of a cutoff for the number of correct answers can be a useful tool for a possible intervention , providing support to actions for continuing education about pregnancy and congenital toxoplasmosis for these occupational categories .
, the authors observed that the majority ( 81.3% ) of the women sent to a referral service with a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis were coming from public health units and that for only 16% of them treatment was initiated at the origin unit .
of the 118 professionals who participated in the study , 112 respondents completed the questionnaire ( 61 physicians and 56 nurses ) , and six of them did not agree to respond the questionnaire .  
eleven ( 15.3% ) respondents reported having provided care to pregnant women with toxoplasmosis in the last 12 months , two times the percentage already considered high in a study conducted in the united states , implying that a considerable proportion of doctors and nurses encounter over their lives with at least one case of a pregnant woman with toxoplasmosis . the greatest number of correct answers among the professionals with less training time is consistent with the literature that indicates an inverse correlation between knowledge and years of professional practice , justifying the need for recertification exams in some countries   .
