indeed , there is documented evidence as to the efficacy of stimulating this point to alleviate chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) , postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) and motion sickness , both with acupuncture and acupressure . however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no studies in indexed medical literature as to the efficacy of treating pc6 acupoint for gastrointestinal symptoms in migraine attacks and particularly for nausea . therefore , our preliminary study aimed at verifying if pressure applied to the point pc6 was effective on the presence of nausea during migraine attacks .
even when the fact that our study is both preliminary and open is taken into consideration , the results obtained seem to be encouraging and advocate the continuous application of pc6 acupressure in all migraine attacks with the accompanying symptom of nausea .
the friedman test for repeated measures showed a highly statistically significant reduction in the intensity of nausea in the sb group ( p  <  0.001 ) during treatment ( at t1 , t2 , t3 and t4 ) .
the average nausea scores drop in the sb phase from 6.36    0.35 in t0 , to 4.60    0.39 in t1 , to 3.11    0.40 in t2 , to 1.88    0.31 in t3 and to 0.92    0.22 in t4 . at each time step taken into consideration after the application of the sea - bands , there was a statistically significant improvement over the non - treated phases .
