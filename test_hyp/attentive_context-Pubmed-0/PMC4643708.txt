the goal of our retrospective study of over 1361 patients was to compare the stone - free rates , steinstrasse formation , treatment efficacy and complications between patients with renal pelvic stones with and without pre - swl stent and to contribute to medical literature based on real life experiences .
the distribution of patients with and without stent placement according to steinstrasse formation was 6.7% and 5.8% ( p = 0.692 ) in group 1 , 11.4% and 15.8% ( p = 0.431 ) in group 2 , and 26% and 22.5% ( p = 0.500 ) in group 3 , respectively .
the average number of sessions was found to be significantly higher among the patients with stent placement in all groups ( group 1 : p = 0.022 ; group 2 and 3 : p = 0.000 ) , while the proportion of stone - free patients was similar across patients with and without stent placement in group 1 ( 86.4% and 73.3% ; p = 0.06 ) , a significant difference was observed in group 2 ( without stent 80.2% vs. with stent 56.8% ; p= 0.000 ) and group 3 ( without stent 75.1% vs. with stent 64.4% ; p= 0.047 ) .
