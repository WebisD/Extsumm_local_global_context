we herein report a small series of patients with suspected gastric gist treated by this new technique , termed non - exposed endoscopic wall - inversion surgery ( news ) .
the cause of the perforation was muscle injury by the endoscopic knife during mucosal cutting in case 1 and laparoscopic mucosal injury during seromuscular cutting in case 3.table  2operative data of our seriescase no.en bloc resectionperforationoperation time ( min)blood loss ( ml)postoperative hospital stay ( days)complications1yesyes397307none2yes(conversion)2922507none3yesyes3572508none4yesno265508none5yesno1901007none6yesno14007none operative data of our series in case 2 , we converted the procedure , because of poor recognition of the tumor margin , to endoscopic full - thickness resection with subsequent laparoscopic suture closure of an iatrogenic gastric defect .
the mean operation time and blood loss were 349  min and 177  ml in the first three cases ; in the latter three cases , these were 198  min and 50  ml , respectively .
between july 2011 and september 2012 , we performed news on six patients with suspected small gastric gist . tumors of the exophytic growth type were excluded .
third , upper limit of tumor size safely extracted orally should be meticulously evaluated . in conclusion , a new laparoendoscopic technique , news ,
