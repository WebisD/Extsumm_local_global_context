the results of the present study of the reactions of no with some 22 aldehydes , compromising several n - alkanals , several branched chain alkanals , and several alkenals , indicates that most of the reactions result in multiple ion products , but common ( mh ) product ions are seen that result from hydride ion transfer with the fractional abundance of these ions increasing with the alkanal molecular mass .
more specifically , alkanals exhibited a higher degree of fragmentation than the alkenals and the branched aldehydes dissociated most commonly at the position 2 . it must be emphasized that these ion product distributions will surely depend on the actual value of e / n used in the sri - tof - ms instrument . whilst increasing the humidity of the sample / carrier gas had little effect on the product ion branching ratios , such serious fragmentation limits the value of sri - tof - ms using no reagent ions for the identification of aldehydes , especially when more than one of these compounds occur together in real samples such as exhaled breath and the headspace of biological fluids .
a series of hydrocarbon ions , cnhm , appear at widely differing percentages of the total ion products at m / z values that reflect the complexity ( atomicity ) of the aldehyde molecules .
