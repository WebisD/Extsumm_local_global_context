we 
 thus show that it is possible to develop enzyme - responsive pa systems 
 with pronounced nanostructure transitions , leading in turn to macroscopic 
 changes in the sample transparency .
the pas corresponding 
 to cleaved products c16-kkf and c16-kkff are 
 shown to self - assemble into spherical micelles , quite distinct from 
 the nanotubes / helical ribbons formed by c16-kkffvlk .
, we investigate the influence of the 
 model serine protease 
 -chymotrypsin on the self - assembly of the pa c16-kkffvlk .
specifically , release of 
 micelles in response to enzymatic degradation of extended nanostructures 
 ( which have been shown to offer enhanced circulation 
 times in vivo ) may be useful in delivery of actives .
the peptide amphiphile ( pa ) has been designed based on 
 the klvff core motif from the amyloid beta ( a ) peptide .
we have shown that the pas corresponding to 
 the cleavage products 
 c16-kkf and c16-kkff assemble into very different 
 structures than the parent pa which forms nanotubes and helical ribbons 
 at room temperature .
this released a hexapeptide ( containing a c - terminal f ) along with 
 peg with an n - terminal f residue . this proof - of - principle work established 
 a possible route to create an enzyme - responsive delivery system based 
 on peg - coated particles which have relevance to biological applications 
 since peg provides a sterically stabilized corona , enabling enhanced 
 in vivo stability . here
