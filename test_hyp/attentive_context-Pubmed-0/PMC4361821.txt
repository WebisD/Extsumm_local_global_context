our study also confirmed that adhd subtypes are different in terms of perseveration and response inhibition domains ; adhd - c type showed more deficits in perseveration and response inhibition .
data analysis showed that adhd and normal group were significantly different in terms of perseverative responses , perseverative errors and total errors on wsct ( tables 2 and 3 ) as shown in table 4 , adhd subtypes were significantly different in terms of perseverative responses ( p 0/01 ) and perseverative errors ( p0/001 ) . based on scheffe s test ,
adhd - h was not different from adhd - i and adhd - c but there were significant differences between adhd - i and adhd - c in terms of perseverative responses and perseverative errors .
investigated the executive function in 94 children with adhd ( without any co - morbid disorder ) in terms of subtype and gender using five tests of the wisconsin card sorting test , the stroop color - word test , the matching familiar figures test , the trail making test , and the tower of london .
the lack of any co - morbidity in children with adhd showed that the impairments in executive function were obviously found in adhd , particularly in the adhd - c , so providing support for barkley s theory of adhd ( 27 ) .
