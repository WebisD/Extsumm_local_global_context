these data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus .
, we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains .
three - dimensional views of influenza ha proteins highlighting amino acid changes in a representative nepal isolate and the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strains are shown in figure 3a and b , respectively .
all viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) .
unrooted phylogenetic analysis of ha1 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences from 26 nepal isolates and h3n2 vaccine and reference strains .
most of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain .
