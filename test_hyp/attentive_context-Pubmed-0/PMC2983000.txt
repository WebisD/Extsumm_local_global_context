specific areas of particular interest for these new agents include the treatment of patients with cancer and vte , for whom long term treatment with lmwh is currently recommended and for whom an oral agent with a low propensity for drug - drug interactions could represent the ideal therapy , and of course the long term treatment of patients with unprovoked vte , where the complex balance between benefits and risks of the currently available drugs could be simplified with the use of more practical agents .
deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) and pulmonary embolism ( pe ) are important pathologies that affect apparently healthy individuals as well as medical or surgical patients .
thus , patients with vte could be treated with a single oral agent right after the objective diagnosis of the disease .
therapeutic objectives are essentially the prevention of thrombus extension and embolization , and the prevention of recurrent episodes of venous thromboembolism ( vte ) to reduce the risk of fatal pulmonary emboli . despite the availability of different treatment strategies ,
patients need to start treatment as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed by objective testing , and because anticoagulant drugs with a rapid onset of action are needed in this phase , three parenteral therapeutic options are currently available for initial treatment : unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) , low - molecular - weight heparin ( lmwh ) , and fondaparinux .
