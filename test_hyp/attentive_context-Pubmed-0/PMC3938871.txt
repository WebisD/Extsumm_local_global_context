, we investigated the outcomes of laparoscopic vsg as a stand - alone procedure and compare them with those of single - stage laparoscopic bpd / ds in morbidly obese patients .
a prospectively maintained database of 100 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic vsg ( group 1 ) and 100 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic bpd / ds ( group 2 ) by two bariatric surgeons in a large independent teaching hospital was retrospectively reviewed .
we , therefore , recommend single - stage laparoscopic bpd / ds in patients with a high bmi , in an attempt to achieve the target bmi of less than 35 kg / m postoperatively .
the weight loss , however , promptly reached statistical difference at the 6-month interval ( 45.4 vs. 52.4% , p < 0.05 ) , with the bpd / ds served as the more effective weight loss operation .
patients in group 1 were older than those in group 2 ( 50.8 vs. 46.4 years ; p < 0.05 ) , although gender distribution ( female predominance ) , average bmi ( 48.8 vs. 51.9 kg / m ; p > 0.05 ) , and number of obesity - related comorbidities ( 7.1 vs. 6.8 ; p > 0.05 ) were comparable [ table 1 ] .
