in addition , in this case , augmentation cystoplasty was performed to strengthen the atrophied bladder following tuberculosis .
failed treatment of encrusted pyelitis in a transplanted kidney can cause graft failure or nephrectomy . to overcome urinary stasis with encrusted pyelitis in a transplanted kidney , we report surgical treatment by ileo - pelvic anastomosis without nephrectomy .
a 51-year - old female patient received a kidney from her sister after a double nephrectomy owing to renal tuberculosis 12 years previously . at that time , the transplanted ureter was anastomosed to the ileum in the left lower abdomen with an ileal conduit on the opposite side .
in addition , the augmentation cystoplasty technique is useful for increasing bladder capacity that has been diminished by renal tuberculosis ( fig .
corynebacterium urealyticum , a gram - positive bacillus , has been identified as the most frequent causative pathogen .
the most common causative agent in the formation of infection stones is a urease - positive urinary tract infection .
urinary stasis is highly likely to contribute to stone formation , because large - scale spontaneous precipitation of crystals occurs when a critical concentration ( e.g. , supersaturation ) is exceeded .
