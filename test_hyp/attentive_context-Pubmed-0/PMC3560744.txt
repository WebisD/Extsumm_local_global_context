the second aim was to study in this group the correlation of classifying parameter of the gdx vcc device ( in accordance with internal normative databases ) the nfi ( nerve fibre index ) , which allocates the results to groups 
the purpose of our study was to compare different types of optical coherence tomographs with scanning laser polarimeter in terms of measurements of the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in patients with advanced primary open - angle glaucoma .
statistical analysis included the results of measurements of retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in the upper and lower sectors ( defects in these regions are most characteristic for glaucoma ) ; total , mean thickness of nerve fibre layer in the entire examined area ; and the nfi ( nerve fibre index ) , which describes the probability of glaucoma on the basis of collective analysis of all parameters of examination .
the parameters of the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness are highly correlated between the gdx and oct stratus and 3d oct-1000 , especially in terms of nerve fibre layer mean thickness , nerve fibre layer thickness in the upper sector , and correlation of nfi ( gdx ) with mean nerve fibre layer thickness in oct examinations ( table 1 ) .
