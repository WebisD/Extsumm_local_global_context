notably , the affinities measured for the oligosaccharides of the ganglioside 
 ligands by esi - ms are comparable in magnitude to those reported for 
 the oligosaccharides of known hbga receptors .
taken 
 together , the results of esi - ms and elisa measurements performed 
 on two human novs representing two different genogroups ( gi and gii ) 
 provide the first experimental evidence of interactions between human 
 novs and gangliosides and sialic acid - containing glycoconjugates . 

these experimental data 
 demonstrate sialic acid - containing oligosaccharides as alternative 
 ( to hbgas ) ligands for human novs and suggest a new mechanism of human 
 nov 
host interaction , one that involves hbga and sialic acid - containing 
 oligosaccharide receptors and co - receptors for attachment and penetration 
 into host cells and opens a new direction in human nov research .
further 
 studies to characterize the role of cell surface sialic acids / gangliosides 
 in the early stage of viral infection and its potential coordination 
 with hbgas for viral attachment and/or entry are needed .
, we report the first experimental evidence 
 that human novs 
 recognize sialic acid - containing glycosphingolipids ( gangliosides ) . 
 the catch - and - release electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( car - esi - ms ) 
 assay was used to screen a library of 
 gangliosides against the p particle of human nov va387 ( gii.4 ) .
