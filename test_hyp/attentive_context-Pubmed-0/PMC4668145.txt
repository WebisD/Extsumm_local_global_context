therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate the 
 effect of pesf application on sensation of muscle soreness and muscle strength after 
 eccentric exercise .
the main finding of the present investigation was that pesf application tended to reduce 
 muscle soreness scores without significantly affecting ck increase and jump performance 
 decrease . to the best of our knowledge ,
there was a trend toward significant differences in delta values (  = 
 after values ( i.e. 45  min , 24 h , and 48  h after ) minus pre value ) between treatments 
 ( pesf vs. sham ) . shows values for ck , muscle soreness score , and jump height in the courses of 
 the pesf and sham treatments .
two participants ( one male and one 
 female ) had to be excluded from the final analysis , one because of a pre - start muscle 
 soreness score of already 4 and one because of a pre - start ck value of 333 u / l . therefore , 7 
 participants ( 4 males and 3 females ; weight , height , and age : 74.35.7  kg and 71.05.3  kg , 
 183.09.9  cm and 172.36.4  cm , and 26.52.4  years and 24.31.2  years , respectively ) were 
 included in the final analysis .
