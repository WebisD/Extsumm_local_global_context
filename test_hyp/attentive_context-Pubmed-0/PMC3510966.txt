we aimed to estimate the frequency of regulatory t cells in recently diagnosed diabetes in children attending assiut children university hospital , egypt .

 the percentages of regulatory t cells were assessed in the peripheral blood but not at the site of affection ( pancreas and/or draining lymph nodes).the distinction of regulatory t cells by a flow cytometry including - high expression of cd25 antigen is very subjective and can result in different findings from different laboratories .

different studies  had recently reported findings related to the frequency and function of regulatory t cells in t1d , but their results represents a somewhat conflicting body of findings .
the frequency of cd4cd25 foxp3 was positively correlated with age of the patients ( r = 0.585 , p < 0.000 ) , and the level of insulin c peptide ( r = 682 , p < 0.000 ) [ figures 2 and 3 ] .
