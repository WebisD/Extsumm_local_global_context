a 36yearold woman was transferred to our hospital for further investigation and management of a subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) .
the fluid management in this case is rendered more complex due to the patient having poor shortterm memory and the subtropical climate in queensland , australia .
maintenance of a normal serum sodium concentration is dependent on both an intact thirst sensation and the action of arginine vasopressin ( avp ) , also known as antidiuretic hormone .
she had initially presented to the emergency department following a syncopal episode on a background of a 2day history of a severe frontal headache associated with nausea and vomiting .
herein , we report the case of adipsic diabetes insipidus following anterior communicating artery clipping . at presentation , the patient had no perception of thirst despite the presence of significant hypernatremia .
aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery and proximal a2 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery  ( a )
thirst osmoreceptors and cell bodies containing avp overlap in location in the hypothalamus and share a common blood supply through branches of the anterior communicating artery 1 . thus , disruption of this blood supply can result in both lack of thirst and avp synthesis , in response to appropriate stimuli of hypernatremia and hyperosmolality .
