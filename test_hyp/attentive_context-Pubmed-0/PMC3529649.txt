unique and highly tunable optical properties , when gold nanostructures are exposed to light at their resonance wavelength , the conduction band electrons at the gold surface generate a collective coherent oscillation , resulting in strong light absorption or light scattering of gold . the absorbed light can be converted into localized heat , which can be readily employed for therapy based on photothermal destruction of cancer cells.710 pitsillides et al first reported the photothermal therapy in lymphocytes with a short pulsed laser in the presence of gold nanoparticle immunoconjugates in 2003.11 zharov et al reported gold - induced thermal destruction of cancer cells using a nanosecond laser.12,13 research on the use of gold in cancer treatment has also been carried out by el - sayed et al.10,14 several studies have reported on the feasibility and efficiency of tumor - specific targeting of gold nanostructures for photothermal cancer therapy , such as gold nanorods,15 nanoshells,5,16 and nanocages.17 in this study , on the basis of successfully synthesizing gold nanoparticle - antibody conjugates , l-428 hodgkin s cell - killing experiments induced by the photothermal effect of gold nanoparticles were implemented . under laser irradiation , through specific targeting of ligands to receptors , light strongly absorbed by gold is transferred to the antibody molecules and the cell environment , so that the very high killing efficiency of cancer cells can be achieved .
