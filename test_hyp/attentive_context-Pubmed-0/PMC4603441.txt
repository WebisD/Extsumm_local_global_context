one of the most serious adverse events reported was irreversible renal allograft dysfunction due to malakoplakia in a renal transplant recipient with e. coli infection , pyelonephritis , and bacteremia.14 in an allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient , pleural malakoplakia caused by r. equi , presenting with a large tumor mass , required a lobectomy.12 in patients with residual disease , successful results have been reported by treating the underlying infection , reducing immunosuppression , improving the bactericidal activity of monocytes with a cholinergic agonist , such as bethanechol , and administering a multivitamin supplement.4,15,16 this is the first report of malakoplakia occurring after m. simiae infection .
her hospital course was complicated by wound infection / dehiscence , with the formation of an enterocutaneous fistula .
our patient had an abnormal host immune response to infection , malakoplakia , which occurred after m. simiae infection , a condition that has not been previously described in the literature .
gutmann bodies around the undigested bacteria.2 the most common infectious etiologies described are bacteria , such as escherichia coli , rhodococcus equi , pasteurella multocida , and mycobacterium tuberculosis.211 malakoplakia often occurs in immunocompromised patients , such as those with aids , organ transplant recipients ( mostly solid organ transplants ) , and in one case a patient who had undergone stem cell transplantation.5,1114 malakoplakia affecting a major organ could result in various organ dysfunctions .
