the nomogram offers an easy tool with which to select the optimal number of prostate biopsy cores on the basis of patient age and total prostate volume . with this biopsy strategy
the group of patients with psa scores > 10 ng / ml had a detection rate of 50% ( 13 of 26 ) .
< 10 ng / ml , the detection rate was 14.9% ( 14 of 94 patients ) .
the mean psa score was 13.42 ng / ml , and the mean number of cores obtained was 9.683.1 . according to the vn , 27 out of a total of 120 patients had pca , for a detection rate of 22.5% . in the group of patients with psa scores
with approval from our institutional review board , 120 men were enrolled prospectively between january 2006 and june 2007 .
the study population consisted of consecutive referrals for evaluation of elevated psa scores ( > 4 ng / ml ) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination ( dre ) findings .
with the use of the vn , our pca detection rate of 22.5% is comparable to published data for asian patients .
histopathologic features presented on prostate biopsy in 27 pca patients whose gleason scores were 3 + 3 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 4 + 4 , and 4 + 5 in 11.1% ( 3 patients ) , 37.0% ( 10 ) , 29.6% ( 8) , 18.5% ( 5 ) , and 3.7% ( 1 ) respectively ( fig .
