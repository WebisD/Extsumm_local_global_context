therefore , this study evaluated the effects of cutting efficacy of different diamond burs on the microleakage of resin composite restorations using total etch and self etch adhesive systems , and it also determined whether or not bur cutting efficacy had an impact on the results .
so long term use of burs may result in an increased microleakage of composite resin restorations . on the other hand ,
in conclusion , the cutting efficiency of bur had a great increasing effect on microleakage of composite resin restorations .
ninety non - carious extracted human third molars , stored in 0/2% thymol solution after extraction , were cleaned of calculus , soft tissue and debris with hand instrumentation . in order to omit the inter - operator bias ,
the mann - whitney test was used to test for differences in microleakage between pairs of groups in gingival and occlusal margins .
the kruskal - wallis for non parametric data was used to analyze inter group comparisons of microleakage , while mann - whitney u and wilcoxon w tests with bonferoni s correction were used to test for differences in microleakage between pairs of groups in dentin and enamel margins .
