it imposes a large burden on society that is growing larger in terms of mortality or morbidity , quality - of - life and costs .
resistant hypertension is defined as persistent elevation of blood pressure ( bp ) above the goal in spite of concurrent use of three to four antihypertensive agents of different classes at maximally tolerated doses including a diuretic .
patients with resistant hypertension are at increased risk of stroke , cardiovascular ( cv ) disease , and chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) .
primary hyperaldosteronism , renal vascular hypertension , and ckd are the most common secondary causes of resistant hypertension .
adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , such as spironolactone or epleronone , has been shown to reduce resistant hypertension in patients with primary aldosteronism especially those with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia , which has been found to be a contributing factor in about two thirds of cases of primary aldosteronism . in this study ,
as defined , resistant hypertension may also include patients whose bp is controlled with the use of more than three medications .
renal nerve ablation is preserved for patients who fail to response to aggressive antihypertensive drug therapy .
