could mediate in inflammatory cytokines regulation , we study the effect of our extracts on ox - ldl - activated thp-1 macrophages , measuring the expression and release of several inflammatory mediators .
designed to identify natural compounds with anti - inflammatory potential , we have studied thyme oils from three different species ( thymus vulgaris , thymus zygis , and thymus hyemalis ) . to determinate whether thyme oils could have immunomodulation properties and
results observed in this work suggest that supercritical thyme s1 and s2 fraction oils from thymus vulgaris , thymus zygis , and thymus hyemalis may act as effective inhibitors of oxldl - induced proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf- , il-1 , and il-6 ) secretion , and also as enhancers of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il-10 secretion , in macrophage thp-1 cells . in summary , co2 supercritical thyme extracts showed anti - inflammatory properties by ( a ) reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines , and ( b ) increasing the anti - inflammatory secretion in activated macrophages .
borneol , one of the major compounds present in essential oils from sage , has been described as anti - inflammatory since its dietary supplementation significantly decreases the concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1 and il-6 in mice .
