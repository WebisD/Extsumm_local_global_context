three metacercariae of clinostomatids were discovered to be the parasites associated with the t. zilii of opi lake .
therefore , investigation into its parasites and description of co  infection by three clinostomum species was necessary .
in addition , the infection of the buccal cavity had the highest infection than the other two microhabitats of the eye and skin . implications of their presence caused pronounced inflammation as well as roughening of the skin by the encysting metacercariae .
rank - abundance and species diversity of the parasites were determined using quantitative analysis of shannon - wienner index ( 14 ) .
these excysted forms caused serious damages to the infected fish as they burrowed through the organs of the host .
damages to the skin , blindness and bumps on the skin could affect the palatability and marketability of the infected fish as well as the acceptance of fish as the primary source of animal protein .
the present study is the first record of co  infection of three clinostomum species and report on the parasites of opi lake .
this is because ingestion of under cooked fish with clinostomum infection results in the attachment of the trematode on the pharynx .
