although we can not definitively attribute the cause of death of this whale to wnv , the observed lesions are consistent with those caused by wnv in other animals .
these findings broaden the known host tropism of wnv to include cetaceans in addition to previously known pinnipeds .
until the implications of this infection in marine mammals are better understood , biologists and veterinarians working with cetaceans should consider this possibility .
finally , our study demonstrates the broad applicability of using panviral microarray - based diagnostics .
even though pcr diagnostics are well developed for wnv , the agent was not initially considered as a potential pathogen in this species .
in 2007 , a 14-year - old male killer whale at a marine park in san antonio , texas , usa , died suddenly without notable premonitory signs . on gross examination , mild multifocal meningeal hyperemia and petechial parenchymal hemorrhage
differences in wnv prevalence or mosquito numbers may have played a role in the different serologic results .
the serologic results demonstrate that subclinical infections can occur and that exposure can be variable .
predominant lesions in the lungs were areas of chronic and active abscessation amid a focally extensive area of mixed inflammation and fibrosis .
