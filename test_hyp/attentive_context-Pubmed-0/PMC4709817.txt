moreover , a statistically significant change was observed in the intervention group s mean score of aggression after the intervention ( p<0.02 ) ; also , such a difference was found in the control group ( p<0.023 ) , but the results showed that the mean score of aggression in the control group was increased in the post - test compared to the pre - test .
therefore , the present study has focused on all forms of aggression and aims to identify the effect of reinforcement behavior therapy by kindergarten teachers on all types of aggressive behavior among kindergarten and preschool children .
yet , the difference between the intervention and control groups was statistically significant only for physical and verbal aggression subscales ( p=0.02 , p<0.01 ) ( table 4 ) . comparison of the frequency distribution of the participants in the intervention and control groups based on demographic characteristics x = chi - square ; f = fisher exact test comparison of the changes in the mean scores of various types of aggression in the preschoolers in the intervention and control groups before and after the intervention
it was a cluster randomized control trial research with a pretest / post - test design and control group .
