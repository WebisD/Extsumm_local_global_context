the aim of this study was to quantify the inflammatory infiltrate in the heart and in the encephalon of the elderly with cysticercosis .
furthermore , there are differences , concerning gender , in the intensity of the inflammatory response due to cysticerci in the heart and brain parenchyma during senescence . even during this period , women continue to have a more intense response to the parasitosis .
in this study , we showed that the non - elderly had significantly more cardiac and encephalic inflammation than the elderly , and that such inflammatory infiltrate decreases with age and depends upon the evolutionary stage of the cysticercus .
heart and brain weights of non - elderly patients with cysticercosis were found to be higher than those of the elderly group with the parasitosis , without significant difference .
male and caucasian patients predominated in both groups , and analysis of nutritional status showed that the non - elderly had an average body mass index ( bmi ) of 21.2  4.4  kg / m and that the elderly with cysticercosis had an average bmi of 20.2  9.9 
when contrasting both genders of the non - elderly group , male patients had more inflammation , yet without any significant difference ( table 3 ) . a positive and not significant correlation between encephalic inflammation and cardiac inflammation was found ( r = 0 , 032 ; p = 0,247 ) , as well as a negative correlation between age and encephalic inflammation ( r = 0,518 ; p = 0,03 ) or cardiac inflammation ( r = 0,385 ; p = 0,186 ) in male group .
