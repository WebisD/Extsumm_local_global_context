thus , the finding of an alu element in amphioxus raises the question whether amphioxus and primates are an example of convergent evolution or whether they both arose from an alu element in the ancestral chordate .
the class i elements include the long terminal repeat ( ltr ) retrotransposons , the non - ltr retrotransposons and the short interspersed nucleotide elements ( sines ) 1 , 2 .
the surprising finding of the present work is not that amphioxus has transposable elements or that this element is a sine , which are common in eukaryotic genomes , but that it contains three alui sites , two of which are in tandem .
the finding of an alu element in the amphioxus genome that is present in the regulatory dna of some , but not all , alleles of the foxd gene and in the regulatory regions of other genes raises questions both about the evolution of sines in chordates and suggests that the insertion of such sines into regulatory dna could mediate evolution of cis - regulatory regions .
there is some evidence for positive selection for such transposon - mediate changes in regulatory dna 21 , 22 , and it may become evident with the sequencing of the genomes of more organisms like amphioxus with relatively short life cycles are sequenced to what extent such changes in regulatory dna mediate large evolutionary changes .
