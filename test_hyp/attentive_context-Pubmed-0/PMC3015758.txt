a 54-year - old female with a history of biliary colic was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy . 

presented herein is a case in which an aberrant right hepatic artery ( rha ) passes anterior to the infundibulum and fundus of the gallbladder and courses to an unusually anterior hepatic entry .
the cystic artery then wrapped postero - laterally on the gallbladder 's surface to its neck .
laparoscopic dissection revealed an aberrant right hepatic artery ( rha ) anterior to the infundibulum and fundus of the gallbladder .
the origins and paths of both the cystic and right hepatic arteries have several documented anomalies . 
 we are unaware of any reports of an rha that transverses the entire neck and fundus of the gallbladder before such an anterior hepatic entry .
further dissection revealed the cystic artery to branch laterally off this rha over the gallbladder fundus anteriorly .
after the gallbladder was removed , the aberrant rha was readily visible traveling across the gallbladder bed and entering the liver at an unusually anterior location .
this case serves as a striking reminder of the variations in extrahepatic biliary and vascular anatomy .
