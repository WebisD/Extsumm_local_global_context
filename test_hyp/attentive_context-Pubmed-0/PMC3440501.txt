subtotal resection ( str ) combined with rt and radiosurgery ( gkrs ) is being used increasingly as either a primary or secondary treatment for patients with craniopharyngioma2,12 ) .
. however , if the tumor is located near critical structures or if it recurs , subtotal resection combined with rt or gkrs may be effective both as an initial treatment for patients with a recurrent tumor and as a salvage treatment for recurrent lesions .
progression - free was 51.2 months ( range , 3 - 182 ) : 49.7 months in the patients who underwent gtr and 60.2 months in those who received str followed by rt ( table 3 ) .
the local control rate of the lesions treated with gkrs was 100% ( decreased in two patients and stable in two patients ) at the final follow - up ( mean , 75 months ) .
the mean time from the initial diagnosis until recurrence after surgery was 32.4 months ( range , 5 - 108 ) .
the clinical records of pediatric patients treated for craniopharyngiomas between december 1995 and february 2011 were reviewed .
nevertheless , the use of rt in malignant lesions in children has always posed a therapeutic dilemma ; the risk of long - term toxicity must be balanced with the risk of recurrence .
