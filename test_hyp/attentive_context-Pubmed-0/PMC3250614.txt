chronic liver diseases ( cld ) and its end - stages , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide with enormous socio - economic costs .
together , these cellular and molecular events release the enormous natural regenerative potential of the liver . in cld ,
is reflected in the complex modulation of intracellular signal transduction circuits , altered cell - cell communications and , more drastically , an altered differentiation state of most liver resident cell types . evidently , the dissection of these pathways is critical for the development of drugs and therapies .
, we will first discuss the current knowledge of cellular communication and molecular mechanisms associated with cld initiation and progression and thereafter address the role of tgf- therein .
hepatocyte damage , wound healing and tissue remodelling go awry , resulting in fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis , the platform on which hcc and deadly hepatic failure develop . at the cellular and molecular level , the multistep process of progressive cld
as is well recognised , the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor ( tgf)- plays a pivotal role in the sequence of events leading to end - stage cld , although the complexity of the underlying aberrant responses that , in the various liver cell types and at the organ level , lead to the drastic changes seen in cld and hcc is not understood in detail ( dooley et al .
