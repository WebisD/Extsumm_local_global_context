a 64-year - old man with a 15-year long history of hypertension was presented to the emergency room with a 24-hour history with symptoms of cyanosis and pain on the right upper extremity , consistent with acute ischemia .
an understanding of the clinical features and angiographic findings of ergotamine - induced ischemia is essential in early diagnosis and treatment to prevent irreversible complications .
the present case emphasizes the importance of acquiring a detailed medication history . combination of heparin , prostaglandin e1 , and sympathectomy did not prevent the progression of cyanosis in our case , but intravenous injections of nitroprusside could relieve the symptoms .

uninterrupted medication for migraine is thought to play a significant role in the development of recurrent symptoms .
people who consumed the fungus contaminated grain suffered from limb ischemia and discoloration of extremities .
nifedipine is the most potent peripheral vasodilator of the group and has been successfully used to treat ergotamine toxicity . in severe forms of ischemia refractory
ergotamine - induced vascular ischemia is rare , but potentially serious complication may be induced through two mechanisms : vasospasm and thrombus formation .
