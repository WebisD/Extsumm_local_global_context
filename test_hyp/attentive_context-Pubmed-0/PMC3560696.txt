in conclusion , although the limited size of patient cohorts and the consequent absence of rare genotypes including cyp2c9 * 3/*3 homozygous subjects make our results preliminary in nature , the study nevertheless suggests that the cyp2c9 * 3 allele might correlate with a better ldl - c lowering efficacy of fluvastatin .
furthermore , it was reported that genetic polymorphism in cholesteryl - ester transfer protein could also be associated with variable lipid response to fluvastatin , and there are snps in other genes not explicitly associated with fluvastatin transport , metabolism or receptors that impact the efficacy of the treatment .
hypercholesterolemia plays a crucial role in the development of atherosclerotic disease , which is one of the leading causes of mortality in the western world . therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl - coenzyme a ( hmg - coa ) reductase inhibitors  statins 
some of these , especially oatp2b1 , have been reported to play an important role in statin uptake into hepatocytes and were implicated in modulating the pharmacological action and efficacy of fluvastatin .
fluvastatin was well tolerated by all participants  patients did not complain spontaneously , and fluvastatin treatment had no effect on the activities of creatine kinase at the administered dose of 80 mg daily . to assess the efficacy of hypolipidemic therapy , the threshold limits were defined as follows : low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) levels between 2.23.4 mmol / l , serum total cholesterol ( tc ) levels between 3.835.2 mmol / l , and triglyceride ( tg ) levels between 0.681.69 mmol / l .
