the chemical stability at physiological ph and the enzymatic activation of the prodrugs in caco-2 , aspc-1 , and capan-2 cell homogenates were also evaluated to determine the effects of the amino acid / dipeptide promoiety structure on enzyme - mediated activation .
the feasibility of selective antiproliferative action of amino acid / dipeptide floxuridine prodrugs was also explored using cancer cells that overexpress pept1 .
, enhanced metabolic resistance and superior affinity to oligopeptide transporters of dipeptide prodrugs may facilitate their prolonged systemic circulation and enhanced therapeutic action . with its display of respectable stability in biological surrogate media and its approximately 2- to 3-fold shorter half - life in cancer cell homogenates than ones in human plasma and caco-2 cell homogenates
uptake inhibition and permeability studies were conducted with caco-2 cells as well as with aspc-1 and capan-2 cells .
have been tested to characterize the hpept1 transporter and improve its affinity , and mono amino acid ester prodrugs have been evaluated as hpept1 substrates .
the role of esterification of the hydroxyl groups in protecting glycosidic bond cleavage by thymidine phosphorylase , the rate - determining step in deprotection and in metabolic conversion of floxuridine to 5-fu , has been discussed in a previous study.(13 ) the cell proliferation studies in the pancreatic duct cancer cell lines confirmed the enhanced potency of the amino acid ester prodrugs compared to parent floxuridine . in many cases , dipeptide prodrugs exhibited better gi50 values even though the gi50 values for dipeptide monoester prodrugs in the two cell lines were not significantly different from those obtained with mono amino acid ester prodrugs .
