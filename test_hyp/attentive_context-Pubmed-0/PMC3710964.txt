hhm , which has rarely been reported in patients with cc , represents a marker of poor prognosis of the disease . in this case report , we present two cases of cc , showing the signs , symptoms , laboratory findings , and disease course consistent with hhm .
both cases indicated that hhm is refractory to medical treatment and led to a fatal outcome when it developed in a patient whose tumor showed progression upon active anticancer therapy . in conclusion , we herein report on two cases of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy associated with cc .
although the condition 's dismal prognosis can be partly overcome by more proactive treatment , its manifestation implicates massive overall disease burden and an adverse outcome when the tumor itself is not controlled .
hypercalcemia is a life threatening complication of malignant disease , and has been reported to occur in approximately 20% to 30% of patients with malignancies at some time during the course of their disease .
parathyroid hormone - related peptide ( pth - rp ) has been identified as a mediator of hhm .
cholangiocarcinoma ( cc ) is a relatively uncommon tumor , accounting for 10% to 15% of hepatobiliary malignancies and 3% of gastrointestinal tract cancers .
