we report a rare case of genetically confirmed sca type 1 ( sca1 ) with a prominent and disabling writer 's cramp .
dystonia can be encountered in a small subset of patients with sca , but task - specific dystonia ( writer 's cramp ) is extremely rare and has been reported only in association with stray cases of sca types 6 , 7 , and 14 worldwide .
the spinocerebellar ataxias ( scas ) are a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cerebellar , pyramidal , extrapyramidal , cognitive , and peripheral nerve dysfunction in variable combination .
in contrast to the usual pattern of focal or generalized dystonia reported in sca1 , our case presented with a prominent task - specific dystonia in the form of a writer 's cramp and added to the clinical spectrum of this subtype .
a review of the literature reveals that even in the sca subtypes manifesting with dystonia , task - specific dystonia such as writer 's cramp is extremely rare .
this is probably the first case report of sca1 with a task - specific dystonia or writer 's cramp .
in sca patients with writer 's cramp , the dystonia can precede , accompany or follow the onset of cerebellar ataxia . in our patient ,
