narrative elements . through tracing the relevant  master narratives  , reading the intentions , the symptoms , and evaluating alternative ( adaptive ) endings of the jack and jill story , we have seen one way of doing ethics of care narratively . a narrative approach is , of course , helpful to other methods of ethics , too , but it is a intrinsic part of an ethics of care .
ethics of care is a relatively new branch of ethics and all its features have not been firmly established and developed . here
as mentioned in the introduction , there is an ongoing discussion about whether ethics of care is an ethical theory in its own right or simply an addendum to traditional theories .
as narrativity and narrative skills are thus inseparable from caring , an ethics of care must have the resources to receive , evaluate  even create 
next , we will evaluate the core narrative ( i.e. the jack & jill case ) from two perspectives , so as to broaden our understanding of what happens .
narratives are not only therapeutic means , they are often therapy itself . listening to the other , and demonstrating the willingness and ability to facilitate , mirror , interpret and understand the words and narratives of the other , are often in themselves therapeutic activities and a direct expressions of caring .
