the study was designed to evaluate and compare the clinical eyelid parameters proposed to contribute to entropion and ectropion formation .
in unilaterally affected entropion and ectropion patients , the risk for developing a malposition in the  unaffected  lid is demonstrated by significant abnormalities when compared to the age - matched control group .
the more pronounced lower lid retractor dehiscence or disinsertion found in entropion and the poor snapback characteristics in ectropion may explain why involutional entropion and ectropion are rarely seen in opposite eyes of a single patient .
the eyes were assigned to the entropion group , ectropion group , opposite lid entropion control group ( entropion control ) , opposite lid ectropion control group ( ectropion control ) , or the age - matched control group .
 shaped insertion and the parameter of a slowed return on the snapback test were both found to be statistically significant when comparing the entropion and ectropion groups to the control group .
this study represents an attempt to synthesize the information gleaned by previous studies and develop a comprehensive protocol to assess all the potential mechanisms and related clinical findings of involutional entropion and ectropion .
eyelids with ectropion have decreased lid elasticity compared to the entropion and control groups as demonstrated with the snapback test .
