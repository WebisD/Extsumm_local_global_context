as the technology is perfected , nanomedicines can be used in the future in benign prostatic hyperplasia at the level of expression and location of proteins . as image - guiding techniques such as magnetic iron oxide nps ( fe3o4 nps )
this review has highlighted nanomedicine and nanogene therapy research in association with nanotechnology concepts for modern medicine , especially for improving the therapeutic outcomes of cancer .
are perfected , image - guided radiation therapy can be used for pca . moreover , application of nanotechnology to extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy   can enable patients to have a better quality of life and improve the survival rate in the near future .
both researchers and the pharmaceutical industry have shown particular interest in nanotechnology for medical applications with potential benefits for patients .
meeting these challenges is essential for successful application of drug - loaded nanoparticles ( nps ) in the field of pharmaceutics .
nanomedicine combines engineering , physics , biology , chemistry , mathematics , and medicine and strives to improve disease detection , imaging , and drug delivery through the use of nanodevices .
prepared nps are also used in real - time monitoring of treatment by attaching various imaging moieties that help in visualizing the distribution of nps and the drugs .
