a simple and rapid liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) method has been developed for the determination of bh4 , da , 5-ht , ne , ep , glu , and gaba in mouse brain using epsilon - acetamidocaproic acid ( aaca ) and isotopically labeled neurotransmitters as an internal standard . although it is clear that further studies are necessary to understand the physiological meaning of the different levels of bh4 and nts , this new method could be applied for tracking the changes of the endogenous bh4 and nts which are affected significantly by various stimuli or in neurodegenerative diseases   .
owing to various efficiencies and time consumption of derivatization , a simplified sample preparation using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry ( esi - ms / ms ) is widely employed to quantify the nts and their metabolites in the brains without derivatization   .
ep , glu , and gaba in the brain samples , the present study was performed using a high efficiency hilic column for bh4 and da , a luna 3   c18 ( 3.0  mm  150  mm , i.d . , 3  m ) column for 5-ht , ne , ep , glu , and gaba with reversed - phase hplc separation and an esi - ms / ms , which could minimize the sample interferences . at the same time , the multiple reactions monitoring ( mrm ) scan mode was sensitive enough to identify and quantify the bh4 and nts in this new method .
