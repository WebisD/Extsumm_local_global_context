recently , we experienced a case of pseudozyma aphidis fungaemia with invasive fungal pneumonia after reinduction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia ( aml ) . here , we describe this case and review the global literature .
rare fungi have recently been implicated in human infections ranging from colonisation to invasive fungal infections ( ifis ) in immunocompromised patients , accounting for < 10% of all isolated fungal pathogens.1 
 pseudozyma species ( spp . )
this case is worth reporting in the aspect that p. aphidis fungaemia developed during neutropenic fever with concurrent invasive fungal pneumonia in an aml patient .
infections in humans have rarely been reported after the first description as a human pathogen in 2003.3 data regarding the clinical characteristics and pathogenicity in humans remain insufficient .
, we described a case of a 51yearold male patient with aml who suffered from neutropenic fever during chemotherapy with a defined bacterial and fungal infection that was finally diagnosed as p. aphidis fungaemia and concurrent invasive fungal pneumonia without genus level identification .
mary 's hospital approved this case report and waived the need for patient consent ( no .
considering the possibility of both proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and fungal pneumonia due to pseudozyma spp .
