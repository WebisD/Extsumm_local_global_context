the relevance of trans - signaling in vivo in a number of peripheral and cns diseases is widely recognized 111 , 149 , 230 - 234 , and not surprisingly therapeutic approaches aiming to counteract il-6 effects not only focus in il-6 membrane receptor 235 - 238 but also in il-6/sil-6r complex 13 , 239 - 241 . likewise , sgp130 is also of an invaluable utility to specifically block diseases states in which trans - signaling responses exist 232 , 234 , 241 , to the extent that the molecule has recently been structurally - optimized to better antagonize trans - signaling pathologic effects 242 .
many of its effects are caused by trans - signaling , while others are mediated by the membrane receptor ; both can be essentially considered an integrated , unique system .
still , we must keep in mind that il-6 has a role in the normal brain , and interfering with them may be a significant source of concern .
finally , we need to understand in vivo what the role(s ) of il-6 are to be due to specific cellular production of and response to il-6 ; hopefully the production of floxed mice for il-6 will help to answer these questions .
