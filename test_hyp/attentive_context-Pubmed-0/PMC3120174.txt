the rate of decline of bp was greater in those patients who died than in patients who remained alive ( p < 0.001 for systolic bp ; p = 0.013 for diastolic bp ) .
in the fully adjusted model , mean systolic bp significantly increased with age ( 0.23 mmhg for each year ; p < 0.001 ) , female sex ( 1.57 mmhg ; p = 0.004 ) , african american race ( 3.14 mmhg ; p < 0.001 ) , bmi ( 0.11 mmhg for each kg / m increase ; p = 0.001 ) , and for those with renal failure or receiving dialysis ( 5.08 mmhg ; p < 0.001 ) .
our results suggest that a significant decline occurs in both systolic and diastolic bp several years before death in populations of patients with diabetes .
mean systolic bp significantly decreased with medicaid insurance ( 2.05 mmhg ; p = 0.006 ) and in those with chf ( 4.03 mmhg ; p < 0.001 ) .
systolic and diastolic bp both significantly declined before death in patients with diabetes . in an unadjusted model , mean systolic bp declined 3.1 mmhg ( 95% ci 1.94.3 ) and mean diastolic bp declined 1.6 mmhg ( 0.92.3 ) annually before death . in the adjusted model ( table 2 ) , systolic pressure decreased by 3.2 mmhg / year ( p < 0.001 ) in those who died and by 0.7 mmhg / year ( p < 0.001 ) in those who did not die ( p < 0.001 for the difference in slopes between trajectories ) .
