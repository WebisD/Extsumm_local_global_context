the autopsy result and available clinical information has to allow the forensic pathologist to prove the existence of neck and/or head trauma and establish its causal connection with ica thrombosis and exclude other , known , non - traumatic causes of the latter .
the establishment of a causal connection may be problematic or even impossible in victims who apart from traumatic injuries suffer from diseases or factors predisposing to thrombosis .
