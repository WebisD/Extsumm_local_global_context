in addition , the broad antioxidant capacity of flavocoxid and its effect on nitrite production in a cell model was determined and related to its damping of cox-2 gene expression compared to other anti - inflammatory agents .
these pleiotropic , anti - inflammatory effects of flavocoxid are discussed , correlating this in vitro characterization to in vivo safety and efficacy results in humans for the clinical management of oa .
using a variety of in vitro enzyme , cell , gene expression , and antioxidant assays , we examined the anti - inflammatory mechanism of action of flavocoxid .
flavocoxid is the only currently marketed prescription anti - inflammatory agent that modulates cox enzymes via an anti - po activity , inhibits 5-lox - mediated lt production , and has a broad , strong antioxidant activity which downregulates inducible inflammatory gene expression as well as neutralizes ros thereby preventing the conversion of aa to oxidized lipids .
when combined with a strong antioxidant capacity and previous findings on damping inflammatory gene expression   , the results presented here suggest that flavocoxid acts through an antioxidant mechanism to control inducible inflammatory gene expression in addition to modulating fatty acid processing enzymes including 5-lox .
