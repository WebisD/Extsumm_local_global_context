we determined to assess the nodal harvest from the axilla in these various contexts , within a single centre , with the same surgeons and pathologists all working in accordance with the same standardised protocols .
the goal of axillary clearance is to remove all potentially involved lymph nodes and fatty tissue , and using the number of nodes as a measure of adequacy of tissue retrieval , we have shown equivalence between each technique in our unit .
therefore , even in more surgically challenging circumstances , such as the scarred axilla of a previous slnb , surgical technique is robust in ensuring adequate clearance of the axilla .
these differences in nature of surgery performed on the breast were strongly statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) .
the mean number of positive nodes was higher in group 1 at 5.1 , compared with 3.2 and 3.52 in groups 2 and 3 , respectively , but 95% confidence intervals overlap , and no statistically significant difference was found ( figure 2 ) .
all three patient groups were statistically similar regarding both outcome measures  total number of nodes harvested from the axilla and the total number of positive nodes harvested ( table 2 and figures 1 and 2 ) .
