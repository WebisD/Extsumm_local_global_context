therefore , we aimed to assess whether constrictive physiology based on early postoperative echocardiography after off - pump coronary artery bypass graft ( opcab ) may require medical or surgical treatment to prevent constrictive pericarditis and whether it would have an effect on early mortality and morbidity of patients undergoing opcab .
between january 2008 and july 2011 , 903 patients underwent isolated opcab at yonsei cardiovascular hospital and were enrolled in this single center , randomized , retrospective study .
group a showed a low representation of women ( p=0.04 ) , a low incidence of hypertension ( p=0.03 ) , and low ejection fraction ( p=0.05 ) compared to group b. other reviewed data showed no significant differences between the two groups .
. increased blood loss and transfusion volumes during the first postoperative 24 hours were observed in group a compared to group b , but these differences were not statistically significant ( p=0.20 ) .
the results of this study suggest that patients with early postoperative constrictive physiology do not need medical or surgical treatment , and that conservative care is sufficient .
among the 903 patients included in this study , 153 ( 17% ) were diagnosed with constrictive physiology ( group a ) .
