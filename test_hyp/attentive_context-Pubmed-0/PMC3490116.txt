a healthy 15-year - old woman was admitted to the department of neurosurgery of our institution with a chief complaint of a 1-month history of headache and dizziness .
this is particularly true to our case ; the presence of giant cells with intranuclear inclusions and papillary structures was a critical clue to intraoperative frozen diagnosis .
in addition to the cytologic features , the clinical and radiologic findings are helpful for improving the diagnostic accuracy . due to a relatively smaller number of reported cases , we failed to establish the relationship between the histological pattern of gce and its prognosis . in patients with anaplastic gce , however , a poor prognosis is expected with a relatively higher rate of recurrence ( table 1 ) . in our patient , there was no disease progression or recurrence . due to a shorter length of follow - up , however , further long - term follow - up studies are warranted to predict clinical outcomes of anaplastic gce
a rare variant of ependymoma , gce poses a diagnostic challenge for the pathologists on the intraoperative frozen section as well as the permanent section .
with a retrospective review of the slides , we identified a perivasculasr pseudorosettes - like lesion .
