we report herein our initial experience and reason for conversion of less radical prostatectomy ( lessrp ) , using a homemade single - port device , to conventional lrp , with a schematic surgical illustration .
recently , laparoendoscopic single - site ( less ) surgery , by which surgical instruments can be introduced through a single incision , has improved the esthetic outcome and has replaced conventional laparoscopic surgery .
we decided to perform a radical prostatectomy under a diagnosis of localized pca ( clinical stage t2cn0m0 ) .
the patient complained of frequency intervals of 1 - 2 h and nocturia of 3 times per night . before this presentation ,
4 ) , and the pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed pca with a gleason score of 7 ( 3 + 4 ) reflecting prostatic cancer invasion ( pt3a ) . until now
after medical treatment , his serum prostate - specific antigen was 4.11 ng / ml , which was a 4-fold increase from the baseline prostate - specific antigen . he underwent a 12-core transrectal ultrasonography ( trus)-guided prostate biopsy , which showed a localized prostate cancer ( pca ) with a gleason score of 7 ( 3 + 4 ) in the bilateral peripheral zones .
