hence , this present study was carried out in the immunization clinic of a tertiary care hospital , with the objective of determining the activity time at the service points in the immunization clinic , as such clinics dealt with the most vulnerable and sensitive section of the population , for whom satisfactory preventive / promotive care was essential .
the goal for achieving universal immunization against vaccine preventable diseases requires multifaceted collated response from many stakeholders .
the fundamental philosophy of this discipline suggests that ( a ) although there are numerous ways to perform any task , one method will be superior to others , and ( b ) the superior method can be determined by observing and analyzing the time taken to carry out parts of the activity.(2 ) few such studies have been reported in the outpatient department of hospitals , and such studies based exclusively on immunization clinic of an institute is a rarity .
this study had the limitation of being observational and would have been more effective if more related variables like number of staff present at each table on different days could also have been included and interventions could have been done leading to comparisons between different time utilizations in different layout settings of the clinic or by changing other contributory factors . at the end , it may be stated that this study aims to initiate an effort to study the utilization of time at a certain health care unit with the invitation of much more in - depth analysis of the method of functioning and subsequent remedial steps for optimal functioning of the system .
