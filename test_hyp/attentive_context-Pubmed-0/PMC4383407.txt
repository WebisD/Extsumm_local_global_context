our study group recently published the 6-month data on the safety and efficacy of cxl followed by insertion of a phakic toric implantable collamer lens ( icl ) ( visian toric v4 icl ; staar surgical , monrovia , ca ) in the posterior chamber for correction of myopia and astigmatism in patients with keratoconus . in this paper , we report the long - term safety and efficacy of sequential cxl , then icl implantation , separated by 6 months , in a larger cohort of patients with moderate to severe keratoconus with moderate to severe myopia and astigmatism , and good best - corrected visual acuity .
the results of toric icl implantation 6 months after cxl at 1 year and at 2 years compare to the outcomes at 6 months in a previous study ; it is an effective and safe method of improving visual acuity and refraction in keratoconus eyes with high myopia and astigmatism and good best corrected visual acuity .
, there was significant improvement in mean udva from 1.57 logmar to 0.17 logmar ( p < 0.001 ) and mild improvement in cdva from 0.17 logmar to 0.11 logmar ( p < 0.001 ) .
