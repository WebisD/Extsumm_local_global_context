this study was conducted to evaluate the factors that motivate participation in cardiology clinical trials , as well as those leading to participant frustration .
additionally , the relative lack of understanding of the study by some of the participants was evident , indicating that the use of an informed consent form in developing countries is a complex process that needs to be reviewed by institutions participating in multi - center clinical trials .
the results of the present study indicated that the main motivation for participating in a cardiology clinical trial was the personal benefit expected by the participants in both groups .
the following were established as inclusion criteria : age between 20 and 80 years ; participation in phase ii , iii , or iv clinical trials for drug testing that were conducted in outpatient units from 2002 to 2006 ; placebo usage in the washout phase or that was compared to the tested drug ; randomization into the clinical trial and consent to participate .
the present study was a descriptive , exploratory , and quantitative study conducted in a public hospital specializing in cardiology .
two groups were then formed : group i , comprising patients who had participated in placebo - controlled trials after randomization , and group ii , comprising patients who had participated in clinical trials in which the tested drug was compared to another drug after randomization and in which the placebo was only administered during the washout period .
