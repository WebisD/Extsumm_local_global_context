the aim of this article is to review current treatments of mastitis during lactation and seek for evidence - based , best practice treatment recommendations for bovine mastitis .
the concept of evidence - based medicine has been introduced to veterinary medicine   and should apply also to treatment of mastitis . the impact on public health
intramammary infection ( mastitis ) is the most common reason for the use of antimicrobials in dairy cows .
treating subclinical mastitis with antimicrobials is generally not economical during lactation because of high treatment costs and poor efficacy . in a study with a large number of subclinical mastitis cases , the overall bacteriological cure rate for antimicrobial treatment was 75% and that for no treatment 68% . the marginal benefit applied for streptococcal mastitis only ; in mastitis due to s. aureus , antimicrobials were equal to no treatment .
studies on treating cows based on high somatic cell counts have generally shown that no effect on milk production has been achieved   in herd problems caused by very contagious bacteria such as s. aureus or streptococcus agalactiae treatment of subclinical mastitis is advised .
antimicrobials have been used to treat mastitis for more than fifty years , but consensus about the most efficient , safe , and economical treatment is still lacking .
