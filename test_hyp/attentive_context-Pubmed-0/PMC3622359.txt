we report a gaussian - based approach to deliver 
 a 
 smooth dielectric function for the entire space domain ( the macromolecule(s ) 
 and the water phase ) . to assess the effects of this development on 
 various biophysical quantities which can be computationally modeled
the correctness of 
 the approach in reflecting the expected physical properties of macromolecules 
 is demonstrated on a large set of protein structures by showing that 
 the generated smooth dielectric function results in values of about 
 67 in the protein interior and values of 2030 at the 
 protein  water interface , which is consistent with previous 
 md - based work .
one of the most common tasks 
 in computational research is to calculate the electrostatic component 
 of the solvation energy of a protein or a small molecule .
calculating the pka shift requires one to find the energy difference ( most 
 electrostatic component of the energy ) between the corresponding protein 
 with ionized and neutral groups of interest .
the possibility that the local dielectric constant associated 
 with the space taken by titratable groups ( especially in case of non - naturally 
 occurring groups ) may have to be not only a function of atomic packing 
 but to be further increased , we repeated the pka calculations with a modified gaussian - based approach : the 
 radii of titratable atoms of asp , glu , arg , and lys were artificially 
 lowered by a factor of 2 , which resulted in reduced packing and a 
 higher local dielectric constant .
