we specifically sought to investigate differences in prevention , presentation , inhospital care , acute outcomes , and use of rehabilitation services after discharge .
covariates in adjusted model include patient age , sex , and race ; patient medical history of atrial fibrillation or flutter , stroke / tia , cad / mi , carotid stenosis , diabetes mellitus , pvd , hypertension , dyslipidemia , or smoking ; arrival offhours , nihss score ; and hospital region , teaching status , number of beds , annual ischemic stroke volume , annual iv tpa volume , rurality , primary stroke center . compared with
the uninsured had 30% higher odds of dying in hospital than the privately insured , and the odds of death increased to 1.5 for the uninsured aged 65 and older ( figure  2 ; figure  s2 ) .
being uninsured increases mortality for cancer,5 , 6 trauma,7 , 8 sepsis,9 heart failure,10 and acute myocardial infarction.11 medicaid insurance status is also associated with the risk for death in several of these conditions.5 , 6 , 10 there is evidence that disability and mortality are also higher for medicaid and uninsured patients after stroke,12 , 13 with the largest and most recent study being specific to hemorrhagic strokes.14 despite the affordable care act , in the united states the uninsured rate remained at 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015.15 
  therefore , the objective of this study was to determine whether patients without insurance or with governmentsponsored insurance had worse care or outcomes in acute ischemic stroke ( is ) than the privately insured , using a large , nationally representative stroke registry .
