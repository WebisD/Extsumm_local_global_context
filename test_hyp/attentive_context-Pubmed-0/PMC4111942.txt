interestingly , there seems to be no correlation between the size of the occlusion and the neurologic outcome.1 
  recent studies have shown tcad in 1.0 to 3.7% of all blunt trauma admissions.2 
 3 in patients at risk for tcad , aggressive screening has revealed an incidence of 13 to 39% of those serious vascular injuries.2 
 4 neurologic deficits were present in more than a quarter of patients suffering from tcad.4 cases of traumatic quadruple lesions of the cervical arteries have exhibited pronounced neurologic deficits.5 
 6 the following case report describes tcad of all four cervical arteries after a high - energy horse - riding injury of a woman with no resulting neurologic deficit .
traumatic cervical artery dissection ( tcad ) represents a rare but under certain circumstances life - threatening injury . due to improvements in the diagnostic algorithms in the emergency room , blunt

  this is in agreement with a recent study by cothren and coworkers.17 the authors looked at the therapeutic options after blunt tcad and clearly demonstrated that the type of treatment , heparin versus antiplatelet agents , does not appear to significantly affect either the risk of stroke or the injury healing rates.17 we conclude from the experience with our case and the recent literature that anticoagulation in the presence of tcad is necessary but may be different from patients with chronic atherosclerosis .
