chlorhexidine gel showed the maximum antimicrobial activity against e. faecalis , whereas calcium hydroxide showed the least . among the natural intracanal medicaments , m. citrifolia gel consistently exhibited good inhibition up to the day 5 followed by aloe vera gel and papain gel .
group 1 : saline ( negative control ) group 2 : calcium hydroxide group 4 : m. citrifolia gel group 5 : aloe vera gel group 6 : 2% chlorhexidine gel calcium hydroxide ( sigma  aldrich , mumbai , india ) was mixed with sterile saline in a ratio of 1.5:1 ( wt / vol ) to obtain a paste - like consistency .
there is no study to comparatively evaluate the antimicrobial activity of natural extracts of m. citrifolia , papain , and aloe vera ( all in gel formulation ) , 2% chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide , against enterococcus faecalis .
hence , this study was undertaken to evaluate the disinfection of dentinal tubules when contaminated with e. faecalis using m. citrifolia gel , papain gel , and aloe vera when compared with calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine gel .
group 5 ( aloe vera gel ) showed comparable antibacterial activity to m. citrifolia gel on first day , but there was a gradual decrease in the efficacy by the end of day 5 . to summarize the results ,
