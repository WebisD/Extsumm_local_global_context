thus , the hydrogel prepared using cmc can be used to deliver theophylline in sustained manner and can be used effectively against nocturnal asthma ; cmc can also be useful for the delivery of drugs which are unstable in acidic ph .
from the results obtained , it may be concluded that the prepared hydrogels were ph - sensitive and the degree of swelling of hydrogel depends on the concentration of cross - linking agent as well as on the ph of the environment . as the theophylline is released highly in basic ph the peak theophylline concentration will be achieved at early morning which will be highly beneficial to the patients suffering from nocturnal asthma .
the in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the drug release is slowed down and prolonged which is better than commercial available formulation and hence better .
, an attempt was made to formulate a ph - sensitive hydrogel from cmc containing theophylline which has not been attempted so far and evaluate it in vitro and in vivo .
cmc since soluble in water , undergoes extensive swelling in basic ph compared to acidic ph and drug release is maximum in intestine , thus it can be highly helpful in controlling symptoms of nocturnal asthma .
