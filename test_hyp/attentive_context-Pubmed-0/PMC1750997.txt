in this issue of critical care , kao and colleagues   consider whether open lung biopsy ( olbx ) can assist in the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
olbx has been used for years as a method of defining the underlying pathology in patients with lung disease .
progress has been limited potentially due to the heterogeneous phenotypes that are known to underlie the american european consensus definition of this disease .
clinical outcome in ards remains poor despite substantial advances in our understanding of the biology of this syndrome .
a similar discussion has taken place in the interstitial lung disease arena , where some advocate the demonstration of usual interstitial pneumonitis among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , whereas others believe that a therapeutic trial of steroids in the majority of patients is justifiable until new therapeutic strategies emerge .
while its role has become established in the setting of interstitial lung disease , its utility and safety are more controversial in critically ill patients .
such biomarkers may help define the underlying pathobiology and so become a surrogate for olbx in assessing the steroid responsiveness of the disease .
proponents of olbx argue that knowledge of underlying etiology can be helpful in defining the best course of treatment .
