the purpose of this review was to evaluate the current literature on the role and importance of dietary protein and resistance training on the expression of the skeletal muscle isoforms of the myosin heavy chain .
the purpose of this review is to evaluate the current literature on the effects of dietary protein and resistance training on the expression of the myosin heavy chain ( mhc ) .
although the focus of this review is the effects of dietary protein and resistance training on mhc changes , it is necessary to establish the foundation of the particular role that resistance training and protein intake play on skeletal protein balance .
a combination of resistance training and proper diet elicits several physiological responses that enhance the structure and function of skeletal muscle .
the importance of the mhc can almost be quantified by its sheer size , accounting for 2530% of all muscle proteins
essentially , the mhc dictates how the muscle will react to an induced load , such as that of exercise .
this leads to increased strength and size of the contractile unit ( actin , myosin , troponin , and tropomyosin ) of muscle .
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy involves the growth of the sarcoplasm and non - contractile proteins ( -actinin , desmin , dystrophin , myomesins , nebulin , titin , and vinculin ) that do not directly contribute to muscular force production .
