this review will focus on this essential propriety of rpe and its impairment in dr .
a failure of any one of these functions can lead to degeneration of the retina , loss of visual function , and blindness .  
it has become clear , mainly from in vitro studies , that rpe cells play an important role in immune responses by the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) molecules , adhesion molecules , fasl and cytokines . with these different complex functions ,
diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) remains the leading cause of blindness among working - age individuals in developed countries . whereas proliferarive diabetic retinopathy ( pdr ) is the commonest sight - threatening lesion in type 1 diabetes , diabetic macular edema ( dme ) is the primary cause of poor visual acuity in type 2 diabetes .
neovascularization due to severe hypoxia is the hallmark of pdr whereas vascular leakage due to the breakdown of the blood retinal barrier ( brb ) is the main event involved in the pathogenesis of dme   .
the main functions of the rpe are the following : ( 1 ) transport of nutrients , ions , and water ( 2 ) absorption of light and protection against photooxidation , ( 3 ) reisomerization of all - trans - retinal into 11-cis - retinal , which is a key element of the visual cycle , ( 4 ) phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor membranes , and ( 5 ) secretion of various essential factors for the structural integrity of the retina .
