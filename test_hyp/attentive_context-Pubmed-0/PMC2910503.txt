the mechanism of innate and adaptive immunity induced by dsrna and the potential application of dsrna as a vaccine adjuvant against viral infection and anticancer immunotherapy is elaborated .
the primary cytokines involved in this response are type i ifns including ifn- and ifn- .         in this review ,
double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) , a virus replication intermediate and a signature of infection , is sensed by tlr3 , two members of rlrs family , that is , the rna helicases rig - i and melanoma differentiation - associated gene 5 ( mda-5 ) , and the nlr pyrin domain ( nlrp ) 3 protein of nlr family .
pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) of the host when recognizing pamps trigger a release of inflammatory cytokines and type i interferons ( ifns )   .
prrs are evolutionally conserved and have been investigated extensively . from the initial investigation of toll - like receptor ( tlr ) family   to the recent discoveries of retinoic acid - inducible gene - i ( rig - i)-like receptors ( rlrs )   and the nucleotide - binding domain and leucine - rich repeat containing gene family ( nlrs , also known as nod - like receptors )   , all the evidence point to an important role in host defense .
