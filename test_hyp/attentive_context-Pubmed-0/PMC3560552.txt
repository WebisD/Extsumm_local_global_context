taken together , our results and those of others , suggest that characterization of the specific receptor systems activated , and the pro - inflammatory factors regulated , by trail in vivo may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases as diverse as infection , autoimmunity , and allergy .
our study aimed to identify the role of strail in the pathophysiology of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and to explore whether allergen - specific subcutaneous immunotherapy treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis patients altered any observed effect of strail .
ige levels had a statistically significant difference between the values of the research group before and after allergen - specific subcutaneous immunotherapy .
as shown in figure 1 , significant difference was seen in the mean values of strail in allergic rhinitis patients before immunotherapy ( n=25 ; 939.85352.52 pg / ml ) , afterc immunotherapy ( n=25 ; 628.93170.5 pg / ml ) and healthy controls ( n=25 ; 612.64135.6 pg / ml ) .
as shown in table 3 , there was a statistically significant difference between the values of the research group before and after immunotherapy ( grasses mixture , barley mixture , oleaauropeae , d. pteronyssinus , d. farinae )
