the evidence from a large and growing body of literature related to the exposure to infectious agents , as measured by day - care attendance , and the risk of childhood leukaemia was systematically evaluated using a meta - analytic approach .
, we took a meta - analytic approach to summarize the findings to date on the relationship between day - care attendance and risk of childhood all .
the protective effect of early infection on risk of subsequent childhood all parallels the similarly protective impact of parasitic infections on type i diabetes in both animal models and children .
for example , in the evaluation of potential control selection bias , reduced risks were observed for the analyses excluding three studies that used hospital - based controls ( or = 0.78 , 95% ci : 0.68 , 0.90 ) and excluding two studies that used random digit dialing ( rdd ) to select controls ( or = 0.72 , 95% ci : 0.63 , 0.81 ) .
all the studies included in this analysis were conducted with the a priori objective of testing the biologically plausible ,  delayed infection hypothesis , which specifies a predicted direction of risk , timing of the exposure and the most applicable subtype of leukaemia .
