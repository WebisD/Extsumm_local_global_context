, the data reported here 
  represent the first functional characterization of the klf14 protein , outline 
  a novel pathway for the silencing of the tgfrii 
  promoter , provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which these 
  phenomena are achieved , and report additional tgf-inducible , klf 
  proteins that are good candidates to regulate this promoter .
therefore , understanding 
  how this down - regulation of the tgfrii promoter occurs 
  is of primary biological importance for better understanding tgf 
  signaling .
the current study provides us with several novel mechanistic insights on 
  the regulation of the tgf pathway . for instance
these findings 
  are of significant relevance to the areas of klf proteins , tgf 
  signaling , the maintenance of cell homeostasis , and their potential 
  contribution to disease states .
now , due to the findings 
  reported in the current study , we can propose a model wherein tgf 
  cytokines activate and repress the tgfrii promoter 
  using the very same gc - rich sites utilized by this family of proteins . 
 
interestingly , we 
  demonstrate that there is a strong inverse correlation between expression 
  patterns in a temporal manner of tgfrii mrna and klf14 mrna in human 
  pancreatic cancer cells .
