in a small cohort of cancer patients submitted to major surgery and admitted to the icu , initial urinary n - gal was a predictor of po aki . patients with elevated urinary n - gal also showed a trend toward higher hospital mortality .
neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( n - gal ) is a widely studied early biomarker of ischemia and kidney injury , which allows the identification of patients at a higher risk of kidney injury 48 h before traditional detection methods , thereby allowing the implementation of preventive / protective strategies before renal damage becomes irreversible . considering the negative impact of aki among oncology patients , this study intended to assess the efficacy of urinary n - gal as an early biomarker of aki immediately after major oncological surgeries in patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( icu ) .
this study showed that in the context of oncological surgery , the urinary n - gal level assessed at admission to the icu was a strong predictor of aki , and patients with higher values of n - gal showed a trend toward higher hospital mortality .
patients with lower levels of urinary n - gal had lower incidence of aki ( lower levels of serum urea and creatinine ) and shorter length of hospitalization in the icu . when patients with or without the development of aki were compared , the urinary n - gal levels were found to be a strong outcome predictor of aki incidence [ table 2 ] .
