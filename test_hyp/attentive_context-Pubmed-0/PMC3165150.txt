therefore , this study is focused on the genetic identification of staphylococcal exotoxins , sccmec types , and genetic relatedness by pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) of the sig isolates in korea .
therefore , sig , especially mrsig , may have significant clinical implications for companion animals with skin infections or chronic otitis that is of concern for veterinary staff , companion animal owners , and healthy companion animals .
s. pseudintermedius infections in humans , spread of mrsp populations , and association of sig with canine pyoderma and chronic otitis   has been previously reported .
analysis of the sig isolates ( n = 178 ) for ses and tsst 1 genes showed that only a single s. pseudintermedius isolate from a veterinary staff member ( h1 - 23 ) harbored the enterotoxin c ( sec ) gene ( fig .
although the siet gene was present in 93.3% of the sig isolates ( from 108 dogs and two cats ) in this study , only 14 dogs had a history of various skin disease including allergy and prolonged inflammation lesion in skin ( n = 13 ) or otitis ( n = 1 ) ( data not shown ) .
