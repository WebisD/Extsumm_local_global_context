the objective of the present study was to isolate and characterize proteins with protease inhibitory activity from white cloud beans .
the present study disclosed the production of two trypsin inhibitors with closely related n - terminal sequences chromatographic behavior and bioactivities by the white cloud bean variety of phaseolus vulgaris .  
the isolation of two trypsin inhibitors with very similar biochemical and biological characteristics from white cloud beans was achieved in the present investigation .  
this is reminiscent of the finding that lentil and vigna mungo inhibitors have little or no hiv-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory and antifungal activities   . in summary ,
the ic50 values of the inhibitory effects of the trypsin inhibitors on l1210 cells were , respectively , 21.5  m and 28.8  m ( table 4 ) .
the trypsin inhibitors demonstrate the same molecular mass ; both are adsorbed on deae - cellulose and unadsorbed on affi - gel blue gel but can be separated by ion exchange chromatography on sp - sepharose .  
they reportedly have a molecular mass of about 9  kda   or 13  kda , smaller than the value of 16  kda obtained for white cloud bean trypsin inhibitors .
they have approximately the same trypsin inhibitory potency , and neither of them inhibits hiv-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity , hiv-1 integrase inhibitory activity , sars coronavirus proteinase inhibitory activity , or fungal growth .
