importantly , we have identified two cell lines that displayed dichotomous properties with respect to their ability to support the kshv latency program and mapped these cytologic attributes to ( a ) differences in the state of virus - induced nf-b activation immediately following primary infection and upon establishment of latency , ( b ) expression of unique lana isoforms associated with lytic replication , and ( c ) susceptibility of persistently infected cells to viral impairment of key components of the endogenous anti - inflammatory response pathways .
together , our findings represent the first delineation of the important role that skin cells may play in kshv pathogenesis and reveal both the cellular correlates for maintenance of viral latency and the nature of interactions between kshv and the host anti - inflammatory axis that could serve as predictive markers for cutaneous ks .
in this study , we investigated the infectious process of kshv in skin - derived cells in order to identify pathogenetic themes that underlie the ability of kshv to induce cutaneous ks lesions in skin , a highly specialized site whose endogenous anti - inflammatory processes presumably fail to overcome this pathologic outcome . using primary melanocytes as well as established melanoma - derived cells , we examined key markers of virus / host interactions that control kshv tropism and pathogenesis in skin and identified important correlates that link the replicative program of kshv with the underlying inflammatory status of infected cells . specifically , we identified two cell lines  mewo and mel1700that consistently displayed differences in ( a ) susceptibility to productive infection , ( b ) timing and robustness of virus replication , ( c ) expression of kshv latency - associated nuclear antigen , lana , ( d ) replication phase - specific expression of viral genes , and ( e ) susceptibility to virus - induced perturbation of the anti - inflammatory melanogenic response
