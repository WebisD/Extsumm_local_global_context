the process of odontogenesis is under the control of homeobox ( hox ) genes ; a number of different mesenchymal regulatory molecules and their receptors .
pax9 is a transcription factor required for tooth morphogenesis and plays a role in the establishment of the inductive capacity of the tooth mesenchyme as it is necessary for the mesenchymal expression of bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp4 ) , msx1 and lef1 genes .
the etiology of dental anomalies is partly environmental and partly genetic . because of the polygenic nature of dental characteristics
, it is very challenging to identify one single defective gene responsible for a specific dental anomaly .
msx1 and msx2 genes are responsible for the developmental position and further development of tooth buds , respectively .
further studies are required and the rapid progress in the field of genetics may help the clinicians to more accurately discern the environmental and genetic factors contributing to the development of dental anomalies . currently , the orthodontist , probably the first to diagnose hereditary dental anomalies and malocclusion of an individual , will remain responsible for the detection of any additional defects in the same patient in order to provide the best treatment .
