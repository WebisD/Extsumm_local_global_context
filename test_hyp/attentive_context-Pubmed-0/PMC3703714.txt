in addition to air temperature and humidity , air velocity , and long - wave thermal radiation , it was found that short - wave solar radiation and heat conduction are among the influential factors which affect the thermal sensation vote and thermal comfort vote of the human body in a winter outdoor thermal environment .
an experiment on test subjects was performed to clarify the effect that the thermal environment stimuli in a winter outdoor space have on the human body , and the relationship between outdoor environmental factors and the psychological response of the human body was demonstrated .
the validity of using a thermal environment evaluation index that incorporates these environmental factors for an outdoor space was demonstrated .
accordingly , this research shows the relationship between the outdoor thermal environmental evaluation index for winter and the psychological response of the human body by using etfe to temperature - convert the effect of air temperature and air velocity , long - wave thermal radiation in outdoor space , short - wave solar radiation , contact member 's surface temperature , and humidity and arrange them on the same evaluation axis .
given that the psychological quantity for the human body in an outdoor environment differed from the case of an indoor environment and the results showed a lot of noise and dispersion , investigations were carried out with a significance probability of 25% . as a result of t - testing the components of etfe , it was found that the thermal sensation vote for outdoors in winter is strongly influenced by and varies according to air temperature ta , long - wave thermal radiation erfhtal , and short - wave solar radiation erfhtas .
