the aim of this systematic review was to identify specific evidence - based research answering questions to address the potential of robotic technologies to monitor older individuals ' health and wellbeing and to assist with activities of daily living .
another aim was to review the extent of robotic technologies currently tested and used in the home environment for older individuals .
this systematic review has highlighted that robotics is still an emerging field in terms of its application to health and rehabilitation for community dwelling older people . despite these studies being of a lower design quality , the evidence to date shows that robotics research is used widely in engineering laboratories and , to a lesser extent , in clinical settings .
we identified two key questions for the systematic review of the literature addressing robotics and ageing in the home environment .
future robot design needs to consider development from a different perspective , considering not only assisted mobility , but also interfacing artificial intelligence for interaction with older individuals , to monitor their health , provide medication prompts , encourage exercise , and provide them with confidence to maintain independent living .
the yield of articles in response to question 1 showed that robotic technology is currently available to assist older people and people with physical disabilities .
