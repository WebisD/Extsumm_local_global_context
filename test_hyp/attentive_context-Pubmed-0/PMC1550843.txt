hopefully , my geocentrism in this review in an international medium can be understood and pardoned in light of that fact .
the history of disaster communications before computers or the internet ( or outside the realm of the internet ) provides us with a long - standing testament to this sad fact .
this has been an extremely truncated history of disaster communications outside the world of computers and internet .
acknowledging some of the earlier aspects of disaster or emergency communications can be interesting and engaging , and it can enable us to understand the fundamental need to communicate about emergent events .
although much of this review is oriented to history in the usa , there were parallel activities occurring in all countries in which the new technology of radio existed .
there is a huge body of information , to some portions of which i undoubtedly owe apologies for lack of mention . in all the history of disaster and emergency communications , from the bleak beginnings to the 21st century , we can see how the combination of great potential with lack of planning and preparedness has caused fiasco after fiasco .
the modern ability to chat casually or to be entertained by communication technology is but an offshoot of the development of that technology which first permitted priority communication about more urgent matters .
