in conclusion , the present study demonstrated for the first time that lhpp rs35936514 ct / tt genotype may affect regional brain activity in mdd patients .
this suggests that the influence of lhpp variation may be one mechanism that contributes to the neural circuits of mdd .
based on the large number of samples studied on lhpp rs35936514 associated with mdd in chinese subjects , it was here noted that lhpp was associated with thyroid disorders , which may affect depression .
, the association of lhpp rs35936514 with the resting - state brain activity was measured using alff .
furthermore , expression of multiple genes involved in mdd , and their interaction with the lhpp genotype could make a change in the neural circuits of mdd patients .
subjects were further divided into two groups : a cc group homozygous for the c allele ( 23 mdd , 57 hc ; mean age = 34.06  14.45 years , 60% female ) and risk t - carrier group ( ct / tt genotypes ; = 22 mdd , 58 hc ; mean age = 30.02  13.57 years , 61% female ) .
it was higher among t - carriers of the lhpp rs35936514 polymorphism in both the hc and mdd groups than in cc individuals within the respective diagnostic groups .
