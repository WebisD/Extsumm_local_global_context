the aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 4% articaine hydrochloride and 2% lignocaine hydrochloride for the orthodontic extraction .
the study was carried out on 50 patients at outpatient department of oral and maxillofacial surgery who needed bilateral maxillary premolar extractions for orthodontic purpose .
pain rating showed that there was no significant difference in pain score in articaine palatal and buccal group ( p > 0.8892 ) , whereas a significant difference was noted in lignocaine palatal and buccal group ( tables 3 and 4 ) .
patients included in this study were in the age group of 15 - 25 years , both genders and systemically healthy .
certain added advantages like shorter time of onset , longer duration of action and greater diffusion property makes it an ideal anesthetic agent to be used in dentistry .
experimental sites ( group 1 ) were injected with 0.5 - 1 ml of 4% articaine hcl containing 1:100000 adrenaline , incrementally in the buccal vestibule .
the mean onset time of lignocaine anesthesia was 1.337  0.2369 , whereas in articaine group the mean time was 1.012  0.2058 min .
this indicates that onset time of articaine was significantly less than lidocaine ( p < 0.0005 ) ( table 2 ) .
