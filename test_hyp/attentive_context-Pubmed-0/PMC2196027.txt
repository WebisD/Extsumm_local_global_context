involvement of the p2z / p2x7 purinergic receptor in   lps - dependent il-1 release may allow the development   of new pharmacological antagonists ( i.e. , oatp and derivatives ) to modulate the in vivo production of this cytokine   in pathological conditions such as septic shock or chronic   inflammatory diseases .
3 b. it has been shown previously   that atp is a powerful stimulus for il-1 secretion from   macrophages ( 10 , 11 ) , thus suggesting that this nucleotide   might also have a role in autocrine / paracrine stimulation of   these cells . in support of this hypothesis ,
we   show that il-1 release is restored in lps - treated , oatpinhibited cells by the k ionophore nigericin , an agent   known to cause il-1 release through a receptor - independent pathway ( 4 , 10 ) .
however , this   is not unexpected because adp , in contrast with atp , is   devoid of cytotoxic activity , and data from our laboratory   show that release of il-1 is optimal in response to a submaximal , noncytotoxic stimulation of the p2z / p2x7 receptor , such as that due to adpe ( d. ferrari and f. di virgilio , manuscript in preparation ) .
