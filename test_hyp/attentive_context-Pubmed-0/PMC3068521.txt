, we present a patient with denys  drash syndrome , in whom the calcineurin inhibitors were found to induce total remission .
nephrotic syndrome in the first year of life in two thirds of cases is caused by mutations in four genes ( nphs1 , nphs2 , wt1 , and lamb2 ) .
we report the benefits of csa treatment of the patient with glomerulopathy associated with wt1 mutation as seen in denys  drash syndrome .
however , the therapeutic effect of csa in genetic nephrotic syndrome is probably related to a direct influence of csa on podocytes .   in this report
our patient is the first child of non - consanguineous young parents ( mother 32 , father 34  years ) without any past medical history of kidney diseases .
the fact that the antiproteinuric effect of csa results from a direct effect on podocytes explains not only its beneficial role in most steroid - resistant and steroid - dependent nephrotic syndromes but also the fact of cyclosporine dependency .
the girl in this report had early - onset srns secondary to dms , what was confirmed in kidney biopsy .
the wilms tumor suppressor gene 1 ( wt1 ) encodes a transcription factor involved in kidney and gonadal development .
