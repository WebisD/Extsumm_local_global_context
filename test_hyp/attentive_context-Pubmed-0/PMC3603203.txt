the mixed bacterial consortium successful in laboratory studies may fail in the real field because of their sensitivity to high concentrations of other compounds .
the high incidence of atrazine to contaminate water resources and the increasing concern about the toxicological properties of atrazine has made researches directed toward bioremediation of atrazine in polluted sites . therefore , the main objectives of this research are evaluating the effects of carbon and nitrogen sources on atrazine biodegradation using mixed bacterial consortium isolated from corn field soil located in south of shiraz ( kavar ) and determining the efficiency of atrazine biodegradation process in soil culture .
kavar corn field soil with a long history of atrazine application in fars province of iran has been explored for their potential of atrazine biodegradation .
however , for inoculated soil samples , degradation rate was higher and its reductions were 19.572% . the inoculated soil samples at 25% soil moisture at initial concentration of 1.3 , 6.7 , and 20  mg  g soil , atrazine reductions were 69.5% , 60.5% and 30.5% within 30 days of incubation , respectively .  
carbon sources of sodium citrate and sucrose had the highest atrazine biodegradation rate . according to data ,
