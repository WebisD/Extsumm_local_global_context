we planned to measure the electrolyte concentrations ( total sodium and ionized potassium ) in serum and urine samples using both ral ion3 sp flame photometer and beckman coulter synchron cx9 pro electrolyte analyzer and performed an agreement analysis between the two measurements .
the aim of our study was to do an agreement analysis of two different laboratory methods used to measure electrolytes i.e. , between the conventional flame photometer and the automated ion selective electrode method in serum and urine samples .
good degree of agreement is seen on comparing the ion selective electrode method and the conventional flame photometer for measuring the electrolytes , namely sodium and potassium , for serum samples and also for the electrolytes measurement in urine samples .
was seen on comparing the two methods , since they do not differ enough to cause problems in clinical interpretation ; the use of synchron cx9 in place of flame photometer for electrolyte analysis in serum and urine is justified or use the two interchangeably .
ion selective electrode ( synchron cx9 pro ) equipment take a shorter analytic time , high throughput ( larger volume of the test ) compared to the semi automated flame photometric method . a good degree of agreement of results
