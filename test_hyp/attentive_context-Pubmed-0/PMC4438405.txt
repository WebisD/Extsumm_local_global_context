we present this case to highlight the consideration of moyamoya as a cause of hypertensive renal failure .
we report a case of neurological disease , moyamoya , causing hypertension , leading to partially reversible kidney failure .
however , the long - term management of ckd with aggressive bp control induced transient ischemia because of moyamoya .
severe hypertension in pediatric patients is thought to be secondary and often related to renovascular disease . for this reason ,
recognition of moyamoya led to surgical revascularization and has changed our medical management to accept higher blood pressures up to the 90th percentile .
, this case highlights that moyamoya must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with hypertensive emergency and renal failure . although ckd is a major risk factor of hypertensive emergencies with reports indicating that 79% of adult patients have ckd stage 2 or greater , there are a number of causes that must be considered ( table  1 ) .
hypertensive urgency is defined as the presence of severe hypertension with no acute end - organ damage .
moyamoya. although pediatric moyamoya has been associated with severe hypertension   , we believe that this case is the first to present as a hypertensive emergency with renal failure and highlights this disease for consideration in the differential diagnosis of hypertensive renal failure ( table  1 ) .
