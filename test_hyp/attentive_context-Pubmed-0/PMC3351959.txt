in this study we analyzed different modes of extracorporeal elimination techniques for reducing sflc kappa in patients with kappa light chain mm associated nephropathy requiring dialysis .
we analyzed the efficacy of the protein leaking membrane hco1100 to eliminate sflc in kappa light chain mm patients with acute renal failure necessitating rrt .
the elimination capacity of the hco1100 was studied in the hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration mode and was compared to standard hemodialysis procedures as well as to plasma exchange .
we compared a novel type of hemofilter , a so - called protein leaking membrane , applied in a hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration mode to standard procedures such as high flux hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration as well as plasma exchange .
studies were initiated to investigate the use of plasma exchange in patients with mm and acute renal failure but failed to show any significant benefit on renal function . in the present manuscript we report on a new type of renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) , namely rrt using a protein leaking membrane .
multiple myeloma ( mm ) is a b - cell neoplasia which is characterized by an malignant proliferation of aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow .
