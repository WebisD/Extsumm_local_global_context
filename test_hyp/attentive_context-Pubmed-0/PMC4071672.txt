the patient was a 29-year - old woman and spouse with heterozygous genotype ( as ) .
couples at risk for the transmission of genetic diseases can now choose ivf and pgd to avoid the problem of selective abortion that is associated with pre - natal diagnosis during pregnancy .
the advent of ivf as a treatment for infertility has created the opportunity to study the chromosomal constitution of surplus human pre - implantation embryos .
the most common form of pgd involves the extraction of one or two cells from the pre - implantation embryo , often around the 8-cell stage .
rapid dna analysis methods have become available , and these techniques are now widely used for prenatal diagnosis.910111213 pre - implantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) is a procedure that has emerged against the backdrop of in vitro fertilisation ( ivf ) technology . in nigeria , this process of ivf was first introduced by ashiru et al.14 following their pioneering work , we were able to advance this technique for patients with infertility,1516 and now for patients with advanced maternal age and sickle cell disorders with the use of pgd .
our results demonstrate that pgd for the detection of sickle cell anaemia is a powerful diagnostic tool for carrier couples who desire a healthy child but wish to avoid the difficult decision of whether to abort an affected foetus .
