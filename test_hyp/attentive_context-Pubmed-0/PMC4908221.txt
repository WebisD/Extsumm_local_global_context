we report a case of a pathological fracture of the lunate revealing an intraosseous ganglion cyst .
detecting a single radiolucent lesion in the lunate accompanied by pain is rare , and detecting a pathological fracture of the lunate revealing an intraosseous ganglion cyst is exceptional . isolated rare cases of intraosseous ganglion cysts in the carpal bones have been reported , most commonly in the lunate and the scaphoid.5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 their etiology remains largely unknown ; however trauma , herniation of the joint capsule , mucoid degeneration , intramedullary metaplasia of mesenchymal cells , and congenital rests of synovial producing cells have been suggested to play a part .
intraosseous ganglion cyst ( igc ) is a benign , no neoplastic bone lesion with histological similarity to the soft tissue ganglion cyst.1 , 2 intraosseous ganglion contains mucoid viscous material with no epithelial or synovial lining .
a 42-year - old female , with a history of right distal radius fracture , presented with right wrist pain following a fall on the palm of the right hand .
the radiolucent carpal lesions are usually symptom - free found incidentally on radiographs of the wrist performed for other reasons .
