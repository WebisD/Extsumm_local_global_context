we have studied the tyrosine - tyrosinase reaction in terms of melanin formation and ros scavenging ability of melanin . in a battery of studies
, we found radical formation through the enzyme reaction , and discuss the formation mechanism in this paper .
if o2 and h2o2 are involved in a downstream of the generation process of h and oh , esr signals of dmpo - h and dmpo - oh generated by the tyrosine - tyrosinase reaction were analyzed in the presence of sod , a scavenger for o2 , and catalase , a cleaving enzyme for h2o2 .
oh  +  h or h  +  e  h. on the other hand , the amount of dmpo - oh was not affected by the replacement of h2o to d2o , suggesting that oh was derived from the catalytic reaction of tyrosine to dopaquinone by tyrosinase . since catalase had no effect on the generation of two radicals as described above , fenton - like reaction in which h2o2 reacts with transient metal copper in the structures of tyrosinase and its intermediates
since there are many cosmetics developed for whitening ability by inhibiting tyrosine - tyrosinase reaction , our study revealed that they also might contribute to alleviate the oxidative damage of the skin by inhibiting oh generation via the enzyme reaction .
