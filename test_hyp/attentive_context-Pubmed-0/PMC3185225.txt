the biological data expressed as anti - leukemia p388 activity and parameter describing ability to physicochemical ( noncovalent ) interaction with dna as value of dna - duplexes stabilization were applied in this study .
it has been found that hydrophobic and total molecular symmetry properties are important for antitumor activity of acridinone derivatives , and electronic and topological properties are important for physicochemical ( noncovalent ) dna - duplexes stabilization of these compounds .
statistically significant equations describing structure  antitumor activity relationships and structure  ability to physicochemical ( noncovalent ) interaction with dna relationships in acridinone derivatives group were derived .
multiple regression analysis was used to model relationships between molecular structural descriptors and biological ( antitumor ) activity of molecules , or between molecular structural descriptors and physicochemical interaction of acridinone derivatives with dna .
physicochemical interactions of acridinones with dna were evaluated in view of quantitative structure  activity relationships ( qsar ) .
gats7e combined with i , h-047 , and mp descriptors . in the case of qsar model for ils as dependent - variable values , 14 were obtained for only g3 m , g3 m combined with logp , g3 m combined with logp and g2p , and g3 m combined with logp , g2p and g3p descriptors values of experimental and calculated data for dna - duplexes stabilization and antitumor activity of acridinones the increase in dna melting temperature ( expressed in centigrade degrees ) at drug to dna base pairs 0.25  m ratio difference between experimental and calculated values the percentage of increase in survival time of treated to control mice with p388 leukemia at optimal dose correlation between the experimental data and the calculated data from the derived multiple regression qsar equation for a dna - duplexes stabilization of acridinones expressed as tm ( the increase in dna melting temperature at drug to dna base pairs 0.25  m ratio ) and b antitumor activity of acridinones expressed as ils ( survival time of treated to control mice with p388 leukemia at optimal dose ) values of the cross - validated root - mean - square error rmsecv test 14 represents rmsecv test performed only for one , combined two and three , and for all the four significance descriptors in qsar models , respectively . in the case of qsar model , for tm as dependent - variable values , 14 were obtained for only gats7e , gats7e combined with i , gats7e combined with i and h-047 , gats7e combined with i , h-047 , and mp descriptors . in the case of qsar model for ils as dependent - variable values , 14 were obtained for only g3 m , g3 m combined with logp , g3 m combined with logp and g2p , and g3 m combined with logp , g2p and g3p descriptors
