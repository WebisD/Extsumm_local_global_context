we have taken advantage of this unusual feature to characterize the dinoflagellate plastid transcriptome , and find that our analysis fully supports a highly reduced plastid genome for the peridinin - containing dinoflagellates . furthermore ,
one method potentially applicable to the characterization of the plastid genome is to determine the spectrum of genes expressed , as gene expression should be independent from the form in which the genes are found .
as it seems likely that polyuridylylation may be common in dinoflagellate plastids , it may be possible to rapidly characterize the transcriptome of many different species using the method described here .
we have found that , unlike other transcripts in the dinoflagellates , those encoded by known minicircle genes carry a homogenous polyuridine tract at their 3 termini .
thus the mechanism and function of the dinoflagellate plastid transcript 3 end modification are as unique as their form ii rubisco ( 10 ) and peridinin  chlorophyll a - protein ( 9 ) . the major challenge for plastid phylogeny underscored by our results is to reconcile the many unique features of the dinoflagellate plastids with their phylogenetic relationships to red algae . in addition , given the concurrence of several lines of evidence supporting the highly reduced nature of the dinoflagellate plastid genome , it will be of interest to reinvestigate the nature of the selective forces maintaining the current plastid genome size in higher plants .
