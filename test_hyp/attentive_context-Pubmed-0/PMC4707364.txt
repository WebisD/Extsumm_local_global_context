we aimed to evaluate the relationship of prenatal tdf use and growth outcomes among heu infants born to mothers who used combination art for pmtct or hiv treatment during pregnancy in kenya .
in this study of heu infants in kenya , we found marginal differences in weight and waz between infants attending 6-week visits born to mothers with and without tdf use during pregnancy .
after adjustment for sociodemographic and medical characteristics , prenatal tdf use was associated with a trend for modest decrease in weight or waz .
given the increasing use of tdf for hiv treatment and biomedical prevention strategies in sub - saharan africa , further evaluation on postnatal effects of prenatal tdf use in this setting is crucial . while data on prep use in pregnancy accumulates , current data available from heu infants born to mothers on tdf - containing art regimens may potentially contribute to the growing safety profile of prolonged maternal prenatal tdf use on infant growth outcomes .
data from hiv - exposed uninfected ( heu ) infants could be particularly useful when assessing safety of prenatal tdf use for prep .
forthcoming international growth standards for weight , length , and head circumference by gestational age and sex developed by the intergrowth-21st project may be particularly useful for evaluating postnatal growth in settings with high prevalence of birth 37 weeks of gestation in africa .
