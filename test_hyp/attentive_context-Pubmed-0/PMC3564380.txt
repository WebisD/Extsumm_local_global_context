cd47 ( originally named integrin - associated protein ( iap ) ) is a cell surface protein of the immunoglobulin ( ig ) superfamily , which is heavily glycosylated and expressed by virtually all cells in the body .
the ability of cd47 to inhibit phagocytosis is clearly an important mechanism whereby innate cells as macrophages or dendritic cells can discriminate between self and non - self , and maintain tolerance to host cells . in the field of xenotransplantation , further development and research to create xenotransplants carrying human cd47 may prove important to obtain even better conditions where xenogenic cell , tissues , or organs can be tolerated when transplanted into humans . in the field of cancer research , where tumor cells may express higher levels of cd47 as a way of avoiding phagocytosis and clearance by phagocytic cells , and where cd47-blocking antibodies have been shown to promote clearance of and to reduce the dissemination of tumor cells , brings hope that careful development of reagents that can block the cd47/sirp interaction may indeed be useful to treat many forms of cancer without having too much of a negative side effect in terms of inducing clearance of host cells .
