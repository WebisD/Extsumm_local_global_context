we reviewed the clinical outcomes on our single institution experience treating localized prostate cancer with high - dose - rate brachytherapy boost ( hdr - b ) , and ebrt to identify predictors of distant metastases .
in men treated with hdr - b and ebrt , gs is a significant factor on multivariate analysis for developing distant metastasis .
kaplan meier actuarial survival curve for psa progression free probability stratified by risk groups patient characteristics grouped by distant metastasis dm  distant metastases , bed  biologically equivalent dose psa failure ( phoenix definition ) developed in 7% of men with a median time to failure of 3.8 years ( range : 1.0 - 9.8 years ) . by nccn risk group psa failure developed in 3% , 5% , and 14% of men with low , intermediate , and high risk disease ( table 2 ) .
an institutional review board approved retrospective study that was performed on men with clinically localized biopsy - proven prostate cancer who were treated between 1991 and 2002 at a single center with hdr - b , and ebrt with at least one year of follow - up .
the mean ebrt dose was 37.5 gy ( range : 30.6 - 45 gy ) and hdr - b dose 22 gy for 15% , and 24 gy for 85% of patients .
