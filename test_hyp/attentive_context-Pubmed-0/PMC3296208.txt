the concentrations of the elements in the seaweeds were determined using synchrotron radiation total reflection x - ray fluorescence analysis ( srtxrf ) .
the results indicate a relationship among the metals present in the seaweeds and the rocks present in this area . besides
, the concentrations of common macro- and microelements obtained are comparable to those obtained by other authors using different analytical methods . however , multielement capability in a single analysis , high - sensitivity and precision , short analysis time , and easy sample preparation are some advantages of srtxrf when compared to other elemental determination techniques such as aas or icp - ms .
  the srtxrf technique proved to be adequate for the determination of 20 chemical elements present in eleven species of common macroalgae of fernando de noronha archipelago providing baseline information for the accumulation of metals in two sites .
also , the p. gymnospora had large amounts of zn ( 274.44  ppm ) whereas five algae species had levels of zn in the range of 27  ppm also , sr was found in all rocks analyzed ( ca .
as in the algae in these previous studies , the algae of fernando de noronha were found to contain large amounts of ca , k , and fe ( in parts per thousand , ppt ) and small or trace amounts of as , ba , co , cr , cs , cu , pb , rb , and zn . since data on the composition of the surfaces where algae in these previous studies grew was not reported , it is not possible to ascertain the contributions of these surface substrates to the composition of the algae .
