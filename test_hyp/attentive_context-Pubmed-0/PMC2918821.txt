we report a case of acute myeloid leukaemia revealed by a ms of the uterine cervix in a 48-year - old woman , 17 months after receiving a total dose of 100 mci i for papillary thyroid cancer .
aml is an uncommon complication of exposure to i , occurring mostly after a cumulative dose higher than 800 mci   . although cases of patients developing leukaemia after low - dose radioactive iodine are reported , the link with the treatment is still a matter of debate .
ms occurs mainly in patients with known acute myeloid leukaemia ( aml ) , myeloproliferative disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome   . in few cases
myeloid sarcoma ( ms ) are solid tumours composed of immature myeloid cells involving an extramedullary site .
unusual presentations , such as chloroma of the uterine cervix , may reveal myeloid malignancy and should therefore be kept in mind .
as the incidence of leukaemia after low - dose radioiodine therapy is unclear , a strict hematological follow - up of patients treated with any dose of i therapy is recommended to accurately detect any hematological complication which might have been underestimated .
a 48-year - old woman , gravida 3 , para 3 , was referred to our unit in april 2007 for a large uterine cervical mass detected during an intrauterine device change .
