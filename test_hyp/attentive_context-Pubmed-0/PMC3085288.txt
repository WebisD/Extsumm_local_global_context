the most important finding is the excellent response rate with a substantial proportion of complete responses and prolonged ttp and os for patients positive for egfr gene - activating mutations . for many years , the maximal expectation of a patient with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer was a partial remission of relatively short duration in the range of 5 to 9 months . with intermittent treatment ,
this brief report presents a single - institution experience on intermittent chemotherapy and tki in a small series of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung .
to the surprise and deep disappointment of all involved in the treatment of lung cancer , several large trials did not demonstrate any benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) as an addition to chemotherapy   .
while the number of patients in our trial is small and any definitive conclusion would be premature , we nevertheless believe that further research of intermittent therapy for patients positive for egfr gene - activating mutations is warranted . a randomised trial comparing first - line tki as monotherapy to the intermittent schedule should clarify the real value of this new approach .
.05 ) correlation was seen between the presence of activating egfr mutations and response . among the 8 patients who were positive for egfr gene - activating mutations , 4 complete and
