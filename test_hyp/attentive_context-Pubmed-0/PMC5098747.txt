it has been established that crew members participating in such terrestrial missions also shed latent herpesviruses.41 similarly , better controlled laboratory simulations of spaceflight confinement , such as a recent russian 500-day mars simulation , have also been found to re - create immune dysregulation , which shares some aspects of flight - associated dysregulation.42 we suggest monitoring strategies and countermeasures developed to assess and prevent incidence in astronauts may facilitate the reduction of illness on earth .
however , to perform the survey , it was necessary to replace the actual confirmed incidence with reported symptomatology , as in - flight crews rarely have the ability to confirm diagnoses , and treatment is usually based on presentation of symptoms .
for example , it is well understood that stress adversely affects immunity , which may increase susceptibility to disease.27 aged individuals are known to present with increased infectious disease or latent viral reactivation , which may be related to immune senescence with decreased t - cell function.39 also , terrestrial  space analog  conditions exist ; locations where remote deployment , prolonged isolation , and extreme environment recreate some of the stress effects of spaceflight.40 examples include undersea deployment or antarctica winter - over missions .
