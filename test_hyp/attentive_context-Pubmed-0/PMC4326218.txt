our data and previous data from the literature indicate that those functions are strictly interlinked and that deregulation of them might lead to cancer transformation , especially in cancers such as atc that possess an undifferentiated nature suggestive of cancer stem cell enrichment .
the analysis pointed to dicer1 , eif2c2 , rnasen , tp53 , cox8a , and ccnd1 genes , suggesting that stemness , microrna biogenesis and functions , p53 regulatory network , cyclin d1 , and cell cycle control , together with mitochondrial activity , might be coregulated as a whole in their functions .
the sw1736 atc cell line was used to investigate functional sox2 interactors isolated by a novel bioinformatics analysis . because sox2 seems to have a central role in the maintenance of stem features in the sw1736 atc cell line , the interactors are likely to play a role in stemness regulation .
cerna analysis made it possible to isolate several genes and functional networks related to cancer development , ageing , and homeostasis   .
the cerna bioinformatics analysis pointed to a list of genes that could be functionally coregulated with the stem transcriptional factor sox2 by a crosstalk mediated by several mirnas . in our analysis , we used interactions reported in the literature instead of bioinformatically predicted ones as done in the past   .
