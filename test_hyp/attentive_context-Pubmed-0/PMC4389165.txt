we present a case of concurrent anti - gbm disease and membranous nephropathy , which was resistant to conventional therapy , yet treated successfully with rituximab .
lastly , given the positive outcomes of this case and the pathobiology of anti - gbm disease , we suggest b - cell depletion therapy as an alternative treatment modality in refractory anti - gbm disease .
however , because of the infrequent nature of anti - gbm disease , there is a paucity of randomized clinical trial data with which to inform and optimize therapy .
goodpasture syndrome ( gps ) was first identified in 1959 by drs stanton and tange , with the description of nine patients with renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage , all of whom eventually died .
nonetheless , a small , randomized trial in 1985 of 17 subjects revealed the superiority of immunosuppressive therapy in combination with plasma exchange versus immunosuppression alone .
our patient experienced a rapidly progressive course typical of anti - gbm disease eventuating in hemodialysis .
left untreated , gps carries a poor prognosis . conventional treatment for anti - glomerular basement membrane
we contend that rituximab has induced a coincident and complete remission of his two separate glomerulopathies .
