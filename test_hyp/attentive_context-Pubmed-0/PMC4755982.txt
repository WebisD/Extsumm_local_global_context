so the present study evaluated the effect 
 of wearing tight pants on the trunk flexion and pelvic tilting angles in stand - to - sit 
 movement and in a seated posture .
trousers that are too tight can squeeze a sensory nerve under the 
 hip bone , causing a tingling , burning sensation called paresthesia1 , 4 , 5 . with this as the background , the present study aimed to understand 
 the hazards of the habit of wearing tightly fitting clothes in relation to deformations of 
 the musculoskeletal system and the movement of the lumbar spine and pelvis for the purpose 
 of providing basic data regarding proper habits in wearing clothes for the prevention of 
 pain in the musculoskeletal systems2 , 3 .
the change of the trunk flexion angle 
 ( 19.3 5.4 ) during the stand - to - sit movement when wearing the tight pants increased 
 significantly compared with that when wearing the general pants ( 12.0 3.8 ) ( p<0.05 ) . 
 the change in the posterior pelvic tilting angle ( 13.3 3.2 ) in the seated posture when 
 wearing the tight pants increased significantly compared with that when wearing of the 
 general pants ( 10.3 2.9 ) ( p<0.05 ) .
