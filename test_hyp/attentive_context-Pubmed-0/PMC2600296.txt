newport mdr - ampc isolates have been the source of sporadic cases and small outbreaks in humans in france during 20002005 .
these results support clonal expansion of 1 newport strain ( or a limited number of genetically related newport strains ) able to acquire and maintain a large inca / c2 mdr plasmid .
we can reasonably hypothesize that during 20002005 some isolates likely entered france from north america through imported food .
their plasmids carrying blacmy-2 were homogeneous ( same incompatibility group a / c2 , a main restriction type r1 , and a main hybridization type h1 ) .
from 2000 through 2005 , the french national reference centre for salmonella at the institut pasteur in paris reported 829 newport isolates among 69,759 salmonella clinical isolates . during this period and depending on the year
in contrast to europe , newport mdr - ampc has been frequently seen in the united states during the past decade .
all isolates had the same mlst type , st45 , and highly similar xbai - pfge profiles .
antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing was performed on 585 human newport isolates and 342 nonhuman newport isolates by disk diffusion with 32 antimicrobial drugs ( additional information available from fxweill@pasteur.fr ) .
