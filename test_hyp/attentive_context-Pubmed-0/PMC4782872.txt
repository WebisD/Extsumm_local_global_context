multivariate analysis showed that men ( adjusted hr 0.42 , 95% ci 0.390.46 ) and cci scores of 2 and higher ( adjusted hr 0.74 , 95% ci 0.610.90 ) were significantly associated with a lower risk of migraine .
by contrast , the results showed that patients aged 2044 years and those with more than 30 annual opd visits had an increased risk of migraine ( adjusted hr 1.52 , 95% ci 1.271.83 ; adjusted hr 2.57 , 95% ci 2.352.81 , respectively ) .
in this large nationwide cohort study , after adjusting for sex , age , the cci score , medications used , and annual opd visits , we observed that adult patients with asthma were 1.45-fold more likely to develop migraine than those without asthma .
the mean ages of the asthma and nonasthma groups were 51.4 ( sd  =  19.6 ) and 51.1 ( sd  =  19.6 ) years , respectively . a higher cci score was found in the asthma group than in the nonasthma group ( 0.38     0.94 vs 0.23     0.77 ) .
the adjusted hrs of migraine were 1.30 ( 95% ci 1.121.51 ) among the 20 to 44-year - olds and 1.28 ( 95% ci 1.141.44 ) among the 45-year - olds . in study participants with a cci score of 0 , patients with asthma had a higher risk of migraine than that of the patients without asthma ( adjusted hr 1.29 , 95% ci 1.171.42 ) ( table 3 ) .
