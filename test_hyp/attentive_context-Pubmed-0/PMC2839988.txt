if she is demonstrated to be at risk , the preventive / treatment modalities she needs are a consequence of which subgroup of the inherited breast cancers she is at risk with . in most european countries , it is the understanding to discuss health care as what is to be offered to any woman who needs it .
, the biological function of the different genes is known , and to some extent the ways breast cancers are produced when this function is lacking , have been described .

the cancers associated with different genetic syndromes occur at different ages , they may differ with respect to tumour characteristics , they have different prognosis , and they respond differently to prophylactic and treatment modalities . following the clinical genetic work - up to provide health care to a woman possibly at risk for inherited breast cancer , there is a multistep approach .
it is also about tradition and culture - what is possible in the current socio - ethical context .
the first detailed scientific description of inherited breast - ovarian cancer was given by paul broca in 1866 .
