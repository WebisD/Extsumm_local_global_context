both the langmuir and freundlich models fit equilibrium data well implying the existence of a monolayer adsorption and a heterogeneous surface existence in na - zeolite p1 , showing a strong adsorption capacity for ( co , cu , fe , and cd ) ions reaching a maximum capacity for cd .
the alkaline treatment of very cheap local pumice leads to the formation of na - zeolite p1 which has the high degree of crystallinity , the ph is higher than the phpzc , and the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged , favoring the adsorption of cationic species ( co , cu , fe , and cd ) .
the adsorption kinetics study of the heavy metals followed a pseudo - second - order model .
results found showed that the modified zeolite shows a good potential as adsorbent for ( co , cu , fe , and cd ) ions .
heavy metal ions uptake is the result of a combination of several interfacial reactions , namely , ion exchange , chemisorption , and adsorption as potential determining ions .
gupta et al .   used spirogyra species for removal of cu(ii ) with the maximum adsorption capacity of 133.3  mg  g. use of adsorbents like mg pellets has also been reported for co(ii ) removal from water   and the adsorption capacity has been found to be 15.8  mg  g. the aim of this work is to study the best condition of temperature , sodium hydroxide concentration , and time required for synthesis of na - p1 zeolite from the local pumice raw material and utilize the synthetic zeolite as an adsorbent for removing ( cd , fe , cu , and co ) ions from synthetic solutions in a batch laboratory system .
