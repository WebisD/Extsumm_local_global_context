axial length of the eyeball , myopia , and low iol power appear to play a role in secondary ctr / iol complex dislocation within 5 years from primary cataract surgery . patients with cataracts or lens subluxation as the result of blunt eye trauma appear likely to remain stable with ctr .
preoperative diagnosis of lens subluxation increases the chances of secondary iol / ctr complex dislocation .
statistical significance remained in respect of axial length of the eyeball ( p = 0.009 ) , iol power ( p = 0.002 ) , refraction in spherical equivalent ( p = 0.001 ) , and preoperative diagnosis of zonule dehiscence ( p = 0.007 ) .
the axial length was 23.8  1.3 ( from 21 to 29 ) and in the group without dislocation 20.7  1.2 ( from 19 to 24 ) , p = 0.008 .
age and sex matched group of 26 eyes of 26 patients ( 17 male and 9 female ) aged from 56 to 85 ( mean 68.9  7.2 ) were randomly selected from 54 and analyzed as a control group .
there were no cases in the dislocation group and 7 ( 26.9% ) cases in the group without dislocation ( p = 0.04 ) .
