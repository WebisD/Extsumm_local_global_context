the combined fe - zn supplementation was as effective as iron alone in improving iron status but not effective in improving zinc status .
the objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of ifa supplements provided daily or weekly with and without zinc on iron and zinc status in a randomized control trial ( rct ) carried out in guatemalan wra .
recently , a meta - analysis examined the impact of zinc supplementation on biochemical indicators of iron and zinc .
  both daily and weekly supplementations were efficacious in improving hb concentration in anemic women . however , daily supplementation was more efficacious than weekly in improving ferritin levels .
no significant differences were found in ferritin levels in the daily groups between those with or without zinc ( p = 0.94 ) or in the weekly groups between those with or without zinc ( p = 0.38 ) .   the prevalence of anemia before supplementation was 13% and that of insufficient iron stores was 19.7% .
overall hb concentrations increased by 21.8  g / l ( 95% ci : 17.5 , 26.2 ) among anemic women but decreased by 4.8  g / l ( 6.5 ; 3.2 ) among nonanemic women ( data not shown ) .
