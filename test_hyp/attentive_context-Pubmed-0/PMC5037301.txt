the specific purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of new ap protocols for the treatment of cervical spinal cord diseases in 19 dogs .
additionally , dogs with ivdd needed at least four sessions to improve and seven sessions to recover , while those with ivdd and spondylosis deformans required three sessions to improve and five sessions to recover .
the dog with fibrocartilaginous embolism needed at least two sessions for improvement and six sessions to recover .
there are many commonly used ap points ( acupoints ) for cervical spinal disorders , including local points ( acupoints around the lesion ) and distant points ( acupoints distal to the lesion ) . in this study ,
however , the improvement and recovery times were significantly longer in the ap+eap group ( p < 0.05 ) .
we objectively evaluated the effects of ap from the functional clinical perspective ; however , more studies with greater numbers of subjects are needed to confirm our results and document the bio - molecular changes and mechanisms of treatment .
the mean duration of signs before tcvm integration was 12.7  17.6 days ( range , 360 ) , the mean improvement time was 11.3  7.2 days ( range , 430 ) and the mean recovery time was 16.9  23.0 days ( range , 790 ) .
