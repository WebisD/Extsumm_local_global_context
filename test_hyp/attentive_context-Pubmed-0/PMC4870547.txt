this cross - sectional controlled study was conducted on 340 women of reproductive age ( 25 - 50 years old ) selected through convenience sampling .
the frequency of hsdd and aversive sexual desire disorder was more common in the case group than the control group , and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , 73 women in the case group ( 46.2% ) and 20 in the control group ( 12.6% ) had sexual aversion disorder , with a significant difference between the two groups ( p < 0.05 ) . in this study ,
furthermore , 75 out of the 155 women in the case group ( 46.9% ) and 16 out of the 145 women in the control group ( 10% ) had hsdd , and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
another limitation of the study was a lack of control of other contributing factors , such as the economic status of the family and sexual disorders and duration of opioid dependency in addicted husbands , which are assumed to have an effect on their wives sexual dysfunctions .
thus , the present cross - sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of fsd among women with addicted partners . we hypothesized that substance dependency in males would affect their wives sexual function .
