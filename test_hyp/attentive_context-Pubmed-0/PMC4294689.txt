our study on the relapse of schizophrenia after a response to acute ect suggested that the number of ect sessions may be related to the risk of relapse . on the other hand , adjunctive pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers may be effective in preventing relapse .
following a response to the acute ect course , the relapse rates at 6 months , 1 year , and 2 years were 29.3% , 42.7% , and 51.6% , respectively .
the number of ect sessions was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse ( hazard ratio = 1.159 ; p=0.033 ) , and patients who used a mood stabilizer were at a lower risk of relapse than were patients who did not ( hazard ratio = 0.257 ; p=0.047 ) .
we investigated the factors that influence the risk of relapse in schizophrenic patients after demonstrating a response to ect .
a high neuroleptic dose before acute ect8 and the observation of self - harming behaviors at baseline7 seem to enhance the risk of relapse .
therefore , catatonia may not influence the effects of mood stabilizers after acute courses of ect . a prospective and well - designed study with a large sample size
