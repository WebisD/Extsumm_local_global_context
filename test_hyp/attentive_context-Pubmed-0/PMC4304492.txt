aac tends to have a more fulminant course , is frequently associated with gangrene , perforation and empyema , and has high morbidity and mortality.2 aac has traditionally been recognized to occur in patients with serious co - morbid illnesses especially after a major operation , severe trauma , burns , systemic sepsis and prolonged intravenous hyperalimentation.3 however , there has recently been an increasing number of reports in the literature of the occurrence of aac in patients with none of the established risk factors.4 - 6 aac arising as a complication of laparoscopic appendectomy has been reported in just 1 case and it was treated conservatively.7 herein , we present the case of a 38-year - old woman who developed aac after laparoscopic appendectomy .
a 38-year - old woman who was previously in good health came to our emergency room 3 days after she received laparoscopic appendectomy at a local clinic .
acute acalculous cholecystitis ( aac ) is defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones and has a multifactorial pathogenesis.1 aac occurs in about 10% of all cases of acute cholecystitis .
when abdominal pain , leukocytosis , fever and abnormal results of liver function tests are observed in patients after appendectomy , the possibility of aac should be considered .
