a 19-year - old female patient presented with short , rough , and unruly hair on the scalp since childhood .
spontaneous type of trichonodosis associated with abnormal scalp and body hair is a rare occurrence .
the scalp hairs were dry , curly , and short in length up to the nape of neck , transverse split ends ( trichoschisis ) were seen in majority of hairs [ figure 1 ] .
patient gave a history of knots getting caught in fine - toothed comb whenever the scalp was combed with breakage of few hairs .
this may be spontaneous or secondary to mechanical factors like vigorous scratching or combing the hair .
there are two types , one rare variety of unknown etiology involves abnormally growing scalp and body hair with spontaneous trichonodosis which is predisposed to splintering and fracturing . the second commoner type , encountered in patients with normal scalp and body hair , is considered secondary to mechanical forces such as combing and brushing .
