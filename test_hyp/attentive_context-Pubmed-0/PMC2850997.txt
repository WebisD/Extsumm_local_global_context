the ratio of bax to bcl-2 was increased by cataract formation . in contrast , catechin suppressed the ratio of bax to bcl-2 , showing that apoptosis was inhibited by catechin treatment . taken together , our results demonstrate that catechin alleviated cataract - induced apoptosis in lens epithelial cells .
catechin could potentially be used to delay cataractogenesis through the suppression of apoptotic cell death in the lens epithelium .
many studies have shown that egcg , the main component of catechin , inhibits the expression of pro - apoptotic genes such as bax , bad , and mdm2 , and that egcg increases the expression of anti - apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 , bcl - w , and bcl - xl . in the present study ,
2 . the number of tunel - positive cells was 8.302.78/section in the control group , 157.5010.26/section in the cataract - induction group , 143.308.94/mm in the cataract - induction and 50 mg / kg catechin group , 136.4011.36/section in the cataract - induction and 100 mg / kg catechin group , and 97.106.98/section in the cataract - induction and 200 mg / kg catechin group .
administration of catechin suppressed the expression of bax protein in a dose - dependent manner , but only slightly enhanced bcl-2 expression .
