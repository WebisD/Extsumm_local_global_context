finally , the method of semiquantitative analysis22 was used for the interpretation , where all markers were dichotomized into negative and positive groups.23 however , our findings might be useful in the pathologic diagnosis of distinction of types i and ii epithelial ovarian carcinoma .
the number of recurrences in the complete series was 34 ( 26% ) of 131 , and 22 of these patients died because of disease . in the complete series , recurrent disease was associated with figo substages ( p = 0.0005 ) , figo grade ( p = 0.030 ) , adequate surgical staging ( p = 0.033 ) , and residual disease ( p = 0.001 ) . the 5-year disease - free survival rate was 68% , the disease - specific survival rate was 76% , and the overall survival rate was 71% .
i - ii , the figo stage was a strong ( or , 8.0 ) predictive factor for tumor recurrence .
however , about 30% of those patients will have recurrent disease and survival that is comparable with survival after recurrent disease for patients with stage iii - iv disease.1 in our study limited to figo stages i - ii , the recurrence rate was 26% for all patients with types i and ii tumors in 1 group , and in multivariate analysis , the figo stage was the strongest ( odds ratio [ or ] , 4.7 ) clinical predictive factor for recurrent disease . in a study from canada26 on 605 patients in figo stages
