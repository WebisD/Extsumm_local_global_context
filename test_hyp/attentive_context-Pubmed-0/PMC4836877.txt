scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) was used 
 to investigate the microstructure as a function of the al : ga ratio . 

the success 
 in making a dense llzo sample with a li - ion conductivity 
 above 10 s cm and an asr of 
 about 20  cm described in this work bodes 
 well for the fabrication of devices with lithium anodes and llzo solid 
 electrolytes .
this , combined with the changes in microstructure , seems 
 to be the explanation for the almost linear increase in li - ion conduction . 

the change in 
 structure coincides with an increase in the bulk li - ion conductivity 
 from 3.0  10 s cm for 
 0 ga pfu to 10 s cm for 0.20 
 ga pfu , with two significant drops in the activation energy at x = 0.05 and 0.15 .
finally , we used 
 density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to explain the decrease 
 in activation energy observed with ga substitution by carefully examining 
 changes in the energy landscape .
in summary , a phase transition from ia3d to i43d occurs 
 with a critical amount of 0.15 ga pfu in ga and al cosubstituted samples 
 with general composition li6.4al0.2xgaxla3zr2o12 ( 0  x  0.2 ) .
