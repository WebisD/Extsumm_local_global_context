other complications occur later in the postoperative period , such as eyelid malposition , strabismus , scar and over- and under - resection of skin or orbital fat.1 
  there has been a case report of persistent lateral hooding after upper lid blepharoplasty that has been treated with lacrimal gland repositioning.2 
  to the best of our knowledge , we report the first case of lacrimal gland fistula after upper lid blepharoplasty .
surgeons who perform blepharoplasty should have a high index of suspicion for lacrimal gland herniation in the presence of lateral hooding specially in patients with a history of blepharochalasis .
the procedure can complex especially in the context of chronic inflammatory conditions.5 
  this case report illustrates an uncommon post - blepharoplasty complication in patients with blepharochalasis .
postoperative complications of blepharoplasty range from skin changes to vision - threatening emergencies.1 
  some of these complications occur early in the postoperative period , such as retrobulbar hemorrhage , infection , and eyelid hematoma .
despite the facile nature of the blepharoplasty , high patient expectations can make this procedure quite challenging to the surgeon . in order to attain a good result and avoid patient dissatisfaction , the surgeon must perform a careful history and physical exam and address specific patient complaints and expectations.3 blepharochalasis is a rare eyelid disorder characterized by exacerbation and remission of painless edema , eventually leading to atrophy of the periorbital skin .
