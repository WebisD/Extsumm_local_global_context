as hypothesized , present data support the notion that both neuroticism ( negative affect ) and experiential avoidance predict anxiety and depression symptoms independently ; and also mediate the effects of difficulties in emotion regulation and worry .
the current study aimed to assess the mediating roles of emotion regulation deficits and worry , as a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy , between experiential avoidance and neuroticism ( as independent variables ) , and anxiety and depression symptoms ( as dependent variables ) .
the mediating effect of emotion regulation in the relationship between negative affect and anxiety and depression was demonstrated previously ( 58 ) .
since watson and clark proposed the tripartite model , the important role of neuroticism or negative affectivity is underscored in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety and depression as a common factor ( 55 ) . in fact , individuals with high neuroticism may be more prone to anxiety and depression symptoms ( 56 , 57 ) .
a study using structural equation modeling tested the relationship between negative affect , emotion regulation and psychological distress in clinical and nonclinical samples ; it suggested that negative effect leads people to control negative emotions via maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and these lead to psychopathology ( 59 ) .
