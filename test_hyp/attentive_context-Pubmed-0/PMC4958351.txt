, we used the international prostate symptom score ( ipss ) questionnaire to evaluate the effects of pseudoephedrine on voiding function in asymptomatic males who received pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion treatment .
treatment with pseudoephedrine requires extra precautions in males aged > 50 years and in those with coexisting voiding symptoms .
the results of the questionnaire were analyzed as the ipss total ( ipss - t ) , ipss - v , ipss - s , and qol due to urinary symptoms ( qol - us ) .
the numbers and percentages of the patients with changes ( increased , unchanged , or decreased ) in the ipss - v , ipss - s , and qol - us scores after the treatment with pseudoephedrine are listed in table 2 .
of the 131 patients , the ipss - t score after the medication increased in 42 patients ( 32.1% ) .
the ipss - t , ipss - v , and ipss - s scores significantly increased after the medication ( ipss - t increased from 9.95 to 11.45 , ipss - v from 5.38 to 6.07 , and ipss - s from 4.57 to 5.38 ) , whereas the qol - us score nonsignificantly decreased from 2.71 to 2.48 ( p=0.057 ) . in the < 50-year group , all the scores decreased but not significantly .
