moreover , it was also shown that the severity of bronchiolar and alveolar damage was correlated with the volume and the duration of exposure to sidestream smoke .
in addition , it has also been reported that levels of cleaved parp are significantly higher in smokers than in ex - smokers or non - smoking glaucomatous groups of the same gender.29 our results showed that the increased levels of parp cleavages were associated with the increased volume of an exposure to sidestream smoke in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 . in groups 4 and 5 where the experimental rats were subjected to a long - term sidestream smoke , the level of parp cleavage were increased compared to the control group on the western blot analysis . in conclusion ,
our results indicate that sidestream smoke causes bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cell injury and this leads to alterations in bronchiolar mucosal cells as well as the early bronchiolocentric emphysematous change .
in contrast , the animals exposed to smoke for three and six months showed a peribronchiolar patchy inflammatory thickening , as well as irregularity and expansion of the alveolar ducts and alveolar spaces .
there were positive findings for the expression of il-1 in the alveolar macrophages of groups 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , there was a diffuse expression of ck14 ( score , 3 and 4 ) mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and basal cells and a focal expression in the alveolar cells . however ,
