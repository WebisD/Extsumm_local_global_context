we found only one study by simonds and thorpe in 2003 about the attitudes toward the different subtypes of ocd symptoms , for which undergraduate students were used as subjects.15 vignettes of different subtypes of ocd symptoms were used , and it was found that the vignette describing a person with doubting , violent , and blasphemous obsessions and related compulsions received the more negative social evaluations when compared with the vignette describing a person with cleansing rituals and checking compulsions.15 to our knowledge , no studies focusing on the attitudes of psychiatrists toward ocd patients have been published before . therefore , our research aimed to specifically study psychiatrists attitudes toward ocd patients .
the second part centers on their experience with ocd patients including the estimated number of ocd patients they used to have experience in treatment , the estimated time spent with ocd patients at their first visit and in follow - up sessions , their preferred mode of treatment for ocd , their experience and proficiency in exposure and response prevention ( erp ) , and finally their confidence in treating ocd patients with various approach .
most of the psychiatrists ( 76.9% ) had confidence in treating ocd patients , but the number of psychiatrists who had confidence in treating with medications ( 91.1% ) was much higher than those expressing confidence in behavioral therapy ( 51.7% ) and other psychotherapy ( 39.6% ) ( table 1 ) .
