we report a case of padf developfing 25 years after surgery and radiotherapy and successfully treated at our institution .
a 61-year - old man with a recent history of erosive gastritis and duodenal ulcer presented to the emergency department of our hospital with hematemesis , melena and circulatory collapse .
four cases of idiopathic padf are reported   , while seven cases of padf following abdominal radiotherapy for malignancy are described in the medical literature   .
aorto - enteric fistula is a direct communication between the abdominal aorta and the gastrointestinal tract .
endoscopy , ct scan and angiography can be useful in the evaluation of these patients , but are diagnostic in only a minority of cases and a high index of suspicion remains the key to prompt diagnosis and effective treatment .
a history of abdominal radiotherapy , no matter how many years before , should be carefully sought in all patients presenting with massive gastrointestinal bleeding .
our report confirms previous observations that high - energy radiation is a possible etiologic factor in spontaneous padf , and calls attention to the fact that a fistula may develop even decades after the completion of radiotherapy .
primary aorto - enteric fistula is defined as a spontaneous erosion of the aorta into the gastrointestinal tract   and must be distinguished from secondary aorto - enteric fistula that may complicate aortic surgery , including endovascular procedures , and is ten times more frequent   .
