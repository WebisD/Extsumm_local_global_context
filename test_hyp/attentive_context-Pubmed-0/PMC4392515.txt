, we report a case of congenital nasolacrimal duct mucocele , which recurred after surgery and was treated with endoscopic approach , followed by a literature review .
nasolacrimal duct obstruction ( nldo ) is a common congenital abnormality that occurs in 30% of neonates ( range 6 to 84%).1 only 2 to 4% of these children become symptomatic , and most cases of nldo resolve spontaneously in the first year of life.1

  dacryocystocele or congenital mucocele of nasolacrimal duct is a relatively rare variant of nldo , representing 0.1% of children with congenital obstruction , and results from the coexistence of a distal and a proximal obstruction.1

  nasolacrimal duct mucocele typically presents as a bulging in the lower medial canthus of the eye , associated with epiphora .
the patient was a 30-year - old man with a history of bilateral congenital cyst of nasolacrimal duct diagnosed by the presence of a bulge in both lacrimal sac topographies since birth , without associated symptoms .
however , the interest in an endoscopic nasal approach has increasingly grown as recent studies have shown good results with this technique , with similar success rates between the two types of procedures .
