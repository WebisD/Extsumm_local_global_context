assessment of the quality of asthma care in developing countries is imperative because of its increasing prevalence , huge socioeconomic and psychosocial burden , and under - treatment , which leaves much room for improvement.2 this study was carried out to audit the quality of acute asthma care in two tertiary hospitals in a state in the southwestern region of nigeria and compare the clinical practice against the gina guidelines .
the result from this first audit reveals that the acute management of asthma in our setting is suboptimal and there is a low level of compliance with most recommendations of the gina guideline .
, less than one - third of patients had an assessment of severity , smoking status , inhaler technique , and medication adherence documented .
the guideline was issued in 1995 and regularly revised to date.2 despite the effort to standardize asthma care using the gina guideline , several nigerian studies dating back to more than a decade have shown that there is under - treatment of asthma and poor adherence to the guideline by doctors.121314151617 the reduction of burden and outcome of asthma depend largely on achieving asthma control , adequate prevention , and treatment of an acute attack .
