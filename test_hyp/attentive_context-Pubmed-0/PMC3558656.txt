in this case , the possible cause of cardiac arrest includes : vasovagal response ; ventricular arrhythmia ; amniotic fluid embolism ( afe ) ; and anaphylaxis after the administration of cefazolin .
vasovagal response should be suspected , among the many potential causes of cardiac arrest during a cesarean section , especially when cardiac arrest occurs during placental expulsion .
careful history taking and preoperative evaluation , appropriate preload management , early recognition of vasovagal response by vigilant monitoring , and prompt treatment of hemodynamic collapse , were important lessons we have learned in this case .
in korea , this is the first case report of vasovagal cardiac arrest , during a spinal anesthesia for cesarean section .
this case illustrates a serious potential risk of vasovagal response superimposed on neuraxial anesthesia , during a cesarean section .
we believe that the vasovagal response should be the most probable cause of her cardiac arrest .
, we described a patient with severe vasovagal cardiac arrest , during the spinal anesthesia for cesarean section .
firstly , although the history of nsvt , of course , was one issue for abnormal cardiac activity , it was not the direct cause of cardiac arrest .
