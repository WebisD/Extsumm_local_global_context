several materials have been recommended to create a matrix including calcium sulfate , hydroxyapatite , resorbable collagen , and platelet - rich fibrin . in this case series , we are presenting two cases of mta apexification using polyglactin - based resorbable suture material as the apical matrix .
a 16-year - old male patient reported with a chief complaint of discolored maxillary left central incisor .
management of immature root with a necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis is a challenging task .
resorbable suture with a contrast agent may be used as a matrix for mta placement but properly designed clinical trials with long - term follow - up are mandatory to support this novel technique as there is no evidence of such procedure available in the literature presently .
research concentrating on the effect of suture material and contrast media on the healing kinetics can further through some light on this technique .
treatment of choice in such cases is the apexification procedure , i.e. , establishing an apical barrier .
a bonded restoration can be placed without any delay , thus reducing the possibility of root fractures .
apexification is defined as a method to induce a calcified barrier in a root with an open apex or the continued apical development of an incomplete root in teeth with necrotic pulp .
