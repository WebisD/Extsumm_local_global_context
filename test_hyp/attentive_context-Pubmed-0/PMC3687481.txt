the second aim of this study was to identify antigens serologically recognized on the adult worm by these children ( individually ) both before and 6 weeks after treatment , to assess whether antischistosome antibody changes following treatment were due to qualitative changes in antigens recognised by the host immune system as has been shown in adults .
with increasing calls for the inclusion of pre - school children and infants in mass chemotherapy programmes for schistosome control   , and studies in school children and adults suggesting that antihelminthic treatment not only affects immune responses directed against schistosomes but may also affect immune responses directed against unrelated antigens   , the current study aimed to investigate immunological consequences of praziquantel treatment in young pre - school age children .  
thus , the first aim of this study was to determine the short - term antihelminthic effects on immunological markers of exposure to schistosome ( igm directed against schistosome cercariae , egg , and adult worms ) and malaria ( igm directed against plasmodium total schizont ) infections as well as the effects on antibody responses associated with resistance to infection / reinfection ( ige and igg4 directed against schistosome cercariae , egg , and adult worms , igg directed against plasmodium vaccine candidates msp-1 and msp-2   ) in children aged 35 years in zimbabwe
