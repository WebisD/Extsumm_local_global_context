after rheohemapheresis , there was a significant morphological improvement of the damaged is / os layer , as evidenced by reduction of the scope of the defect or reattachment of the detached is / os layer either with or even without the defect of this layer . after 2.5 years of follow - up , better visual acuity , reduced dped size , and improvement of some functional parameters ( electroretinography findings ) were observed in the study group .
with the use of rheohemapheresis , preservation of photoreceptor is / os junction layer coherence in the fovea of patients with high - risk dry amd can be achieved , even when drusenoid retinal pigment epithelium detachment is already present .
when treating our patients suffering from the dry form of amd accompanied by reticular drusen or even drusenoid detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium , we noticed positive morphological changes of the retina after rheohemapheresis treatment , including the preservation of the photoreceptor inner / outer segment ( is / os ) junction , as well as stabilisation or even improvement of retinal function : best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) and electroretinography results . a description of the above changes and their correlation is the subject of this work .
