the aim of the present study was to determine the relationship of cvd risk , as defined by the framingham risk analysis method , with body fat distribution ( measured by clinical examination , bioelectrical impedance analysis [ bia ] , fat computed tomography [ ct ] and dual energy absorptiometry [ dxa ] ) .
the mean values of framingham scores were increased along the tertiles of crp and vat with increases of the tertiles of bmi ( all p  <  0.001 ) without any interaction ( p  =  0.509 and 0.054 , respectively ) .
, we found a strong positive relationship between rbp4 and framingham score , composite of cvd risk factors , at the degree of visceral adiposity .
variable , plasma levels of rbp4 were independently associated with men ( standardized coefficients   =  0.288 , p  <  0.001 ) , triglyceride (   =  0.239 , p  <  0.001 ) and vat (   = 0.152 , p  =  0.013 ) in participants without metabolic syndrome , and tg (   =  0.398 , p  =  0.002 ) and vat (   =  0.390 , p  = 0.002 ) in participants with metabolic syndrome ( data not shown ) .
