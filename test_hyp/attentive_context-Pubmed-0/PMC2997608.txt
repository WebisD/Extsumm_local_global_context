in conclusion , the cryoinfarction is associated with prolonged inflammatory response leading to a postponed granulation tissue formation and scar development , when compared to the reperfused myocardial infarction .
the cryolesioned heart showed a prolonged remodeling with postponed development of granulation tissue and scar formation , which was associated with persistent macrophage infiltration in the injured tissue when compared to reperfused infarction .
both models show a transient inflammatory response associated with induction of chemokines , cytokines , and remodeling - related mediators .
this study compares the pathology and the sequence of cellular and molecular events in the two mechanistically different lesion models of myocardial cryoinfarction and reperfused infarction and reveals substantial differences in myocardial remodeling between them .
we measured the induction of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il-10 to investigate negative feedback regulation of proinflammatory response ( figure 5(c ) ) and found a comparable time course in both models with a significantly higher induction of it in cryoinfarction after 3 days .
we developed a chronic , closed - chest murine model of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion , which leads to infarction with rapid scar formation .
the experimental models of myocardial infarction have largely contributed to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction . studies on large animal models revealed many mechanisms involved in myocardial injury and repair   . in the last few years , transgenic mice and gene targeting technologies allowed profound studies of the underlying pathomechanisms . for this purpose , we developed murine models of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion and used them to study the mechanisms involved in ischemic myocardial injury   .
