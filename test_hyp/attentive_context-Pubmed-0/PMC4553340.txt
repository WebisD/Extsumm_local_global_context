women with asymptomatic autoimmune thyroid disorders , who are euthyroid in early pregnancy , carry a significant risk of developing hypothyroidism progressively during gestation . the aim of this study was to estimate the significance of tsh , thyroid peroxidase antibody ( tpoab ) , and mild ( subclinical ) hypothyroidism in women from the danish general suburban population study ( gesus ) on the number of children born , the number of pregnancies , and the number of spontaneous abortions .
, we observed that impaired fertility is associated with tsh , tpoab , and mild ( subclinical ) hypothyroidism in a danish population of women .
mild ( subclinical ) hypothyroidism was associated with a risk of not having children and a risk of not getting pregnant in age - adjusted and multiadjusted models .
mild hypothyroidism was also associated with a higher age of first child born and risk of not having children and not getting pregnant . in conclusion
taken together , we observed that with higher tsh levels the less number of children born and the less number of pregnancies .
in the present study , we showed that with higher tsh levels the less number of children born and the less number of pregnancies .
