most cardiac metastases spread from the lungs ( in men ) and breasts ( in women ) . in other instances , they can spread by direct extension from the esophagus and mediastinum.3 we describe the echocardiographic and cardiac computerized tomography ( cct ) findings of a man in his 60s with an undifferentiated pancreatobiliary carcinoma and a left ventricular mass .
metastatic disease to the heart is not uncommon . a study conducted on autopsies of patients with a known non - cardiac primary malignant neoplasm revealed cardiac metastasis in 9.710.7% of cases.1 additional post - mortem studies
have quoted the number of cardiac metastases in patients who had died of malignancies as high as 25%.2 despite these differing reports , cardiac infiltration is commonly found in metastatic carcinoma . identification and characterization of metastatic cardiac disease necessitates differentiation of normal cardiac structures from the metastatic lesion .
the left ventricular masses were characterized by transthoracic echocardiography and cct , but diagnosis was inferred by hepatic fine needle biopsy .
a man in his 60s with a past medical history significant for hypertension presented to an outpatient urologist with microscopic hematuria , left flank pain , and a 10 pound weight loss over a month and a half .
