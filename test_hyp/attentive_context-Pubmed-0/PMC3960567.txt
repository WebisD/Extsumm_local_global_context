ameliorate myocardial injury and apoptosis in regional i / r induced by lad ligation in rats as evidenced by reduction in the release of cardiac specific enzyme troponin i. the findings of the present study support the idea that endogenous testosterone may have deleterious effect on myocardial injury and apoptosis during regional i / r .
compared with the sham group , levels of myocardial tnf- , il-1 , and icam-1 were increased ( p < 0.05 ) in control group .
both castration and goserelin acetate injection significantly counteract the increase in myocardial levels of tnf- , il-1 , and icam-1 ( p < 0.05 ) , but there was no significant difference between castrated group and goserelin treated group as shown in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 . compared with the sham group , levels of plasma ctn
myocardial apoptosis levels were increased ( p < 0.05 ) in control group . both surgical castration and goserelin injection
after the 1st week of acclimatization , the rats were randomized into 4 groups ( 6 rats in each group ) as follow.in sham group , rats underwent the same anesthetic and surgical procedures ( for an identical period of time for regional myocardial ischemia and reperfusion ) but without lad ligation.in control group ( induced untreated ) , rats underwent surgical operation for lad ligation and were subjected to 25  min of ischemia and 40  min of reperfusion.in castrated group , surgically castrated rats were left 4wks for recovery   and then underwent surgical lad ligation and were subjected to 25  min of ischemia and 40  min of reperfusion.in treated group ( goserelin treated ) , rats of this group take a s.c injection of goserelin acetate ( lhrh analogue ) 3  wks before the surgery   and then were subjected to surgical lad ligation with 25  min ischemia and 40  min of reperfusion . in sham group , rats underwent the same anesthetic and surgical procedures ( for an identical period of time for regional myocardial ischemia and reperfusion ) but without lad ligation . in control group
