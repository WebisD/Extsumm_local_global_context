, no differentiation was made between the roles of the jnk subtypes in the signaling pathways of the three individual proinflammatory cytokines . since jnk subtype activation is stimulus dependent and as il-1 is indispensable in the proapoptotic combination of inflammatory cytokines , the action of tnf- and inf- being mainly to synergize with il-1 , it is important to investigate the differential role of the jnk subtypes in stimulus - specific pancreatic -cell signalling . here , we investigated the individual roles of jnk1 , jnk2 , and jnk3 in il-1-induced apoptosis in insulin - producing ins-1 cells and provide evidence for a critical role of jnk1 in mediating il-1-induced -cell apoptosis , whereas jnk2 but not jnk3 conferred protection .
we propose that the jnk1-myc pathway may be a target for protecting pancreatic -cells from inflammatory stress , and thus a potential treatment target in diabetes .
in summary , this study suggests that jnk1 is a key mediator of il-1-induced ins-1 cell apoptosis , that the transcription factor myc is regulated specifically by jnk1 , and that myc may mediate the apoptotic actions of jnk1 .
gene expression profiling studies followed by functional characterization of candidate genes have demonstrated that the exposure of insulin - producing cell lines , fluorescence - activated cell - sorted primary rodent -cells , intact rodent islets , and human islets to proinflammatory cytokines induces not only upregulation of proapoptotic / downregulation of antiapoptotic genes , but also a protective response including downregulation of proapoptotic / upregulation of antiapoptotic genes , with a high degree of concordance between the different model systems   .
