thus , the aim of this study was to assess changes in screening intention after learning about overdiagnosis among women who had prior experiences with cancer screening and to determine factors with the greatest influence thereon .
a decrease in intention to undergo screening was more likely in women who graduated high school ( aor , 2.82 ; 95% ci , 1.09 to 7.35 ) and map recipients ( aor , 4.29 ; 95% ci , 1.58 to 11.63 ) .
women with stronger beliefs on the efficacy of cancer screening were less likely to change their intentions ( aor , 0.37 ; 95% ci , 0.21 to 0.65 ) .
data were acquired from subjects included in the 2013 korean national cancer screening survey ( kncss ) , an annual cross - sectional survey conducted to examine screening rates among koreans for five common cancers ( gastric , liver , colorectal , breast , and cervix ) through nationally representative random sampling .
only 13.8% of respondents who showed positive intentions changed their intentions to negative after receiving information about overdiagnosis ; this decrease in the percent of women with positive intentions to undergo thyroid cancer screening was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) .
