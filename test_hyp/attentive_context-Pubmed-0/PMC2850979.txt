the aim of this project was to characterise current management of adult patients with possible occult scaphoid fracture in australasia .
management of suspected scaphoid fractures with normal x - rays at emergency department ( ed ) presentation is a common clinical challenge .
the traditional approach to management of possible occult scaphoid fracture of immobilisation with re - x - ray at 710  days remains the most commonly used in australasia , despite evidence that this is probably over - treatment with significant consequences for patients .
traditional management would see the patient immobilised in a plaster cast for 714  days followed by clinical examination and re - x - ray to identify fractures not visible on the initial films . that approach can been challenged on two fronts : whether cast immobilisation while awaiting clinical review is justified and the role of alternative imaging modalities at or near the time of initial presentation .
there has long been concern that failure to identify and immobilise a scaphoid fracture might result in avascular necrosis or non - union with significant functional impact for the patient and potential medico - legal risk for the practitioner .
this was an internet - based survey of directors of emergency medicine training ( demt ) throughout australasia as identified from the australasian college for emergency medicine web - site ( www.acem.org.au ) .
