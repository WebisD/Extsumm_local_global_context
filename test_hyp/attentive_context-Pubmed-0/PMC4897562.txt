there was no significant difference in the incidence of three - rooted mandibular first molars between females ( 7/185 ) and males ( 5/137 ) ( table 1 ) .
however , there was a significant difference between the right side ( 8/12 ) and the left side ( 4/12 ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the percentage of permanent mandibular first molar teeth with three roots in a palestinian population using conventional digital x - rays in two different angles .
general practitioners as well as specialists in endodontics should always think about a possible third root ( re ) when planning a root canal treatment for a mandibular first molar .
three hundred and twenty two mandibular first molars from 185 females and 137 males of different ages scheduled for root canal treatment at the dental center of the arab american university were included in this clinical investigation .
careful clinical and radiographic examination is indispensable in the diagnosis of any anatomic variation in the root canal system of any tooth prior to initiating treatment .
as this study revealed that the incidence of a third root in palestinian population was within the range of previous reports from the middle east but considerably lower than the percentage from the far east , the use of conventional two - dimensional radiographs for the assessment of re would be probably considered as a limitation in the clinical approach and methodology of this study .
