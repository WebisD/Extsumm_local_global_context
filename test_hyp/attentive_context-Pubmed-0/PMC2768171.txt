improved understanding of the influence of both photoperiod and ambient temperature on bat function is likely to lead to the development of novel treatments for obesity .
obesity is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality , and there has been considerable recent interest in studying the physiology of bat in humans , given its protective role against obesity in animal experiments ( 6 ) . a greater understanding of bat function could thus help to develop treatment strategies for obesity , especially because it appears that white adipocyte area is smaller in individuals possessing ucp-1 ( 13 ) .
it has been suggested that bat activity may in part relate to increased expression of ucp-1 in cancer patients ( 30 ) . in the present study , however , bat was shown to be present in a significant proportion of noncancer patients , as well as those that were in remission , indicating that the presence of bat is not exclusively due to cancer - related factors . in conclusion , our large retrospective study demonstrates the presence of a strong seasonal variation in bat activity ( 9 ) both in a cohort and in individual patients .
frequency of reporting of bat - positive anatomical depots with average age in years for each depot in male patients , 2.8% of scans demonstrated bat activity ( n = 60/2,131 ) compared with 7.2% of scans in female patients ( n = 107/1,483 ) . the difference between male and female patients was highly significant ( p = 0.00005 ,  test ) .
