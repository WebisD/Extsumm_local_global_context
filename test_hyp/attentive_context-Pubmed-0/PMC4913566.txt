hypoglycin a concentrations differed significantly among the sample types ( seeds and sprouts , p < .001 ; seeds and leaves , p < .001 ; sprouts and leaves , p = .000 ) .
concentrations were significantly higher in seeds from the am group than in seeds from the nonam group ( seeds , 856  677 versus 456  358 mg / kg ; p = .039 ) . in sprouts , ( 1365  795 mg /
kg versus 1097  310 , p = .493 ) and leaves ( 31  49 versus 37  34 mg / kg , p = .819 ) this was not the case and when values for all seeds , sprouts , and leaves were combined the difference between nonam and am was not significant either ( p = .127 ) ; ( table 1 ) .
the concentration ( mg / kg ) of hypoglycin a in samples of acer pseudoplatanus taken from pastures or paddocks grazed by healthy horses and horses with atypical myopathy ( am ) concentration significantly different between pastures used by healthy and am horses ( p = 0.039 ) .
our results are consistent with a study that found hypoglycin a concentrations in seeds to be highly variable among trees on the same or different farms.17 hypoglycin a concentrations in our study were similar to those previously reported.17 in the previous study , a mean concentration of 690 mg / kg was found with variation between 40 and 2810 mg / kg and in our study a mean of 856 mg / kg with variation between 25 and 3683 mg / kg was found
