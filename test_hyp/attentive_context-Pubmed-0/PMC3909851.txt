this study on the interobserver and intermodality agreement demonstrated that the tof mra provided sufficient accuracy in the screening for aneurysm recurrence after enterprise stent - assisted coil embolization , especially with the evaluation of the si , in addition to mip images in the tof mra .
therefore , we evaluated the interobserver and intermodality agreement in the interpretation of the time of flight ( tof ) mra for the follow - up of coiled intracranial aneurysms with the enterprise stent for the diagnosis of recanalization and in - stent stenosis .
this study on the interobserver and intermodality agreement demonstrated that the tof mra provided sufficient accuracy in the screening for aneurysm recurrence after enterprise stent - assisted coil embolization , especially with the evaluation of the si , in addition to mip images in the tof mra .
the discrepancy between observers was caused by the following : the confusion between the normal branch and the recanalized portions due to signal loss induced by the stent ( n = 5 ) , measurement differences in the degree of recurrence ( n = 2 ) , and the difference of interpretation in the cases of small recanalized portions that were parallel to the axial acquisition of the stented artery ( n = 2 ) .
