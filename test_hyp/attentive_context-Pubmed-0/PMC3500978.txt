we report a rare case of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection of the silicone rod after frontalis sling surgery .
nontuberculous mycobacterial may be responsible for bilateral delayed infection after frontalis surgery with silicone slings in an immunocompetent adult .
a 65-year - old apparently healthy male presented with complaints of pain and swelling of both eyelids of 2  months duration .
frontalis sling surgery is the treatment option for myopathic blepharoptosis with poor levator muscle action .
surgical removal of infected slings and prolonged course of antibiotics are required for complete resolution .
nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in the periocular region are rare and are usually caused by organisms belonging to runyon group iv including mycobacterium chelonae and mycobacterium fortuitum .
first is that a bilateral infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria involving the silicone rod after frontalis sling surgery has not been reported earlier .
finally , removal of the silicone sling did not result in a recurrence of blepharoptosis .
treatment usually involves surgical debridement with removal of infected foreign body and a prolonged course of antibiotics like amikacin , clarithromycin , ciprofloxacin , and doxycycline .
the median time interval between prior surgery and onset of infection in these reports was 6  weeks ( range 0.511  months )   . in our patient , multiple erythematous nodules with suppuration along the tract of the silicone rod more than 2  years after surgery led to the suspicion and eventual diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacteria . some aspects in our patient need to be highlighted .
