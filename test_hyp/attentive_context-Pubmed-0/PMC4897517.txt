the high organic matter content , low bulk density , and low compressibility of the soil contributed to buffering the harvest impacts and made this soil conducive for intensive forest management and ground based harvesting systems .
soil physical properties particularly soil bulk density , soil strength , and total soil porosity were greatly affected by compaction which was brought by harvesting and logging . however , the extent of disturbance was not detrimental for early growth of planted pinus kesiya .
therefore , the present study was undertaken to determine the impacts of soil disturbance and compaction on soil physical properties and tree growth and the effectiveness of tillage in maintaining or enhancing site productivity for intensively managed pinus kesiya sites in the study area using prospective approach .
the results indicate that there were no significant ( p > 0.05 ) differences in mean height , stem basal diameter , diameter at breast height , stem volume index , and mortality for trees growing on compacted , compacted plus tillage , and noncompacted treatments at years one to three .
soil compaction could also be considered to be beneficial to early tree growth at three years .
increased water available in the 20 to 400  kpa range on compacted traffic lanes may explain this increased growth .
