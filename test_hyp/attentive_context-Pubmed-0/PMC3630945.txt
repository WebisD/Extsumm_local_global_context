this study presents clear molecular evidence that pigs and humans were concurrently infected with the same strain of influenza a virus at an ohio county fair in july 2012 .
influenza a ( h3n2 ) viruses containing the m gene from the influenza a ( h1n1 ) pdm09 virus ( h3n2pm ) were detected in 31 of the 34 swine nasal swabs using rrt - pcr and h3n2pm viral isolates were recovered from 29 of the 31 rrt - pcr - positive samples .
, we have conducted a prospective influenza a virus surveillance study among pigs exhibited at county fairs in ohio . in july 2012 , as part of routine sampling , h3n2pm viruses ( h3n2 influenza a viruses containing the matrix ( m ) gene from the influenza a ( h1n1 ) pdm09 virus ) were recovered from pigs at a county fair associated with concurrent cases of human h3n2v infections among its participants . here
we report that next generation sequencing of the complete h3n2pm virus genomes , isolated from pigs at the fair , exhibited > 99% similarity at the nucleotide level to h3n2v isolates concurrently recovered from the human cases .
the most recent ancestors of all the genetic segments of the h3n2v / h3n2pm viruses can be found in various triple reassortant h3n2 , h1n2 and h1n1 influenza a viruses which have been detected in pigs in north america .
