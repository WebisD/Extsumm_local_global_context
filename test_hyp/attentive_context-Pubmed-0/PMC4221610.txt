secondary outcomes were guideline development center , primary care membership of gdg , recommendations for further primary care research , whether  grading of recommendations assessment , development and evaluation  ( grade ) was used to assess the quality of evidence , and the clarity of links from the recommendation back to the supporting evidence base .
there was a wide variation across guidelines in the percentage of both recommendations and supporting publications that were relevant to primary care . in some guidelines ( eg ,  pregnancy and complex social factors  ) both the recommendations ( 100% ) and the evidence base ( 74% ) were judged to be relevant to primary care .
what is new?the applicability of clinical practice guidelines to primary care has been questioned for individual conditions such as hypertension and depression , and concerns have been raised about guidelines promoting overtreatment of low - risk populations.until now , evidence from a systematic appraisal of the relevance to primary care of published guidelines has been lacking.nearly two - third of the research cited in support of national institute for health and care excellence guideline recommendations for primary care was of uncertain relevance to primary care patients , with little or no acknowledgment of this uncertainty.guideline development groups should more clearly identify which recommendations are intended for primary care and uncertainties about the relevance of the supporting evidence to primary care patients , to avoid potential overtreatment and adverse effects .
