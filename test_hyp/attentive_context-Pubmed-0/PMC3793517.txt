effect of h. pylori eradication therapy , standard and sequential ( n=9 and 7 respectively ) , on urea breath test ( expressed as percentages of the total number of cases ) effect of helicobacter pylori eradication therapy , standard and sequential ( n=9 and 7 respectively ) , on mean serum ferritin after treatment ( mean sf after tx ) in case of success and failure of h. pylori eradication ( negative and positive urea breath test respectively ) effect of h. pylori eradication therapy , standard and sequential ( n=9 and 7 respectively ) , on serum ferritin ( ng / ml ) effect of helicobacter pylori eradication therapy , standard and sequential ( n=9 and 7 respectively ) , on mean serum ferritin after treatment ( mean sf after tx ) irrespective of h. pylori eradication
six weeks after completion of therapy , h. pylori test on c - ubt was negative in 5 ( 55.6% ) of nine patients in the standard and in 4 ( 57.1% ) of 7 patients in the sequential groups .
this study was therefore designed to investigate , which h. pylori eradication regimen ; sequential or standard ; more effectively improves the associated iron status and iron deficiency in children .
