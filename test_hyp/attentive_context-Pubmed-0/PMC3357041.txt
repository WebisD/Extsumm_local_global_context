thus , a study was designed to clinically evaluate the effect of miswak stick as an adjunct to tooth brushing on plaque levels and gingival health in subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate chronic generalized marginal gingivitis in comparison with those of toothbrush users .
our results showed significant improvement in plaque score and gingival health when miswak was used as an adjunct to tooth brushing .
student 's t test showed statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) reduction of gingival score in group b , when compared with group a and group c , respectively .
student 's t test done for detecting a difference at specific time intervals showed statistically significant ( p<0.0001 ) decrease in plaque score in group b compared to group a and group c , respectively , from 2 to 8 week . whereas , there was no statistical significant difference found when group a was compared with group c ( p>0.05 ) from 2 to 4 week . at the 6 and 8 weeks
henceforth , in future , a well - designed study is required to ascertain the efficacy of miswak or miswak extract in the treatment of gingival diseases .
data analyzed by repeated measure of anova for time and cleaning method interactions showed a significant reduction in plaque score ( f=20.612 ; p<0.0001 ) from baseline to 8 week in all the groups .
