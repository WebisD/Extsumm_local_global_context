then , the validity of the method was tested with two well - characterized 
 cu(ii ) binding peptides .
we determined 
 that only a single histidine residue is coordinated to cu(ii ) ion 
 in component ii in a. finally , in component ii , cu(ii ) uses 
 his 13 and his 14 as an equatorial ligand over his 6 .
we experimentally validated the use of eseem intensities to quantify 
 the number of n nuclei coupled to a cu(ii ) ion . a monotonic 
 increase in the n eseem intensities
shedding light into the component ii coordination was critical 
 as component ii might be the dominant cu(ii ) coordination mode of 
 a in vivo .
herein , we propose a method to quantify the number 
 of n nuclei coordinated to a cu(ii ) center by the use 
 of integrated 
 intensities of the fourier - transformed eseem .
eseem spectroscopy is 
 a pulsed esr technique that has been used to identify and quantify 
 the number of histidine imidazoles coupled to a cu(ii ) center .
two small peptides with known cu(ii ) coordination was used 
 to test the validity of the method . the dahk 
the proportions 
 of the three histidine residues in cu(ii ) coordination can be rationalized 
 by the pka values of the histidine side 
 chains .
