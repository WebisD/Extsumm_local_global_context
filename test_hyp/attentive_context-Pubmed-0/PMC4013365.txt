2 , 
 is a useful procedure from the following viewpoints : 1 ) the thinly sliced and hydrated 
 sections allow penetration of antibodies ; 2 ) the gold enhanced by silver provides fine 
 information of immunoreactive cells at the light microscopic level ; and 3 ) the investigator 
 can observe the same cell under a light microscope and the electron microscope .
, the present study is the first to report the advantages of 
 the reprocessing method with sliced paraffin sections , which not only provides information 
 on secretory granules containing an amino acid peptide , but is also inexpensive , does not 
 require special devices and can effectively use precious samples that are already 
 paraffin - embedded and unable to be obtained twice , such as the case for endangered animals 
 and rare pathological tissues . in addition , this method may contribute to ethical ideas that 
 have led to a required reduction in the number of laboratory animals used by researchers .
immunoreactive cells for the glp-1 antiserum , so - called l - cells , were observed in the full 
 length of the distal ileum in prlsb and prcg under a light microscope .
this study 
 is the first to identify the ultrastructure of secretory granules containing an amino acid 
 peptide ( glp-1 ) obtained from paraffin - embedded and sliced sections with similar evaluation 
 results to pocg , which is a commonly used method for post - embedding immunocytochemical 
 studies .
