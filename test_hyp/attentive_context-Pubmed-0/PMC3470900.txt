in this study , a highly efficient optimization method by combining plackett - burman design , steepest ascent , and box - behnken design was developed . this method was demonstrated to be effective in selecting the significant factors and enhancing succinic acid production in a. succinogenes atcc 55618 fermentation .
glucose , yeast extract , and mgco3 were screened to be key factors for the succinic acid production . a maximal succinic acid production of 52.7  0.8  g  l was obtained with 84.6  g  l glucose , 14.5  g  l yeast extract , and 64.7  g  l mgco3 .
, we proposed the optimization method including the following steps : ( 1 ) using a two - level pbd to identify the key medium components and their experimental levels for further optimization , ( 2 ) applying the path of steepest ascent ( sa ) to move rapidly towards the neighborhood of the optimum response , and ( 3 ) employing a box - behnken design ( bbd ) to develop mathematical models to estimate the relationships between the response ( i.e. , the succinic acid production ) and the key components .
this result agreed with the predicted value well and was 67.3% higher than that obtained with the basic medium .
