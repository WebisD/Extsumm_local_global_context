1 , a and   b ) . these results demonstrate that cd3-transduced signals   can induce cd4 commitment in dp thymocytes in the absence of clonotypic tcr chains and in the absence of   tcr chains . to determine whether signals transduced by tcr   chains were able to induce cd4 commitment , we assessed   lineage commitment in dp thymocytes from rag2 mice   that expressed a chimeric transgenic protein consisting of   the external and transmembrane domains of human cd25   and the cytosolic domains of tcr ( 24 ) .
that is , the instructional model can not explain the presence of any lineage - committed rag2 thymocytes in response to lineage - neutral cd3 and tcr signals , whereas the stochastic / selection   model can not explain why cd3 and tcr signals only   induced rag2 thymocytes to become cd4 committed   without inducing an equal number to become cd8 committed .
thus , cd4 commitment is induced in dp thymocytes by cd3 signals that are   of sufficient intensity to upregulate cd5 expression .
cd3 signals , and ( b ) demonstrate that cd3   signals stimulated by anti - cd3 mabs are sufficient to induce dp thymocytes to selectively terminate cd8 coreceptor synthesis and commit to the cd4 lineage , even in   the absence of clonotypic tcr chains .   to determine whether signals transduced by tcr chains   are indispensable for induction of cd4 commitment , we   generated double knockout rag2tcr mice . in vivo   injection of anti - cd3 mabs into ragtcr double   knockout mice induced the generation of dp thymocytes ,   as has been described ( 31 ) , and signaled these cells to upregulate cd5 expression ( fig .
