the aim of the present study was to assess carotid intima media thickness ( cimt ) as a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis in metabolically healthy obese ( mho ) subjects as compared to healthy nonobese subjects .
age , sex , sbp , bmi , wc , homa - ir , tg , ldl - c , and igf-1 were entered in the regression model .
cimt is elevated and igf-1 is reduced in mho subjects , and cimt is independently associated with male gender , middle age , and igf-1 .
cimt was positively correlated with age , bmi , wc , sbp , homa - ir , tg , and ldl - c and negatively correlated with igf-1 .
mho subjects had significantly higher sbp , fasting insulin , homa - ir , tg , ldl - c , crp , and cimt ( 0.78  0.15 versus 0.67  0.10 ) and significantly lower hdl - c and igf-1 ( 203.7  40.3 versus 229.4  57.5 ) than those of healthy nonobese subjects .
confirmed that the risk of cvd and mortality is elevated in mho individuals compared to metabolically healthy and lean individuals .
the main finding was elevated cimt and reduced igf-1 in mho subjects ; furthermore , imt in mho subjects was independently associated with male gender , middle age , and igf-1 .
