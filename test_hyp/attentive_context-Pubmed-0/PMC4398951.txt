alzheimer 's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by cognitive impairment that ultimately leads to dementia . in the present study , we investigated transcriptional alterations and the eeg phenotype of 5xfad mice .
though recent studies have gained substantial insight into the etiopathogenesis of ad , we are still lacking detailed information about how septohippocampal dysfunction results in altered theta rhythmicity and neuronal hyperexcitability activity in ad . in this study we combined seizure analysis , time - frequency - based theta analysis , and transcriptome data to elicit systemic cortical and hippocampal network alterations in the 5xfad model of ad .
interestingly , deletion of app   and bace1 , the secretase that participates in a release , also causes an epileptic phenotype , indicating that normal app signaling is important for the development of hippocampal excitability . in some models , lower thresholds for induced or spontaneous seizures are found even in the absence of amyloid deposits , further stressing the role of soluble forms of a as a pathogen   .
in addition , stereological quantification of pyramidal neurons of the ca1 layer showed no significant difference between the number of neurons of wt and 5xfad mice ; however a significant loss was detected in cortical layer 5 .
