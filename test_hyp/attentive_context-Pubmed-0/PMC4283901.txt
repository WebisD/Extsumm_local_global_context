patients of group ii compared to group i were younger ( p = 0.0002 ) , with prevalence of women ( 58 vs. 43% , p = 0.25 ) , and less frequently burdened with arterial hypertension ( p = 0.03 ) . in this group
the crucial factors of high risk of te in group ii were age , female gender and vascular disease , particularly myocardial infarction .
moreover , group ii patients had a lower value of has - bled ( p = 0.03 ) .
anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is highly effective at reducing thromboembolic events ( te ) , but is associated with a higher risk of major bleeding compared to new oral anticoagulants [ antithrombotic drugs  xa ( rivaroxaban , apixaban ) and iia inhibitors ( dabigatran ) ]   .
compared to men , women had significantly more often a history of ischemic stroke ( 2 vs. 18% , p = 0.03 ) , but less coronary heart disease ( 58 vs. 25% , p = 0.005 ) .
the reclassifying approach with the implications of cha2ds2-vasc and has - bled schemata provides some improvement over the chads2 score , with the identification of real low and high risk patients . in the era of antiplatelet therapy
