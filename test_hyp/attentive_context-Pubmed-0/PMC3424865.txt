the present study has considered asthma activity over the last month prior to patients evaluations using internationally valid and reliable test , namely asthma control test ( act).  the relation between autonomic modulation and the duration of bronchial asthma was also appraised .
characteristics of studied asthmatic patients m  sd of hrv indices in studied asthmatic patients lf norm and hf norm of studied asthmatic patients lf / hf norm of studied asthmatic patients the correlations between act state and hrv indices following adjustment for mhr and anti - asthma medications , act score correlates positively with both lf norm ( cc = 0.302 , p = 0.002 ) and lf / hf ( cc = 0.212 , p = 0.036 ) and negatively with hf norm ( cc = -0.317 , p = 0.001 ) .
results were interesting and revealed that poor asthma control is associated with depressed sympathetic and enhanced parasympathetic modulations especially in those with longer asthma duration .
this study aims to evaluate the pattern of autonomic modulations in asthmatic patients based on short - term hrv studies .
all studied asthma classes , namely well controlled , poorly controlled , and uncontrolled asthmatic patients , had long - standing history of asthma ( m  sd = 17.88  10.55 , 8.93  6.97 and 10.93  8.14 years , respectively ) .
