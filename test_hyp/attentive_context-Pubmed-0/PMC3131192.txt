transcutaneous immunization onto a skin area pretreated with microneedles with the protein antigen carried by nanoparticles induced a stronger antigen - specific antibody response than using the protein antigen alone . the antigen dose used to immunize the mice determined whether the microneedle - mediated immunization can induce a stronger immune response than when the same nanoparticle - based vaccine formulation was dosed by subcutaneous injection .
damage to the physical integrity of the skin caused by microneedles , although reversible , may permit permeation of live bacteria through the skin , but the risk of bacterial infection associated with microneedles is not expected to be higher than that associated with injection using a hypodermic needle . with the increasing interest in nanoparticles as a drug delivery system , more research on skin permeation of nanoparticles prior to or after microneedle treatment is warranted .
bacteria and viruses are physically nanoparticles or microparticles . therefore , any micropores that allow the permeation of nanoparticles might also allow permeation of bacteria and viruses . it is generally assumed that the risk of infection associated with microneedle treatment is low , and many microneedle - related safety studies in clinical trials have focused on the degree of irritation and pain caused by the microneedles.3033 the first study on the ability of microbes to traverse microneedle - induced micropores was reported by donnelly et al , whereby permeation of microbes through porcine skin pretreated with a microneedle array ( 280 m long , base diameter 250 m ) was confirmed in vitro.34 in the present study , an ex vivo model was designed to evaluate permeation of live bacteria through a mouse skin area pretreated with microneedles of different sizes . a nonpathogenic escherichia coli dh5 strain was used for this study .
