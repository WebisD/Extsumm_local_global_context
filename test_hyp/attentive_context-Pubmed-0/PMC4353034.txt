in the previous studies , the eos distilled from seven local medicinal plants of southern parts of iran were prepared and their main constituents were identified by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry ( table 1 ) . concerning the emergence of resistance to antibiotics in the past decades , their unavoidable adverse effects and regarding the global tendency towards using natural products and phytochemicals in medicine , the present study was conducted to evaluate antimicrobial activity of the seven common eos , as listed in table 1 , against the common causes of oral infections .
these results supported the idea of using eos in mouthwashes and denture cleansers , since they show high efficacy in inhibiting microbial strains , even in the plantitic form . furthermore , anti - inflammatory activity ( 41 , 42 ) and pleasant odor and flavor of these eos are additional advantages to their antimicrobial activities to be used as a mouth rinse and other oral hygienic products .
the eos inhibited the growth of examined bacteria at concentrations of 0.062 - 4 l / ml , except e. faecalis , which was inhibited at concentration of 0.125 - 16 l / ml .
