this study examines the use of the mna and short - form mna ( mna - sf ) ( with a revised scoring system to better suit the elderly chinese population5 ) in assessing the nutritional status of elderly chinese lung cancer inpatients prior to scheduled surgery .
significant correlations were found between bmi and mna scores ( p = 0.000 ) ; mna scores of well - nourished at risk of malnutrition , and malnourished patients ( p < 0.001 ) ; the bmi of well - nourished and malnourished patients ( p < 0.05 ) ; and the calf circumference ( cc ) of well - nourished and at risk of malnutrition patients with malnourished patients ( p < 0.05 ) .
the high incidence rates of preoperative malnutrition and risk of malnutrition among elderly chinese lung cancer inpatients highlights the need for further investigations to determine the relationship between nutritional status and prognosis of these patients .
malnutrition can lead to increased risk of surgery , decreased quality of life , increased incidence of postoperative complications , increased fatality rate , and decreased survival rate among elderly lung cancer inpatients.1,2 nutrition support has also been reported to improve the perioperative nutritional status and reduce the severity of postoperative complications in lung cancer.3 in the people s republic of china , the number of elderly lung cancer inpatients is increasing at a rapid rate ; thus , there is a great need to develop a tool that can accurately and effectively assess the nutritional status of these patients . the mini - nutritional assessment ( mna ) is a tool that is widely used in the usa and europe to evaluate patients nutritional status .
