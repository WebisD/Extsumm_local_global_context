however , the latent status can be switched to the productive lytic cycle by certain inducers , or constantly low replication rates can be found . in this report , we describe the use of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) assays , enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) , southern and western blotting for the detection of latent and active forms of the human pathogenic viruses ( ebv , hbv , hcv , hiv-1 , htlv - i and -ii ) , smrv , and retroviruses in general in a large panel of continuous primate cell lines to determine the potential risk for handling these cell lines .
the retroviruses hiv-1 and htlv - i and ii infect human t cells and are involved in the development of aids and the adult t - cell leukemia , respectively .
regarding ebv , the inducibility of the lytic cycle was investigated by treatment of the latently infected cell lines with the phorbol ester 12-o - tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( tpa ) and sodium butyrate ( na - butyrate ) .
in summary , we showed that human and other primate cell lines directly obtained from a biological resource center do not carry high - risk viral contaminants and thus do not represent safety risks for cell culturists .
