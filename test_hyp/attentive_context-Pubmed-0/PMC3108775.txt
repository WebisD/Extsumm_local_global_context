patients with t - cell all and the m4 and m5 subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukemia are at a higher risk for extramedullary disease , including renal parenchymal involvement , which is the most frequent extramedullary metastatic site.1 consequences of leukemic infiltration of the kidneys are asymptomatic bilateral renal enlargement , acute renal failure , and/or secondary hypertension , as reported previously . we report a patient with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) , receiving hemodialysis , and uncontrolled hypertension due to leukemic cell infiltration of the kidneys .
acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) , while frequently diagnosed in children , can also be seen in adulthood .
in conclusion , pathological findings such as uncontrolled hypertension , flank pain , skin rashes , and abnormal blood count could be a part of a systemic disease or malignany in patients with esrd who are receiving renal replacement therapy .
we initiated antifungal therapy and the patient was entubated in an intensive care unit . despite the intensive therapy , he died secondary to respiratory failure .
a 34-year - old man who had esrd was admitted to the emergency room with complaints of productive coughing , shortness of breath , and hypertension not controlled by his previous antihypertensive medication .
