we retrospectively reviewed a prospective database of 3310 consecutive women with early - stage breast cancer treated with breast - conserving surgery and radiation therapy from 1980 to 2005 .
patient selection includes ibtr 3  cm or less in size , without imaging evidence of multicentricity , and an interval to recurrence of greater than 1 year .
to better identify candidates who could have been eligible for a salvage apbi protocol , we studied the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 157 ibtrs after salvage mastectomy to identify factors associated with a favorable recurrence profile .
the ibtr was sensitive in 9 of 20 ( 45% ) . among the 90 patients with a clinical t1 ibtr , pathology from salvage mastectomy was available for 75 patients . in 71 of 75 patients ( 95% ) with clinical t1 ibtr
approximately 1020% of patients with stage i or ii invasive breast cancer will develop an ibtr by 10 years after breast - conserving surgery and rt   .
there were more palpable tumors at time of initial diagnosis ( 55% ) compared with ibtr ( 41% ) .
inclusion criteria for this study were primary breast cancer ; american joint committee on cancer 6th edition initial cancer stages 0 , i , or ii ; initial treatment with whole breast radiation therapy ; a clinically isolated ibtr ; and treatment for ibtr by mastectomy .
