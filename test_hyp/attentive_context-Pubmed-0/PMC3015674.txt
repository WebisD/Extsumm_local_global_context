a 76-year - old gentleman underwent a pcnl for a 2.2x1.4-cm lower pole calculus via an uneventful upper pole puncture .
percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is a widely accepted treatment for urinary calculi > 2 cm or resistant to other modalities .
thus , we will present the management of a retained council tip catheter after pcnl .
complications of this procedure are well reported ; however , to our knowledge no mention has occurred in the literature of a retained nephrostomy tube after pcnl .
a retained urethral catheter due to balloon malfunction is a well - recognized urologic complication .
pigtail catheters following pcnl may represent a good alternative for drainage and access , while minimizing the risk of catheter malfunction or retention .
tubeless pcnl would avoid these issues entirely ; however , the tubeless technique is contraindicated in the face of significant postoperative bleeding , urinary extravasation , ureteral obstruction , or anticipated need for a second - look nephroscopy .
our familiarity with the use of the chiba needle and 3-dimensional fluoroscopy for percutaneous renal access facilitated percutaneous puncture of the catheter balloon .
many solutions to this problem have been attempted , including overinflation until rupture , puncture of the balloon via a wire through the balloon port , and puncture of the balloon under ultrasound guidance via a suprapubic or transvaginal route . given this infrequent but known complication of balloon - type cystostomy catheters , it is not surprising that a similar complication occurred in our patient .
