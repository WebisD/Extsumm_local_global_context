her elevated -hcg appeared consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome reflected in a decline in -hcg that correlated with a response to treatment .
the patient underwent standard - of - care therapy upfront with progression of disease and was referred to investigational therapeutics for phase i treatment .
when evaluating patients for clinical trial , intrauterine pregnancy is commonly considered an exclusion criteria , however guidelines do not exist to determine what to do should a pregnancy test result as positive .
this is the first case of paraneoplastic -hcg production from an ovarian adenocarcinoma reported in the literature .
a 34-year - old african american female with metastatic mucinous ovarian carcinoma presented with a pelvic mass discovered during her annual gynecological examination .
pelvic ultrasound and -hcg heterophilic antibody testing were negative ruling out intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy or phantom hcg .
paraneoplastic syndrome should remain in the differential diagnosis in patients found to have elevated levels of -hcg without evidence of intra- or extra - uterine pregnancy .
in our case , the patient had a primary ovarian neoplasm with metastases within the abdomen .
we provide a treatment algorithm to evaluate for paraneoplastic hcg production when assessing for clinical trial eligibility ( fig .
