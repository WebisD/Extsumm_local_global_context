an ocular examination may provide clues to the underlying disease , and an awareness of the possibilities of travel - related pathology may shed light on an ocular presentation .
we searched the medline database via pubmed and identified articles by cross - referencing the terms ocular , eye , ophthalmic , retinitis , endophthalmitis , conjunctivitis , and uveitis to specific infectious diseases in adults .
an awareness of these is therefore important to the clinician evaluating this group of patients .  
we searched the cochrane database for systematic reviews on the treatment of specific parasitic ocular infections .
the eye is involved both in a variety of systemic infections and may be the primary focus of other pathologies .
the majority of the clinically important species of parasites involved in eye infections are reviewed in this paper .
additionally , we reviewed texts for completeness and to obtain other references of eye complications of systemic infections ( see tables 7 and 8) .
much debate and confusion have taken place over the type and frequency of ocular examination in patients taking these drugs .   despite improved understanding of the clinical features of inflammatory eye diseases and advances in diagnostic testing , clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for infective parasitic diseases in patients thought to have inflammatory eye involvement .
