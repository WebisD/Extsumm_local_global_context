the exit procedure is a relatively new procedure and holds promise for newborns with airway obstruction .
the exit procedure therefore requires a multidisciplinary team approach , including at least two anesthesiologists for both the mother and the fetus , a pediatric otorhinolaryngologist , an obstetric surgeon , a neonatologist , and a team of nurses . during the exit procedure
the patient was a healthy 29-year - old multigravida . in week 28 , the fetus was found to have an anterior neck mass and polyhydramnios was also detected by prenatal ultrasound . during the last four weeks prior to delivery , the neck mass grew substantially , had a broad base , and was 7 cm in diameter .
anesthesia for the exit procedure can be performed in various ways , as long as uterine relaxation and uteroplacental circulation are maintained until the fetal airway is secured .
preoperative planning and communication with regard to anesthesia are the most important factors for success .
an exit procedure was performed at week 38 of gestation by a multidisciplinary team of experts including a pediatric otorhinolaryngologist , neonatologist , obstetrician , two anesthesiologists , and nurses .
the aim of the exit procedure is to manage life - threatening neonatal emergencies and thereby increase the survival rate at delivery .
