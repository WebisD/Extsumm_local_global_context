the strength of agreement , as proposed by altman ( 28 ) , was moderate for carbohydrates and water ( 0.42 and 0.54 , respectively ) , to fair for protein , fat and alcohol ( 0.29 , 0.36 and 0.31 , respectively ) . for micronutrients ,
negative ratios were found for fibre in the total sample and both genders , for protein and potassium in women only , for simple sugars in men only and for water and riboflavin in the total sample and women only . 
 

agreement for thiamine and calcium was found to be poor ( 0.10 and 0.17 , respectively ) .
group - level intakes of protein , carbohydrates , starch , sugar , water , potassium and calcium from duplicate 24hr do not differ from those obtained by 5-day edrs .
day - to - day variability using statistical models produces comparable means for nutrient intake compared to unadjusted data ; however , the distributions of intakes show smaller standard deviations which in turn decrease the odds of finding a different mean intake between both methods by chance alone . with respect to the positive recall / record ratio of total fat ( 1.26 ) and , by extension , fatty acids and energy
