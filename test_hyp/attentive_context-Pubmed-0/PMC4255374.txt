the aim of this study was detection of hhv-6 dna in csf of patients with symptoms of possible acute encephalitis , using real - time pcr .
in this cross - sectional study , all children aged  2 years with encephalitis - like symptoms ( temperature > 38c , convulsion , and some with altered levels of consciousness ) , admitted to the emergency ward of children medical center of tehran university of medical sciences between march 2010 and march 2011 were enrolled .
we should follow up for identifying the type of viruses ( hhv-6 a or b ) as well as the prevalence of hhv-6 dna integration into the germline , which can permanently turn the individual into hhv-6-positive .
of the 114 children , febrile convulsion ( fc ) was the first episode in 95 ( 83.33% ) and the second in 19 ( 16.66% ) .
the disease incidence was 42.1% in autumn , 35.08% in winter , 17.54% in spring , and 5.26% in summer
dna was found in eight of 95 patients with first fc episode and two of 19 with second episode .
