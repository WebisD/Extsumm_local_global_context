agomelatine may differ from melatonin not only in the absence of mt3 agonism , but also in the presence of a dual antagonism on 5-ht2c and 5-ht2b , which may corroborate the claimed clinical antidepressant effect and account for the increase of the b - wave amplitude and latency of the cones ( in daylight conditions ) .
nonetheless , along with the abovementioned limitations urging much prudence in the interpretation of our results and the acknowledgement that a decline in the central serotonin activity may itself affect the cone b - wave latency , it pays to note that the  classical  paradigm of monoamines ( including dopamine ) as a core pathway involved in depression has been debated , shifting more attention toward impaired circadian rhythms in depression.67 therefore , with the ultimate goal of shedding further light on the mechanism of action of novel antidepressants , with agomelatine being the case in point , additional , more methodologically accurate erg studies on the matter are warranted .
currently , virtually any psychiatric diagnosis is made through a combination of patient interviews , checklists , or self - report questionnaires , which rely on the symptoms coded in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , either the fourth edition1 or the recently introduced fifth edition.2 yet , considerable debate exists about the actual validity of this sole symptom - based approach , thus sustaining the interest in objective biomarkers toward a better understanding of psychiatric disorders , including major depressive disorder ( mdd ) , and their pharmacological response.3 furthermore , a number of issues , including heterogeneous patients variables , high medical and psychiatric comorbidity rates , medications / triggers , inconsistency in specimen collection , storage and measurement protocols , and complexity of neuropsychiatric biological determinants of disorders , hinder the search for reliable biomarkers.4,5 ideally , a hassle - free biomarker reflecting the central nervous system ( cns ) functioning should provide a simplified , yet reliable , proxy measure of the activity of those neurotransmitters that are supposed to be involved in major psychiatric disturbances , to be flexibly applied both to clinical and healthy samples . among other approaches , the electroretinogram ( erg ) represents a relatively noninvasive , short , and cost - effective method developed to investigate the origin of a visual loss due to a retinal disease or injury , possibly representing a proxy of global cns activity of dopamine,6 a core monoamine in depression ,
