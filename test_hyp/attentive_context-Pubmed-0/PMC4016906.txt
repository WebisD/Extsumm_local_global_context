the current study demonstrated that cellular cxcl16 expression was negatively correlated with the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells .
therefore , it is important to get a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis and to develop prognostic and therapeutic strategies . in this study , we explore the expression and function of cxcl16 in breast cancer cell lines that differ in aggressiveness .
we therefore sought to identify a specific function for tm - cxcl16 through in vivo and in vitro breast cancer models . in this study , we show for the first time that upregulation of cxcl16 suppresses migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in vitro and delays progression of tumor growth in vivo .
proliferation was the strongest in mda - mb-231 cells , while sk - br-3 cells and mcf-7 cells possessed less , though equal , proliferative capability ( figure 1(e ) ) . to further confirm the effect of cxcl16 on invasion , migration , and proliferation in these breast cancer cell lines
was known about the functions of tm - cxcl16 except that high expression of cxcl16 in cancer tissues correlated with favorable prognosis in renal and colorectal cancer patients   .
