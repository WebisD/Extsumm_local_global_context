coronary anomalies are reported in 1 to 5% of coronary angiographic examinations ; they are usually asymptomatic , and are discovered accidentally.1 an anomalous origin of the left anterior descending artery ( lad ) from both right and left sinus of valsalva is considered one of the rarest anomalies.27 the following report describes a patient presenting with an acute coronary syndrome , whose coronary angiography revealed an unusual course of the lad from the right and left coronary arteries .
grave surgical complications may occur by cutting an aberrant vessel.3 in conclusion , we presented a rare anatomical variation of the lad , known as a double lad type iv .
the lad arose aberrantly from the right sinus of valsalva and supplied the area abandoned by the main lad .
different types of congenital coronary anomalies have been reported , most of them having been discovered incidentally through routine coronary angiography .
a double lad is among the rarest anomalies and its incidence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03% in different studies.5 in their classification , spindola - franko described four types of double lad8 : type i  iii arises from the left side , and the last type ( apparently the rarest ) emerges from the right coronary sinus . here
