the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between obesity and these cytokine / chemokine / metabolic hormones in chimpanzees .
for example , the levels of circulating fibrinogen and other acute phase reactants , including tnf , il-6 , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) were found to be elevated in obesity   . in the present study we investigated the relationship between cytokines and obesity by measuring plasma concentrations of different cytokines and metabolic hormones in lean , overweight , and obese chimpanzees . furthermore , we also examined the influence of obesity on immune function .
in the present study , we compared the circulating plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines , anti - inflammatory cytokines , growth factors , and metabolic hormones in lean , overweight , and obese chimpanzees .
the study of obese chimpanzees could both help in the management of this species and also lend clues to the human obesity epidemic . in the present study , we examined cytokine , chemokine , and metabolic hormones levels in plasma of three chimpanzee weight categories ; lean , overweight , and obese .
we also studied the immune responses of lean , overweight , and obese chimpanzees to test the hypothesis that obesity is associated with an impaired immune function and deregulated inflammatory response . in vitro proliferative responses of pbmcs and the production of ifn-
