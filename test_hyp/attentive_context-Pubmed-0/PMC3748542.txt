this paper reports a qualitative study of the maternal experiences from the perspective of first - time mothers in the current social and cultural environment of iran .
in this qualitative study , one - to - one interviews with a semi - structured in - depth interview schedule were used to shed light upon the experiences of first - time mothers in their maternal role adaptation .
findings of this research , therefore , do not reflect maternal experiences of all ethnic groups living in iran . despite the existing restrictions , this study attempts to present a proper description of view points and experiences of today 's iranian first - time mothers . according to the present research findings , experiences of iranian first - time mothers in dealing with challenges and strains of maternal role adaptation have a lot in common with counterpart studies that have been mainly conducted in western countries .
what is evident is that the discrepancies between subjective expectations and postnatal experiences take an influential part in causing these problems .
, the embedded resemblance of these experiences despite social , cultural , and geographic differences admits the existence of shared factors in creating the aforementioned crisis , which calls for additional research so as to provide awareness and proper outlooks toward such experiences among different groups of people around the world .
