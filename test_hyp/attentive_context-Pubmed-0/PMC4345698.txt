the mitral valve is located far from midline sternotomy , but is very close to the interatrial groove .
as our experience grew and we learned from embryology , we found that a more cental left atriotomy was advantageous , and possible by interatrial groove dissection using ultrasonic scalpel .
because the mitral valve is such a complex anatomic structure and the maneuvers involved in correcting a regurgitant valve may vary from the simple to the very complex , adequate exposure is an absolute requirement in every operative plan .
the dissection is carried out in the exact groove of sondergaard until accessing beneath the thin atrial septum with careful attention paid to the coronary sinus vein ( fig .
the first critical step to standard valve repair is the complete and thorough development of the sondergaard plane reflecting the right atrium off the left atrium to the atrial septum .
this was first described in the 1950s by the danish surgeon sondergaard to expose the atrial septum for noncardiopulmonary bypass treatment of atrial septal defects .
the fad pad covering the interatrial groove is dissected under cardiopulmonary bypass by ultrasonic scalpel .
we have been adopting this incision and approach in 10 consecutive patients and have found that the aortic cross - clamp time decreased significantly from an average 75 minutes to 48 minutes compared to right - side left atriotomy patients . a more central incision onto the left atrium
