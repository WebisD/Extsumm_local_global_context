to evaluate the effects of the quality of the bone bed on the primary stability of the implant , two different artificial bone blocks similar to d1 and d3 bone types were prepared .
the difference in primary stability , which was affected by application of narrow platform implants , was more prominent in low bone quality rp and wp implants did not have any significant influence in terms of implant primary stability .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of implant length and diameter on primary implant stability in different bone types , based on resonance frequency analysis through in vitro conditions to avoid the effects of other intermediary factors .
implant length was a determining factor to achieve more primary stability in low bone quality .
within the limitation of the current in vitro study it can be concluded that implant primary stability was higher in high bone quality .
a number of 60 nobel biocare replace select tiunit tapered implants with two different lengths ( 10 mm and 13 mm ) and three different widths of 3.4 mm ( narrow platform ( np ) ) , 4.3 mm ( regular platform ( rp ) ) and 5 mm ( wide platform ( wp ) ) were utilized for primary stability evaluation .
