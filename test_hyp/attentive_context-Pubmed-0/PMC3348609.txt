although specific determination of the fr91 metabolic action in the colitis prevention and treatment will require further investigations , we showed that fr91 prevented ulcerative lesions in mice models of colitis , inhibiting the development of colorectal tumors .
levels of expression of il-23 and il-17 are increased in patients with active ibd .  
furthermore , we investigated if the chronic phase was characterized by a regulation in the expression of apoptotic genes and by a dysregulation of t helper 1 ( th1)/t helper 2 ( th2 ) balance and how this would relate to mucosal regeneration .
, we induced a wide range of colorectal lesions to better evaluate the effects of an anticancer agent ( fr91 ) on chronic ulcerative colitis in mice .
, we investigated the effect of fr91 , a standardized lysate of microbial cells belonging to the bacillus genus which has been previously shown to have significant immunomodulatory effects tested on human tumor cell lines , on colonic inflammation induced by 8-week exposure of 2% dss in the drinking water and , in particular , whether fr91 affects colorectal inflammation .
the present study aimed to investigate the effect of fr-91 on the attenuation of the chronic experimental colitis induced by dss in swiss mice .
