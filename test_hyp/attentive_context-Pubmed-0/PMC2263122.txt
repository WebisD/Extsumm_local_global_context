notch proteins are evolutionarily conserved cell - surface receptors for transmembrane ligands of the dsl family ( named after the delta and serrate ligands of drosophila ) . signaling by notch regulates a broad range of cell - fate decisions during development and various human diseases , including cancers ,
these include roles in the folding of notch in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , in notch - ligand binding and in endocytic trafficking of notch .

although the catalytic and non - catalytic activities of ofut1 can be experimentally uncoupled , it is attractive to speculate that the o - fucosylation activity of ofut1 participates in the quality - control mechanism that ensures that only properly folded notch exits the er . further analysis of the trafficking of non - fucosylated notch , produced for instance by gmd mutant cells , would help address this issue .
it is clear that the o - fucosylation of notch is primarily required for fringe - dependent signaling events and that ofut1 acts non - catalytically to regulate the exit of notch from the er . thus , ofut1 probably acts as a chaperone in the er to promote the proper folding of the extracellular domain of notch , as described in model 1 .
