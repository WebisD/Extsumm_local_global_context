our attention was then directed towards the preparation and the formulation of a pegylated archaeal tetraether lipid ( peg45-tetraether ) to provide neutral coated archaeosomes valuable as peptide nanocarriers . in order to assess the value of   this new family of stealth liposomes , physicochemical characteristics ( dls , cryo - tem , and hptlc ) , dye encapsulation and release profile for a pegylated archaeosome formulation were determined and compared to those measured from a conventional pegylated liposome formulation .
following such a fundamental work , we have recently evaluated the encapsulation of a therapeutic peptide ( anticancer ) extracted from marine resources into pegylated archaeosomes and the in   vivo efficiency of this peptide - loaded formulation .
our next objective was to evaluate the potential applications of archaeosome technology for the delivery of additional hydrophilic substrates such as antitumoral peptides ( project sealacian : encapsulation of natural marine peptides , extracted from scyliorhinus   canicula , for their site - specific delivery ) .
in conclusion , we have demonstrated that small proportions of a novel synthetic pegylated archaeolipid added to a liposomal formulation increase significantly the nanovector stability and slow down the constant dye release at 37c .
