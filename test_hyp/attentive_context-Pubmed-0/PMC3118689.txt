ag - nps have been successfully prepared in castor oil by laser ablation from a silver plate . the results obtained showed that the produced ag - nps were well dispersed and also stable for quite a long period of time .
fabrication of ag - nps in castor oil using laser ablation has not been reported previously .
, we report fabrication of ag - nps in castor oil . to the best of our knowledge ,
the ultraviolet - visible spectrum of the ag - nps in castor oil was measured after a period of 2 months in order to check the ability of castor oil as a stabilizer . as shown in figure 2b
this ability of castor oil to prevent agglomeration of ag - nps is due to the presence of long - chain hydrophobic moieties .
the appearance of the maximum absorption peak around 400 nm confirms that the solution contained ag - nps , and that this peak originated from the oscillation of collection of free conduction electrons of ag - nps , which is called surface plasmon resonance .
we believe that the existence of ag - nps prevents intermolecular hydrogen bonding , and therefore , the vibrational stretching modes of free o  h appear at a higher wave number.15
