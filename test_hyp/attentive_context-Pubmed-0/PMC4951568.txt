, this case indicates a possible link between wilson 's disease and hypopituitarism presenting as altered thyroid homeostasis and pituitary - adrenal axis dysfunction .

dysfunction and wilson 's disease , a case of delayed puberty in an 18-year - old male with wilson 's disease was reported , suggesting copper accumulation as the potential cause of decreased synthesis or secretion of gnrh in the hypothalamus or pituitary . like in our study , the brain mri was negative of any pituitary lesion ( 11 ) .
