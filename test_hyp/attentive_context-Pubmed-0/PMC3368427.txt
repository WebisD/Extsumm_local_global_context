the purpose of this study was firstly , to monitor overweight 15-year olds ' self - perceived weight from 1994 to 2010 and determine the prevalence of body dissatisfaction and secondly , to survey the prevalence of weight control behaviour ( i.e. , attempts to lose weight and use of specific weight control practices ) in the same group during the 2000s in finland .
findings revealed apparent gender differences in self - perception of weight , body dissatisfaction , and in engagement in weight control behaviour among overweight adolescents .
results of this study demonstrated not only the self - reported overweight in finnish 15-year olds , but also that the majority of overweight adolescents were aware of their weight status .
the current study monitored the prevalence rates of self - perceived weight and weight control behaviour among overweight adolescents in finland .
due to low number of cases in the obesity group , we combined the preobese and obese cases and refer to them as overweight in the later text .
the mean values of emotional investment in the body ( bis ) scores were statistically significantly lower in overweight adolescents than in nonoverweight adolescents in both genders and in both 2006 and 2010 surveys ( table 4 ) .
