, cnvs are highlighting the shared genetic susceptibility for a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions .
both recurrent and non - recurrent cnvs have been identified in most major classes of epilepsy . in some cases
finally , as patients with shared genetic etiologies of epilepsy are identified , studies of genotype  phenotype correlation , natural history , and therapeutic response to specific anti - epileptic drugs can be performed , which will lead to improved long - term care and outcomes for patients .
it is clear that the identification of disease - associated cnvs will lead to improved diagnosis and prognosis counseling .

 epilepsy is a group of conditions characterized by recurrent , unprovoked seizures that result from abnormal synchronized neuronal firing in the brain .
three broad classes of epilepsy include genetic generalized epilepsy ( gge ; formerly idiopathic generalized epilepsy ) , focal epilepsy , and epileptic encephalopathy , though it should be noted that there are many specific epilepsy syndromes within each class ( table  1 ) .
