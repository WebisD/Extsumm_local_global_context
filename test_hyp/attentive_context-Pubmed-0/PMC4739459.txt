recent studies have revealed many aspects of the complex and important role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
atherosclerosis - related diseases and cancer are the two greatest contributors to the overall mortality in the developed countries   . given that these diseases are tightly associated with immunopathology , development of comprehensive diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches to modulate the immune system appears to be of the greatest importance .
alterations in monocyte activation and imbalance in macrophage polarization can be associated with a variety of pathological conditions , including different types of cancer and atherosclerosis .
correspondingly , anti - inflammatory agents are considered as an important component of antiatherosclerotic therapy . here again , the analysis of macrophage phenotypic diversity could improve the understanding of the pathological process and assessment of the therapy efficiency . according to current epidemiological data ,
in that regard , comprehensive analysis of the macrophage population diversity would be necessary for developing adequate therapeutic approaches and monitoring the therapy efficiency .
it was proven to be suitable for the analysis of immunopathology in subclinical atherosclerosis and breast cancer .
it is clear that changes in cytokine expression and phenotypic features of macrophages may reflect the disease progression state .
