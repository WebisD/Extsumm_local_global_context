we report a case of cecal perforation , in a 70 year old female , following colonoscopic polypectomy that was treated successfully with laparoscopic application of an endo - gia linear stapler .
four months following staple resection of her cecal perforation , the patient is asymptomatic and has undergone a repeat colonoscopy without any sequelae .
the unfortunate complication of a colotomy resulting from a colonoscopic polypectomy can be disastrous . using the versatility of laparoscopic surgery
laparoscopic techniques can be safely applied in the treatment of colonic perforations following therapeutic polypectomies .
a suggested management algorithm is provided highlighting the role laparoscopy may provide in selected patients .
presented here , we modified the established technique of laparoscopic appendectomy to the specific problem of cecal perforation and have demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach .
many general surgeons will be confronted with the problem of colon perforation during colonoscopy . in the case
several case reports advocating laparoscopic repair of colonic perforation following colonoscopy have been described in the literature . in our present case report
conceptually , it seems there is little harm in starting with a diagnostic laparoscopy and proceeding based on the nature of the injury and the experience of the surgeon .
