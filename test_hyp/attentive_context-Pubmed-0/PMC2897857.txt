considering the high number of in vitro techniques proposed over the years , a model with a main and various lateral canals would be an important tool with which to investigate and compare filling techniques.11 the purpose of this study is to compare the ability of three filling techniques to fill simulated lateral canals ( continuous wave of condensation , thermomechanical compaction , and lateral condensation ) and , also , compare the percentage of lateral canals filled by gutta - percha and sealer .
groups 1 and 2 had the largest linear measure percentage of lateral canals filled ( gutta - percha and sealer ) and were statistically different from group 3 ( p<.01 ) .
group 2 had the largest linear measure percentage of simulated lateral canals filled with gutta - percha and sealer ( p<.05 ) .
groups 1 and 2 had 91.26% and 95.93% of the extension of lateral canals filled with gutta - percha and sealer , respectively .
no statistical differences were found between group 1 and group 2 when we analyzed the filling with gutta - percha and sealer or just sealer ( p>.05 ) .
the teeth in group 1 ( continuous wave of condensation ) had the largest number of filled lateral canals in the radiographic analysis , followed by group 2 ( thermomechanical technique ) and group 3 ( lateral condensation ) ( table 1 ) .
