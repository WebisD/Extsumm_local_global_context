the presented case is a diffuse large b - cell lymphoma expressing cd30 positivity . to the best of our knowledge
a 60-year - old male patient was referred to an otorhinolaryngology clinic due to a lump on the left side of his jaw , which had grown in 2 months .
, the patient was diagnosed with " wt and cd30 positive diffuse large b - cell lymphoma in the parotid gland . " following the lymphoma diagnosis , a full body screen was performed .
wt is the second most common type of salivary gland tumor . in 10 - 15% of cases , it is bilateral , and it accounts for 70% of all bilateral salivary gland tumors.2 the male / female ratio is 1.6/1 , and it typically develops in the 6th and 7th decades . smoking increases the risk of developing wt.5 microscopically the tumors are typically composed of proliferative epithelial components accompanied by lymphoid stroma with lymphoid follicles that have distinct germinal centers .
this is the first case in literature describing dlbcl with expression of cd30 in wt .
histogenesis of the lymphoid stroma in wt has been a topic of discussion for many years .
