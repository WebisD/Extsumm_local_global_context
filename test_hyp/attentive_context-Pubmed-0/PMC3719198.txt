the aim of the present work is to clarify the nomenclatural and taxonomic status of cintractia carpophila var .
kenaica , and to provide a detailed characterization of this smut fungus as it lacks a detailed description and any iconography .
host plants of these anthracoidea species are placed in one of the four / five major clades of the tribe cariceae , the so called  core unispicate clade  , which includes carex subgen .
( 2005 ) , the only accessioned smooth - spored species , a. elynae , was recovered as sister to the verrucose - spored species a. curvulae on carex curvula , which is also a member of the  core unispicate clade  .
such historical names should be critically re - examined in addition to any comprehensive molecular studies directed to the description of novel anthracoidea species .
leiosporae support a. kenaica as a distinct species specialised to a host in carex sect .
kenaica is such a neglected taxon name and a likely candidate to be a distinct member of anthracoidea .
differences between smut specimens in the ovaries of carex micropoda and all aforementioned anthracoidea species from sect .
detailed morphological characteristics of the holotype , isotype , and two non - type specimens of cintractia carpophila var .
