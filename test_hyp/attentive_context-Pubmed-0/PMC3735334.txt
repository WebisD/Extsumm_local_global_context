rotating camera scheimpflug imagery ( pentacam , oculus optikgerte gmbh , wetzlar , germany ) , provides a multitude of corneal refractive ( keratometric ) , topometric , tomographic , and pachymetric data.11,12 in addition , specific anterior - surface irregularity indices have been developed for the grading and classification of keratoconus development , as well as the post - operative assessment.1319 the aim of this study was to investigate the values of these indices , the repeatability of their measurement , and their correlation with best spectacle - corrected distance visual acuity ( cdva ) , keratometry , and commonly used keratoconus classification in a large pool of clinically diagnosed keratoconic eyes .
