in recognition of the progressive nature of t2 dm , the current korean clinical practice guidelines ( korean diabetes association ) suggest a stepped interventional approach .
more data are needed to examine efficacy , safety , and optimal dosing of glp-1ras in korean patients with t2 dm . however , based on the data currently available , their use is appropriate in several patient groups , including patients whose hba1c is uncontrolled , especially if this is due to postprandial glucose excursions and patients who are overweight or obese due to dietary problems ( e.g. , appetite control ) .
we review recent data on glp-1ras to help better understand their current risk / benefit profile and provide primary care practitioners with guidance on how this evidence can inform their clinical practice .
glucagon - like peptide-1 receptor agonists ( glp-1ras ) are recognized as providing a moderate ( 0.5% to 1.0% ) reduction in hba1c , with no hypoglycemia and no weight gain . however , there are some concerns with respect to gastrointestinal ( gi ) side effects and the lack of long - term established safety profile . in this paper
type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) has become a worldwide epidemic . it is estimated that 60% of the world 's diabetic population is in asia .
