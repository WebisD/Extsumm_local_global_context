retinal vascular geometry parameters , specifically retinal venular ldr and tortuosity , are independent predictors of incident renal dysfunction in young people with type 1 diabetes .
in this longitudinal study of young people with type 1 diabetes , normal aer , and no retinopathy at baseline , greater retinal venular ldr and lower venular tortuosity predicted incident renal dysfunction independent of established risk factors including diabetes duration , glycemic control , bp , and total cholesterol .
no significant differences were observed with respect to sex distribution , diabetes duration , bp sds , bmi sds , insulin therapy intensity , or glycemic control ( a1c ) between these groups ( table 1 ) . a greater proportion of those who developed incident renal dysfunction also developed incident retinopathy ( p < 0.001 ) .
a : cumulative hazard curves for risk of early renal dysfunction by ldrv quartiles : quartile 4 vs. quartiles 13 ( hr 2.0 [ 95% ci 1.32.9 ] ) adjusted for sex , a1c , and dbp sds .
our study highlights the role of venular ldr and tortuosity as tools for risk stratification of individuals at high risk for microvascular complications , and in monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic benefits .
