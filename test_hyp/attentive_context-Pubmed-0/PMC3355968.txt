recent advances in signal transduction studies have identified many key oncogenic kinases and their substrates in cancer progression , and the signaling pathways associated with these kinases have been recognized as promising drug targets .
therefore , in order to develop effective personalized cancer therapy , it would be essential that we understand the cross - talk among the multiple oncogenic signaling pathways . in this review , we introduced akt , erk , and ikk as the key survival kinases for cancer progression and survival .
in order to maintain cellular homeostasis , the amount of proteins in cells is selectively controlled not only in protein synthesis but also in protein degradation . the ubiquitin  proteasome pathway is essential for multiple physiological systems via selective degradation of target proteins ( hershko and ciechanover , 1998 ) .
, bortezomib is a specific proteasome inhibitor that is currently used for the treatment of multiple myeloma .
we also introduce some examples of the signaling pathways that are controlled via the ubiquitin  proteasome system , which seems to play an essential role in signaling pathway like phosphorylation . as we described above , inhibition of protein ubiquitination
although the detailed mechanisms underlying drug resistance are not fully understood , there is evidence to support that alternative pathways are being activated in resistant cells to compensate for the survival signal blocked by targeting agents .
