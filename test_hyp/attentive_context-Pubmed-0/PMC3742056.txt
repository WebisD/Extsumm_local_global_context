using in vivo time - lapse confocal and two - photon imaging of the visual center optic tectum in living larval zebrafish , we first monitored changes in the morphology of microglia under resting state .
considering the bi - directional modulation between neurons and microglia , this study also represents a new perspective in understanding the physiological function of resting microglia .
considering the bi - directional modulation between neurons and microglia , this study also represents a new perspective in understanding the physiological function of resting microglia .
collectively , our work brings forth and demonstrates a novel reciprocal regulation between resting microglia and neurons in vivo .
thus , our study reveals a functional regulation of neuronal activity by resting microglia under physiological conditions , offering a new way for homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity .
, we further proved that neural activity plays an instructive role in steering the motility of resting microglial processes and the formation of microglia - neuron contact . using glutamate uncaging , we locally upregulated neuronal activity in a small brain region of the intact zebrafish larvae .
thus , our study reveals a functional regulation of neuronal activity by resting microglia under physiological conditions , offering a new way for homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity .
