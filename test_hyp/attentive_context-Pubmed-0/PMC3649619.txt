this is the first reported case of bilateral crescent fractures , and the first reported case of pelvic fracture as a result of this mechanism of injury .
pelvic insufficiency fractures are relatively common and should be suspected in older female patients with unexplained hip , groin , buttock , low back pain and/or difficulty with ambulation , particularly if there is any recent history of trauma ( 10 ) . while the majority of these insufficiency fractures may be treated conservatively our patient required surgical fixation due to the unstable nature of her injury . to our knowledge this is the first reported case of bilateral crescent fractures and also of a pelvic fracture occurring as a result of this unique mechanism of injury .
pelvic fractures and in particular crescent fracture dislocations , which are characterised by disruption of the sacroiliac joint with extension proximally as a fracture of the posterior iliac wing , usually occur as a result of high velocity trauma ( 1,2 ) .
less invasive techniques are beneficial in this older population ( 3 ) . the unique fracture pattern described in this report occurred as a result of the patient falling in such a way as to result in simultaneous sudden flexion of one hip with extension of the contra - lateral hip , into a position known in athletic terms as the front splits . the combination of the torque force produced by the fall and the patients reduced bone mineral density resulted in a unique , unstable pelvic fracture . to our knowledge
