although th17 is a welcome addition to our understanding of immune - mediated tissue damage , we still need the th1/th2 axis and other inflammatory mediators to explain many aspects of human autoimmune , allergic , and infectious diseases .
in our rush to embrace th17 cells as the purveyors of tissue damage , we should not forget that cytokines produced by th1 cells and other cell types are critical in promoting various forms of inflammation .
ex vivo studies have also suggested that cytokines of the th1/th2 axis are critical determinants in mycobacterial diseases ranging from tuberculoid leprosy , which is primarily driven by il-12 and th1 cells , to lepromatous leprosy , which is mediated by th2 cells ( 17 ) . and
in a recent issue of the jem , luger et al . ( 7 ) demonstrated that il-17 and il-23 , a cytokine that drives expansion of th17 cells , are important in the pathogenesis of eau , a model that reflects many aspects of both infectious and autoimmune uveitis in man . in that study ,
administration of ifn- , for example , worsened disease in patients with ms ( 13 ) . and blocking tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , which can be produced by various cell types , is a gold standard for treatment of diseases now thought to be driven largely by th17 cells , including ra , crohn 's disease , and various forms of psoriasis ( 1 ) .
