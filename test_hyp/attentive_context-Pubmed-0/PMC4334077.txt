2014 ) . specifically , we measured concentrations of cd , pb , cu , and zn in liver and kidney of wild beavers . we predicted ( i ) metal concentrations to differ between liver and kidney according to element - specific metabolism , ( ii ) no sexual difference in metal concentrations in this non - dimorphic species , and ( iii ) higher metal concentrations in adult than in juvenile individuals because of bioaccumulation processes .
our aim was to use the eurasian beaver as a bioindicator organism ( i ) to assess trace element contents in a region away from major industrial centers and ( ii ) to evaluate the degree of contamination against legal cd and pb levels recommended by the european commission in farm animal edible tissues ( european commission 2006 ) with regard to the lack of an official threshold for wildlife ( giejewska et al .
our study revealed the presence of cd , pb , cu , and zn in liver and kidney of all sampled beavers . no relationship was observed between metal concentrations and the beavers sex .
the fact that cd concentrations in adult beavers exceeded limits recommended in farm animal tissues warrants caution .
