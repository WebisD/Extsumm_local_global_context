photodynamic therapy using 
 gold nanoparticles will also require careful design of the nanoparticles 
 with respect to size , shape , and capping layer and will require internalization 
 of the nps , not just attachment to the cell surface , which is sufficient 
 for photothermal therapy .
here we present new experimental results on the photogeneration 
 of singlet oxygen by irradiation of gold nanoparticles with continuous or pulsed laser light , as well as theoretical work pertaining 
 to the underlying mechanism(s ) , which so far had not been addressed . 

dpbf has been used successfully to detect 
 singlet oxygen that is 
 formed when spherical nps are irradiated at 532 nm , either with cw 
 or pulsed laser irradiation .
irradiation of gold nps with continuous wave ( cw ) lamp or laser 
 light has been shown to lead to photogeneration of singlet oxygen 
 ( o2 ) in vitro , suggesting that this highly reactive species , which is widely used 
 in photodynamic therapy , may be involved in 
 the photochemical pathway of cell killing by gold nps . in 
 vitroo2
nevertheless , even cw irradiation can produce enough singlet oxygen 
 for photodynamic therapy applications and will allow practical applications 
 of the effect at safe irradiation levels .
