therefore , the purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm for quantitative image analysis for the detection of motion artefacts in coronary artery computed tomography as an added value to the qualitative analysis and test it in phantom scans of two different ct devices .
these artefacts could lead to misinterpretation in the coronary computed tomography angiography ( cta ) analysis .
therefore , only the severe myocardium artefacts can be related to the qualitative analysis.smoothness of vessel centreline pathway along z - axisthe second derivatives of all heart rates have small absolute values below 1.5 indicating that no large discontinuities at the vessel pathway occurred and a student s t test comparing the second derivatives of all heart rates to 0  bpm showed no significant differences ( p  <  0.05 ) .
multi detector computed tomography ( mdct ) , a non - invasive imaging modality featuring large scan coverage up to 320 detector system rows , sub - millimetre spatial resolution up to 0.23  mm , and high temporal resolution up to 135  ms for a single source ct and 75  ms for a dual source ct ( dsct ) system ( with options for further increase using multi - segmental reconstruction techniques ) , is the current preferred method for cad assessment   . because of patient movement , irregular heart rate , and insufficient temporal resolution for high heart rate , cardiac mdct images are often hampered by motion artefacts .
