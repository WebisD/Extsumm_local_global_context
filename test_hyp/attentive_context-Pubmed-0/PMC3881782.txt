in addition , the opportunity was taken to assess 
 the effect of the association of epiphany primer and ah plus / gutta - percha on apical 
 sealing and gap formation .
the aim of this study was to compare the apical sealing and gap formation of ah 
 plus / gutta - percha with epiphany system .
correspondence analysis of microleakage vs. type of gap : ( inf.0 ) - absence of 
 leakage ; ( inf.1 ) - leakage up to the 1 millimeter ; ( inf.2 ) 
the adjusted model demonstrated that the effect of the type of gap 
 on the logit of microleakage is significant when compared to the 
 presence of types 1 and 2 ( figure 2b and 2c , respectively ) of gap with the absence of gap 
 ( p=0.047 ) .
the presence 
 of gaps had an effect on apical microleakage for all materials . comparing the materials , 
 epiphany system presented more regions containing gaps between the dentin and the sealer 
 ( type 1 ) . in view of these findings ,
leakage 
 up to the 2 mm ; ( inf.3 )  leakage up to the 3 
 millimeter ; ( inf.5 )  leakage up to the 5 millimeter ; ( f.0 )  absence 
 of gaps ; ( f.1 )  gaps type 1 ; ( f.2 ) - gaps types 1 and 2 .
