we also review the mutations of the sodium channel 1 subunit gene that were identified in the turkish population .
dravet syndrome , or severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy , is a rare form of epilepsy which is characterized by impaired psychomotor and neurologic development , occurring in the first year of life in an apparently normal infant .
a family history of febrile seizure and epilepsy is present in2054% of patients with dravet syndrome .
taken together , the diagnosis of dravet syndrome is easier in patients presenting with typical clinical findings , but the diagnosis is difficult in patients whose seizures are atypical and/or the psychomotor development is normal .
defining the clinical and genetic features of more cases with dravet syndrome should provide new insights for the disease .
dravet syndrome is a distinct epileptic syndrome characterized by frequent seizures and impaired neurologic and psychomotor development beginning in the first year of life .
the clinical and electroencephalography criteria for diagnosing dravet syndrome include ( 1 ) high frequency of familial seizures ; ( 2 ) normal developmental skills before onset ; ( 3 ) generalized , unilateral , or alternating unilateral febrile and afebrile clonic seizures beginning in the first year of life , with subsequent myoclonic and partial seizures ; ( 4 ) normal electroencephalography at onset , with later generalized spike - wave and polyspike wave discharges , focal abnormalities and photosensitivity ; ( 5 ) delayed developmental skills from the second year of life onward ; ( 6 ) refractoriness of seizures to antiepileptic drugs . some patients do not have myoclonic and atypical absences and they are accepted as borderline dravet patients . here , we report two patients with dravet syndrome in whom different mutations were identified in the sodium channel 1 subunit gene .
