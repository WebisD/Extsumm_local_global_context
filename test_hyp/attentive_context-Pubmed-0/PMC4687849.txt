the bidentate 
 coordination available to the organometallic / lewis acid is not sufficient 
 to explain the results , as evidenced by the poor reactivity of the 
 methoxyethyl peroxide .
however , whereas the transfer of lio from lithiated hydroperoxides 
 to organolithium reagents has been calculated to involve in - line arrangement 
 of the carbanion , the lithiated oxygen , and the departing oxygen , our calculations suggest side - on insertion 
 of the rli into the lewis acid activated o  o bond .
, we discovered that tetrahydropyranyl 
 ( thp ) monoperoxyacetals selectively transfer the attached or to lithiated 
 1,3-dithianes .
calculations predict , and experiments confirm , that 
 the presence of the acetal group significantly lowers the energy for 
 insertion of unstabilized organometallics and directs the reaction 
 toward exclusive transfer of the nonanomeric oxygen .
we now describe investigations 
 of reactions between carbanions and several classes of organic peroxides , 
 with an emphasis on monoperoxyacetals .
however , the interaction of lewis acids with 
 peroxyacetals and ozonides ( 1,2,4-trioxolanes ) has been previously 
 demonstrated to activate both c  o and o  o bonds . in conclusion , we have shown that monoperoxyacetals , 
 readily prepared 
 and easily handled derivatives of hydroperoxides , enable highly efficient 
 intermolecular transfer of alkoxide to unstabilized organolithium 
 and organomagnesium reagents along with some inductively stabilized 
 organolithium species .
