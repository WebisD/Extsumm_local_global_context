this analysis of patients with tkr showed that those with maw had a greater burden of health care resource use and costs as compared with patients without maw .
the timing of the first maw diagnosis recorded before or after the tkr surgery was also explored to assess its association with patient demographic , clinical , and economic characteristics .
the retrospective , naturalistic study described here was designed to begin to quantify the burden of maw among tkr patients . to this end , the main study objective was to examine differences of direct health care related costs and utilization in tkr patients between those with and without a diagnosis of maw .
specifically , compared with the no maw patients , the post - maw patients had a 44% higher likelihood of being rehospitalized for any cause ( or = 1.44 ; 95% ci : 1.321.57 ) and a 110% higher likelihood of a replacement - related rehospitalization ( or = 2.10 ; 95% ci : 1.702.60 ) among the commercial population .
strategies targeting these high - cost patients may be considered to lessen the economic burden associated with this patient population .
similarly , medicare patients in the post - maw cohort were found to be 1.79 times more likely to be rehospitalized for any cause ( or = 1.79 ; 95% ci : 1.621.97 ) and 2.06 times more likely to have a replacement - related rehospitalization ( or = 2.06 ; 95% ci : 1.432.97 ) compared with those in the no maw cohort .
