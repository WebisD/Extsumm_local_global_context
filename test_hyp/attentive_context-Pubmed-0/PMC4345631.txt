this study provides class iv evidence that for patients with pms , rituximab provided via an ommaya reservoir depletes peripheral blood b lymphocytes .
in whom the initial cell counts were slightly elevated , the same pattern of depletion was seen in the csf as in pb : an immediate drop in both b lymphocytes and total cd45 lymphocytes ( figure 3 ) .
furthermore , it was shown that it administration of anti - cd20 monoclonal antibody could reduce the amount of b lymphocytes in the meninges in eae with a concomitant modest amelioration of the clinical course .
the full dose ( 3  25 mg given 1 week apart ) resulted in complete depletion of peripheral b lymphocytes for 36 months and an initial reduction of total cd45 lymphocytes ( figure 2 ) .
one day after the first dose ( 1 mg ) , peripheral b lymphocytes were clearly depleted , and after the second day 's dose ( 2.5 mg ) , peripheral b lymphocytes were virtually undetectable ( figure 1a ) .
b - lymphocyte ( cd19 ; a ) and total lymphocyte ( cd45 ; b ) counts ( cells/l ) in peripheral blood for 1 year posttreatment ( n = 10 ) .
