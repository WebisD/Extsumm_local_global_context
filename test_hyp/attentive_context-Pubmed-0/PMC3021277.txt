the study presented was undertaken to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of embx and transvaginal ultrasound tvs for detection of intracavitary uterine lesions compared with results of office hysteroscopy ( oh ) , which were taken as the gold standard .
this is especially true when considering the 35 - 50 years age group who present with heavy regular bleeding , clinically enlarged uteri and significant anemia .
the relatively poor sensitivity of both endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound in the detection of intrauterine focal pathology encourage us to propose that oh be utilized as a first line investigation in these patient evaluations . the cost - benefit analysis of investigations like embx and tvs as well as the financial burden of clinic visits during the entire evaluatory process
while the risk of such an occurrence is high in a subset of patients , i.e. postmenopausal women with abnormal bleeding ( 10% ) , anovulatory patients and those with a history of prior endometrial hyperplasia , the yield of endometrial sampling from the rest of the patient population in terms of obtaining a pathological diagnosis is negligible .
, a balance has to be achieved between the practice of  blanket  medicine aiming at performance of all investigations possibly contributing to a diagnosis versus a condition appropriate approach .
