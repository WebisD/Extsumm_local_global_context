over the last two decades , the biological preeminence of cellular nitric oxide ( no ) signaling pathways has been intimately linked to many processes and to its regulated enzymatic formation from l - arginine via the actions of no synthases ( nos ) and to secondary activation of soluble guanylate cyclase as a major physiological target / effector system   . evolutionary pressure has established a functional diversity in cellular expression of nos isoenzymes derived from three distinct genes and designated as endothelial ( e ) , neuronal ( n ) and inducible ( i ) nos .
an important body of work has challenged the primacy of nos / l - arginine derived no in cellular signaling processes and involves the existence of chemically stable nitrite and nitrite reductase activities in these same cell / tissue types   .
finally , holistic pre - clinical and studies to evaluate conversion of dietary nitrate to recycling active cellular nitrite pools hold great promise for improving quality of life in human and animal populations .
nitrite is a major metabolic product of no and is found in all cell and tissue types that utilize no signaling processes   .
on a functional basis it has become clear that the basal level of no derived from cnos in concert with cellular nitrite reduction by xor within a diverse class of nitrite reductases may serve as a key regulatory mechanism underlying complex , cascading , physiological processes associated with maintaining cellular and organ viability .
