the 
 present study was designed to determine the plasma level of orexin and its relationship with 
 other metabolic and anthropometric markers in obese children .
table 3table 3 correlation between anthropometric indices and plasma level of orexin - a or 
 leptin in obese children ( n=47 ) summarizes relationships between the anthropometric indices and the plasma 
 level of orexin - a or leptin in obese children . the plasma orexin - a level was correlated 
 significantly with the waist - to - hip ratio only , while the leptin level was correlated with 
 percentage overweight , waist circumference and percentage body fat . the relationship between 
 plasma levels of orexin - a and leptin
plasma 
 orexin - a concentration was higher in obese children ( 17.0  0.4 pg / ml ; p<0.001 ) than in 
 the control children ( 13.5  1.1 pg / ml ) ( fig . 

obese vs. control : p<0.001 
 for both indices . ) . similarly , plasma leptin concentration was higher in obese children ( 12.0  1.0 
 ng / ml ; p<0.001 ) than in the control children ( 5.2  0.4 ng / ml ) ( fig .
