because the clinicopathological and mri findings of myoepithelioma of the apg have not yet been fully described , and given the rarity of this condition , we hereby describe the clinicopathological and mri findings of an epithelioid myoepithelioma of the apg that was treated in our hospital .
although myoepithelioma of the salivary gland originates most frequently in the parotid gland , myoepithelioma of the accessory parotid gland ( apg ) is extremely rare , and to date , only 5 cases have been reported in the english literature   .
a 31-year - old woman presented with a 5-year history of a slowly enlarging left mid - cheek mass in the pre - parotid region . upon examination , a mobile non - tender and smooth - surfaced mass measuring 20 mm in the greatest dimension was noted in the left pre - parotid region .
myoepithelioma is a benign tumor that can originate from any secretory system throughout the body . in the salivary gland , myoepithelioma is rare , accounting for 1% of all salivary gland tumors .
however , because myoepithelioma is an extremely rare apg tumor subtype and the imaging findings of myoepithelioma resemble those of pa , which is the most common benign apg tumor subtype , we believe that it is nearly impossible to preoperatively distinguish myoepithelioma of the apg from pa of the apg or low - grade malignant tumors , even by using fnac , given that kawashima et al .   also misdiagnosed a myoepithelioma of the apg as a suspected adenoid cystic carcinoma ( after fnac ) .
