the nomogram including the variables , ecog performance , albumin , weight loss and previous esophagectomy predicts survival in mescc patients and could serve as a guide for the use of fp / xp chemotherapy in mescc patients .
similar to the os findings , the nomogram significantly identified the pfs of the three groups as follows : favorable risk group , 5.9 months ( 95% ci , 4.6 to 7.2 months ) ; intermediate risk group , 4.3 months ( 95% ci , 3.3 to 5.3 months ) ; and poor risk group , 3.0 months ( 95% ci , 2.3 to 3.8 months ) ( p<0.001 ) ( fig .
the nomogram could discriminate between risk groups very well with the following median os for each risk group : favorable risk group , 13.8 months ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 10.82 to 18.58 months ) ; intermediate risk group , 11.2 months ( 95% ci , 8.7 to 11.89 months ) ; and poor risk group ( 7.0 months ; 95% ci , 3.56 to 10.04 months ; p<0.001 ) ( fig .
the median os according to risk groups were : favorable risk group , 15.5 months ; intermediate risk group , 7.8 months ; and poor risk group , 5.1 months ( p<0.001 ) ( fig .
