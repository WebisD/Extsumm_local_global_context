this paper reports a rare case of association between takotsubo and hip fracture surgery , which has been described only by two previous studies , .
despite being a rare condition , takotsubo syndrome is a possible differential diagnosis of the bcis , which recently emerged 
originally described in japan in 1990 , its eponym was coined using the two japanese terms tako ( octopus ) and tsubo ( pot ) , due to the resemblance between the cardiac apical ballooning ( hallmark of the syndrome ) and the octopus trap ( a kind of ceramic pot ) used by japanese fishermen .
the acute functional and instrumental abnormalities accompanying takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in the absence of significant coronary alterations , and could be completely recovered within a few weeks up to two months . if promptly recognized and correctly managed , despite the severity of its onset and the potentially life - threatening characteristics ( those of a cardiogenic shock ) , this syndrome normally presents a good prognosis with low morbidity and in - hospital mortality rates , , .
takotsubo   cardiomyopathy , or  transient apical ballooning syndrome  , is a non - ischemic cardiomyopathy that mimics the onset of an acute myocardial infarction .
