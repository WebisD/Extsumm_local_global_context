we examined the association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure in the very elderly subjects using data from a sample of chinese nonagenarians and centenarians ,
none of the differences in sleep quality scores , sleep latency , sleep efficiency percentage and prevalence of poor sleep quality was significant ( sleep quality scores : 6.712.71 vs. 6.952.48 , p=0.172 ; sleep latency : 44.3513.42 vs. 47.1417.99 , p=0.347 ; sleep efficiency percentage : 79.2111.91 vs. 74.3513.44 , p=0.469 ; prevalence of poor sleep quality : 22.64% vs. 21.98% , p=0.813 in subjects without and with systolic hypertension , respectively ) . between subjects with and without diastolic hypertension , none of the differences in sleep quality scores , sleep latency , sleep efficiency percentage and prevalence of poor sleep quality was significant ( sleep quality scores : 6.773.01 vs. 7.312.67 , p=0.212 ; sleep latency : 45.9913.57 vs. 45.2211.65 , p=0.881 ; sleep efficiency percentage : 76.342.25 vs. 77.792.81 , p=0.786 ; prevalence of poor sleep quality : 26.74% vs. 21.60% , p=0.207 in subjects without and with diastolic hypertension , respectively ) .
none of the differences in sleep quality scores , sleep latency , sleep efficiency percentage and prevalence of poor sleep quality was significant ( sleep quality scores : 6.672.59 vs. 6.972.66 , p=0.139 ; sleep latency : 44.1013.17 vs. 47.2318.11 , p=0.235 ; sleep efficiency percentage : 79.1712.64 vs. 74.5614.36 , p=0.473 ; prevalence of poor sleep quality : 22.34% vs. 22.22% , p=0.778 in subjects without and with hypertension , respectively ) . between subjects with and without systolic hypertension ,
