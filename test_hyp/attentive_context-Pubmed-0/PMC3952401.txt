then , our method was further validated / correlated with the results obtained from in - vivo cellular magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , an imaging technique that can detect macrophage infiltration when labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron - oxide ( uspio ) or micron - sized iron - oxide ( mpio ) particles .
our method was also validated / correlated with the results obtained from ex - vivo cellular mri , which were conducted using magnetic resonance microscopy ( mrm ) to achieve a much higher resolution for our final examination . to demonstrate the potential utilities of our method , we trained the algorithm to recognize different targets under hematoxylin and eosin ( h and e ) stain and to present their distribution across the tissue sections .
the density distribution of the identified stains was calculated by the kernel density estimator , yielding a distribution image of a feature or a particular cell type labeled by the stains . to validate our method , we applied it to specimen slides from an ongoing study using a rat cardiac allograft rejection model and also another study using a rat heart ischemia / reperfusion injury model . in both studies , the macrophage infiltration was revealed by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) with anti - rat ed1 antibody .
