therefore , this study aims to help adult women with lumbar disc herniation recover muscle 
 strength and stability through 8-week lumber extension strength exercise programs , and to 
 provide data for constructing an integrated exercise program .
significant differences were observed in lumbar extension strength ( les ) between 
 pre - exercise and post - exercise at every angle of lumbar flexion , but no significant 
 difference was found in wdi ( % ) ( table

in this study , an 8-week exercise program for lumbar muscle extension strength and 
 stabilization was performed by 26 females older than 20 with lumbar disc herniation .
the post - exercise les were found to be very significantly ( p<0.01 ) higher 
 than pre - exercise at 0 degree and 12 degree , and extremity significantly ( p<0.001 ) higher 
 than pre - exercise at 24 , 36 , 48 , and 72 degrees of lumbar flexion .
the above results indicate that improving muscle extension strength to enhance and improve 
 the functions the patients with chronic back pain or lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus can 
 help improve muscle functions and increase the range of joint motion thereby exerting a 
 positive impact on physical stability .
