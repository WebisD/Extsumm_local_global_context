we collected data of all patients with ich diagnosed via a plain computed tomography ( ct ) of the brain with positive dengue virus type 1 nonstructural protein ( ns1 ) antigen test or positive dengue serology igm with thrombocytopenia from january 2014 till june 2015 at our center .
more research is needed in this field to determine possible predictors of ich such as dengue igg in dengue infection .
a total of nine patients ( patient a to patient i ) were analyzed at our center .
the data included were basic demographic data , existing comorbid , presenting symptoms , other dengue - related complications , the day ich was diagnosed in relation to onset of fever , glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) , and pupils size and light response on presentation , platelet counts during diagnosis of ich , lowest platelet counts recorded , international normalized ratio ( inr ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) , dengue igm and igg seropositivity , type of ich , volume of ich , presence of midline shift and patency of basal cisterns , surgical intervention , and outcome .
there are three methods of laboratory detection in our center , namely , panbio dengue igm capture elisa ( sensitivity of 94.7% for primary infections , 55.7% for secondary infections and specificity of 100% ) , diaxis dengue ns1 antigen test ( sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 99% ) , and acco dengue igg / igm - ns1 combo rapid detection kit ( igg / igm : sensitivity 90% and specificity 100% , ns1 : sensitivity 96% and specificity 100% ) .
