the purpose of this study was to describe national trends in immigrant and social class inequalities in the prevalence of obesity and overweight and to identify immigrant and social class groups who are at high risk of obesity and who have experienced substantial increases in their obesity rates .
specifically , we ( 1 ) estimate over time changes in obesity and overweight prevalence among 30 major immigrant groups stratified by race / ethnicity and length of immigration and among detailed education , occupation , and income groups , using large , nationally representative samples of us adults and ( 2 ) compare the magnitude of ethnic - immigrant and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and overweight prevalence among adults aged  18 over time .
not shown here , we found that although increased pa was associated with reduced obesity risks in both immigrants and natives , adjusting for pa levels had little impact on the magnitude of ethnic - immigrant differentials in adult obesity .
.01 ) the odds and prevalence of obesity and overweight , even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors , increased with increasing duration in the us ( tables  1 , 2 ) .
consistent with previous research on acculturation and obesity risks among us and canadian immigrants  , our study showed increasing obesity rates with increasing duration of us residence in both 19921995 and 20032008 .
