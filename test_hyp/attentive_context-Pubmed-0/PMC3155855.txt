this paper explores demographic and stroke - related factors ( predictor variables ) , including patient age , which may be associated with individual measures of quality of care provided to acute stroke patients by allied health professionals .
our aim was to provide systematically determined information to guide clinical quality audits and targeted quality improvement strategies in stroke care .
ensuring the highest quality of allied health care for all stroke patients is important in the current climate of scarce resources and the increasing burden of stroke to the health sector .
to understand fully the important factors influencing the quality of care provided to acute stroke patients by allied health professionals will require further investigations into their perspectives on the capacity of stroke patients to improve , and how they make care decisions .
significant correlations were found between patient age , and the predictor variables of stroke severity , comorbidity levels , premorbid accommodation , premorbid independence level , gender , english proficiency , and length of stay . in summary , compared with younger patients , patients 75 years or older were significantly more likely to have a moderate - to - severe or severe stroke ( or : 1.8 , 95% ci : 1.13.2 and or : 2.9 , 95% ci : 1.46.1 , respectively ) , to have higher comorbidity levels ( or : 2.5 , 95% ci : 1.54.2 ) , to have lived in residential care ( or : 2.6 , 95% ci : 1.16.2 ) , or been previously dependent ( or : 6.2 , 95% ci : 3.212 ) .
