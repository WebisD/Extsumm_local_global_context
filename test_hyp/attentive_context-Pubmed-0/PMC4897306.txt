hence , this study was carried out to investigate and compare the protective effect of administration of both tannic and gallic acids on normal and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in rats .
the results of the present study revealed that oxidative stress and apoptosis / necrosis play an important role in pathogenesis of cisplatin nephrotoxicity .
gallic and tannic acids , two important pharmacologically active phenolic compounds , reduced cisplatin induced functional and histological renal damage .
however , both pretreatment with gallic and tannic acids orally at two doses , 20 and 40  mg / kg body weight , respectively , shows a significant ( p < 0.05 ) reduction of mda content in rat kidney when compared with the induced group ( figure 1 ) . 

however , pretreatment with gallic and tannic acids orally at two doses , 20 and 40  mg / kg body weight , respectively , shows a significant ( p < 0.05 ) improvement of renal function due to a decrease in the creatinine , urea , and uric acid levels when compared with the induced group ( group 2 ) . also , administration of a single i.p dose of cisplatin ( 7.5  mg / kg bwt ) caused a significant decrease in the biomarkers of oxidative stress [ superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , catalase ( cat ) , glutathione peroxidase ( gpx ) , and reduced glutathione ( gsh ) ] when compared with the control group that received only saline ( 0.85%  w / v ) ( table 2 ) .
