the analysis of the data have clearly shown the following : ( i ) mono- and mixed microbial colonization / infection of human oral pathogens in rat oral cavity during 7 weeks of periodontal disease ( gained access to the oral epithelium ) , ( ii ) generation of a specific serum igg antibody responses ( as early as 7 weeks ) reflecting the oral infection ( engagement of systemic host response mechanisms ) , ( iii ) induction of enhanced horizontal and interproximal alveolar bone resorption in rats with mixed infection as expected ( direct result of local infection ) , ( iv ) induction of inflammatory response ( apical migration of je , rete ridge elongation , crestal alveolar bone loss , pmns ) consistent with established characteristics of periodontal disease , and ( v ) no synergistic virulence observed with p. gingivalis / t .
this mixed infection model will provide an opportunity for further studies to clarify the characteristics and alterations of the host response profiles such as proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in periodontal tissues that relate to osteoclastic alveolar bone loss in response to mixed infections .
this study examined mixed microbial periodontal disease using p. gingivalis and t. denticola as a consortium and examined their colonization / infection characteristics , periodontal inflammation parameters , immune response patterns , induction of alveolar bone resorption , and virulence interactions .
