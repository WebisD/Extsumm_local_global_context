the methodology has been described in detail in a previously published article.9 in summary , this study involved the prospective collection of data on all trauma patients attended to by the scottish ambulance service ( sas ) and emergency medical retrieval service ( emrs ) in scotland , for a complete year .
the need to balance conflicting objectives  such as accessibility , center case volumes , and need for aeromedical transport  is a particular feature of networks caring for patients with highly acute conditions .
our analysis indicates that a trauma system configuration with one mtc , in glasgow , or two mtcs , in glasgow and edinburgh , would be optimal , based on observed data .
the performance characteristics of each trauma system configuration , which we examined , included the estimated number of primarily admitted patients ( directly from the scene ) with severe injury ( per center ) , the number of interfacility transfers of patients with severe injury , the total number of severely injured patients ( including interfacility transfers ) per center , the median access time for all patients , the median access time for patients triaged to mtc care and taken to an mtc , and the number of helicopter flights required .
