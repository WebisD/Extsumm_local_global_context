according to the present research , concentrations less than 4 mg / ml of nano bioactive glass produced in iran have no genotoxic effect and there is no statistical difference between nano bioactive glass and novabone bioglass in concentrations less than 5 mg/ ml .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxicity of a novel nano bioactive glass and novabone bioglass with control group in gingival fibroblasts cells using scge assay .
comparison of comet parameters in different concentrations of nano bioactive glass and novabone bioglass with control sample ( p  0.05 ) nano bioactive glass generated statistically significant amount of dna damaged at concentration of 5 mg / ml in tail length and tail moment parameters compared with negative control ( p  0.05 ) .
the comparison between cells corresponding to negative control and the concentrations of nano bioglass revealed statistically significant difference ( p  0.05 ) in concentrations of 4 mg / ml and 5 mg / ml in tail length and tail moment parameters [ table 1 ] .
therefore , other biocompatibility tests are needed to approve the application of new nano bioactive glass for regenerative therapy in periodontics .
evaluated the genotoxicity of hydroxyapatite bioceramics using comet assay and showed that biomaterials induced dna break , which increased with increasing the bioceramic concentration . according to this fact , it could be expected that the genotoxicity of biomaterials depends on the amount of concentration and it is so critical to detect the threshold . the comparison between cells corresponding to negative control and the concentrations of nano bioactive glass revealed statistically significant difference ( p  0.05 ) in concentrations of 4 mg / ml and 5 mg / ml in tail length and tail moment parameters [ table 1 ] .
