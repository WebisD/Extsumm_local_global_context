in conclusion we propose that tissue pcr for dna of borrelia should be performed in patients with lsa in endemic area , because it could represent a rare manifestation of borreliosis , and in those cases lsa should be treated with proper antibiotic therapy in order to eradicate the microorganism .
lichen sclerosus et atrophicans ( lsa ) is a chronic inflammatory muco - cutaneous disorder , characterized by sclerotic and atrophic lesions , most commonly found in adult women .
the etiology of lsa is still unknown . besides the genetic and local factors ( koebner phenomenon ) and the autoimmune hypothesis , supported by the association of different autoimmune disorders , especially of thyroid origin ( 30% of cases ) , an infectious hypothesis has also been proposed .
this report describes a case of lsa , which was unusual for the involvement of the scalp
a 57-year - old caucasian woman presented with a history of asymptomatic frontoparietal lesion . such lesion , which had been developing over the 3 previous years , was initially erythematous and became progressively atrophic and sclerodermic .
thanks to this combined therapy a remarkable regression of the atrophic - sclerodermic lesion was observed .
