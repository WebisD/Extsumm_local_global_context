in this 10-year population - based study , we found that those with treated diabetes had a twofold increased risk of dementia / cind among older mexican americans , even after accounting for the competing risk of mortality and changes over time in risk factor exposures .
cognitive screening in those with diabetes is warranted by the preponderance of evidence supporting a robust link between diabetes and dementia .
time - dependent stroke did not modify the association between diabetes and dementia / cind ( interaction between stroke and diabetes p = 0.97 ; data not shown ) .
comparison of dementia / cind risk in treated to untreated diabetes was not significant ( hr 1.32 [ 95% ci 0.802.19 ] , p = 0.28 ) . in model 2 , adjustment for time - dependent waist circumference , a potential confounder of the association between diabetes and dementia / cind risk , increased the hrs for treated diabetes and untreated diabetes by 10 and 15% , respectively , compared with the base model ( model 1 ) , which adjusted for only age ( as time scale ) , sex , and years of education . in model 3 ( fully adjusted model ) , addition of time - dependent stroke modestly decreased the hr for treated diabetes by 9% and untreated diabetes by 10% , but the association with treated diabetes remained strong and statistically significant .
