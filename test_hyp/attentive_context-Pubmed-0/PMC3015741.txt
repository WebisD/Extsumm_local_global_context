we report the case of an upper tract urothelial carcinoma in the renal pelvis resected with bipolar cautery through percutaneous access without deactivation of the cardiac pacemaker . to our knowledge
bipolar electrocautery is a safe and feasible resection modality in percutaneously approached upper tract urothelial neoplasms in patients with cardiac pacemakers .
it is well established that the presence of neoplasms in the upper tract urothelium necessitates the en bloc removal of the ipsilateral kidney , ureter , and bladder cuff as the standard of care based on the premise that urothelial cancers are caused by a field change or defect . however , due to the morbidity associated with open nephroureterectomies , conservative management may be appropriate for poor surgical candidates .
the reported recurrence rates have been low , and disease - free survival is comparable to that in patients treated with nephroureterectomy . the use of monopolar electrosurgery however can interfere with cardiac pacemakers resulting in potentially fatal dysrhythmias .  
percutaneous and ureteroscopic techniques have been utilized in the management of urothelial tumors with percutaneous access required to treat larger of upper tract urothelial cancers being used in suitable candidates.various techniques for this approach have been reported including monopolar electrocautery , laser , rollerball , and electrovaporization .
