therefore , the present study was designed to investigate the potential effects of nigella sativa with glycyrrhiza glabra and zingiber officinale ( ngz ) extracts on cell viability , lipid peroxidation level , ros content and apoptotic induction in h9c2 cardiomyocytes .
it was shown that all of three extract produced protective effect on h9c2 cell against dox - induced toxicity with different potencies , but similar efficacy with a maximum effect of about 30 percent .
cell viability was assayed to determine the optimum concentrations necessary for the three extracts ( n , g and z ) to protect h9c2 cells against dox - induced cytotoxicity .
the effects of extracts in combination showed a positive interaction between components of different extracts , which augments their protective effect .
also , in a polyherbal preparation , ginger was one of the components and reported to be effective against dox - induced cardio toxicity without interfering its antineoplastic activity ( 51 ) .
these may lead to the development of a new class of drugs to prevent cardio toxicity of dox and improve its anticancer effect .
weak antioxidant capacity in cardiomyocytes may be a risk factor responsible for their high sensitivity to oxidative damage ( 42 ) , and a promising approach to cardioprotection is the use of pharmacological tools to reduce oxidative stress in the heart ( 37 ) . in the present study , we used h9c2 cells as a pharmacological model to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effects of three different prevalent medicinal plants , n. sativa , glycyrrhizin glabra and zingiber officinale alone and in combination with all three ( ngz ) .
