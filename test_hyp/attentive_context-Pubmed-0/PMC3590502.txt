furthermore , pretreatment with dpi or blockade of lox-1 with anti - lox-1 mab or sirna - lox-1 prevented oxldl - induced ros generation and cell apoptosis , which suggests that the binding of oxldl to lox-1 and the consequent formation of ros may be the first event in lox-1-mediated endothelial dysfunction ( figures 1 and 4 ) .
, we speculated that 6-shogaol protection against oxldl - induced endothelial dysfunction may be by blockading the binding of oxldl to lox-1 , and subsequently decrease intracellular ros generation and the proinflammatory molecules expression .
it has been shown that oxldl - induced endothelial dysfunction is caused by an increase in nadph oxidase - generated superoxide concentrations and a decrease in antioxidative enzyme activity , resulting in the activation of multiple ros - sensitive signaling pathways .
ros can activate nf-b and enable nuclear translocation and subsequent regulation of proinflammatory molecules , including cytokines , chemokines , enzymes , and adhesion molecules . in the present study , ros production in huvecs occurred within 5  min ( data not shown ) , and nf-b was activated within 1.5  h of the addition of oxldl . however , pretreatment with anti - lox-1 mab , ros production , and nf-b activation , and icam-1 , mcp-1 , and e - selectin expression were decreased markedly , which suggests that the binding of oxldl to lox-1 and the consequent nf-b activation .
