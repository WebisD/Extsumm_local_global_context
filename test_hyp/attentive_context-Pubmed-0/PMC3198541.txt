we discuss how this crossmodal sensory recalibration is continuously engaged in updating unisensory perceptual processing and is an integral part of perceptual processing . in section  improvement in unisensory sensitivity as a result of multisensory associative learning ,  we present results from an adaptation study that shows that passive exposure to consistently paired auditory and visual features enhances visual sensitivity .
this is despite the fact that several studies indicate that unisensory processing is altered through multisensory experience . in section  improvement in unisensory sensitivity as a result of correlated multisensory training ,  we describe recent studies that show that training observers using correlated auditory  visual stimuli improves subsequent performance in a unisensory ( visual or auditory ) detection , discrimination , and recognition task . in section  change in unisensory map as a result of exposure to crossmodal error ,  we discuss recent research demonstrating that momentary exposure to auditory  visual spatial discrepancy results in a shift in the auditory space map .
this diversity of phenomena suggests that these multisensory influences on unisensory learning may reflect a general strategy of learning in the brain .
these three sets of findings involve very different types of learning  perceptual learning , recalibration , and associative learning  and may involve different mechanisms and time scales , yet they all show a significant influence of multisensory processing on unisensory representations .
