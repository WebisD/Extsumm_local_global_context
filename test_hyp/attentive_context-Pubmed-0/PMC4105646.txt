another technique that has been used in multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy is the ultrasound guided free hand method , in which ultrasound guided visualisation of the cavity is used to guide catheter insertion into the cavity with needle placement being marked on the skin prior to the insertion . while both techniques have their advantages and remain popular at different centres , there is no published data that compares the two techniques . in this study , we look at both techniques comparing the insertion time , planning time , and the dosimetric outcomes .
when we compared dosimetry from the plans , we found that the d95 was 3.13 gy ( 92% of the prescribed dose ) on average with the non - template method , which was significantly lower compared to 3.3 gy ( 97% of the prescribed dose on average ) with the template method ( p value < 0.01 ) .
compared to the non - template approach , the template approach offered significantly shorter insertion and planning times with improved dosimetric ptveval coverage without significantly compromising organs at risk .
between august 2008 and march 2010 , 20 consecutive patients treated with apbi with multicatheter hdr interstitial brachytherapy were included in the study .
