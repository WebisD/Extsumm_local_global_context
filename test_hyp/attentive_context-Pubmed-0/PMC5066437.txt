, we investigated the risk factors and locations of cmbs in patients with different ischemic stroke subtypes , and the risk factors for cmbs in different locations .
in fact , up to one - third of cardioembolic stroke ( ce ) cases demonstrate cmbs [ 14 - 16 ] . considering that patients with ce require long - term anticoagulation , and that anticoagulation increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage , especially in patients with multiple cmbs , understanding the pathomechanism of cmbs according to ischemic stroke subtype or location may be important in determining the treatment strategy for secondary stroke prevention . in our current study
notwithstanding the above limitations , our present study demonstrated that the distribution and risk factors associated with cmbs differed by stroke subtype , especially in patients with ce compared with svo or laa .
ischemic stroke patients who were admitted within 1 week of stroke onset to the stroke center at asan medical center ( seoul , korea ) between january 2007 and january 2010 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively collected database . among these cases ,
second , we used both 1.5 t and 3.0 t mri , although 1.5 t mri is inferior for the detection of cmbs .
