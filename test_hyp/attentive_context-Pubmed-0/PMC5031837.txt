all urine tubular biomarkers were independent predictors of rapid renal progression among t2 dm patients . for future study , in early stage t2 dm in the normo- or microalbuminuria group , novel tubular biomarkers may possibly have a role in early detection compared to the conventional marker to predict ckd progression .
t2 dm patients with high levels of urine tubular biomarkers ( urine cystatin - c , angiotensinogen , kim-1 , and ngal ) presented more rapid decline in renal function .
roc analysis showed an auc for uccr , uang , ukim-1 , ungal , and uacr of 0.72 ( 95% ci : 0.64 to 0.79 ) , 0.71 ( 95% ci : 0.63 to 0.79 ) , 0.71 ( 95% ci : 0.63 to 0.79 ) , 0.64 ( 95% ci : 0.560.72 ) , and 0.76 ( 95% ci : 0.680.84 ) , respectively , as shown in figure 2 .
subjects with uccr , uang , ukim-1 , and ungal values above 3.43  mcg / g , 4.52  mcg / g , 95  ng / g , and 772  ng / g , respectively , experienced a significantly faster evolution to endpoint ( p < 0.05 ) with a mean follow - up time to progression of 12 months . to identify putative risk factors
