a 66-year - old male presented to the emergency department after a fall and a mild head trauma .
, we describe a patient on anticoagulant therapy that developed an acute subdural haematoma ( sdh ) 48 hours after a mild head injury .
furthermore , this case report wishes to raise the awareness among emergency department physicians and neurosurgeons that treat elderly anticoagulated patients , for a possible delayed onset of intracranial haematoma , even if the initial assessment is normal .
our case report underlines the need , that physicians and neurosurgeons should maintain a high level of vigilance in anticoagulated patients , after a mild tbi , due to a possible delayed onset of intracranial haematoma , even if the initial assessment is normal .
this case is another example of the very low risk of delayed subdural haematoma after minor head injury in patients , who are treated with anticoagulants .
traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) is the most frequent reason for neurosurgical consultation in the emergency room .
for the subgroup of patients over the age of 65 and with an inr greater than 2.5 , we suggest to extend the observation period to 48 hours followed by a ct scan .
