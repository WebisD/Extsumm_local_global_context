this ex vivo study evaluated the quality of digital radiographic images obtained with the digora system according to the processing delay and maintenance of optical plates in either opaque ( supplied with the system ) or transparent protective plastic cases during this period .
the findings of the present study revealed that the processing delay of 120 min for the digora system caused a reduction in image quality , yet without interfering with the quality of diagnosis .
the study was conducted on a dry human mandible fixed on an acrylic resin base .
there was statistically significant difference ( p<0.05 ) regarding the processing delays , namely immediate , 5 and 60 min with utilization of opaque case ( table 2 ) .
no statistically significant difference ( p>0.05 ) was observed among processing delays with utilization of transparent case ( table 4 ) .

 table 1 presents the scores assigned by examiners to the images , according to processing delays and utilization of opaque or transparent plastic cases .
