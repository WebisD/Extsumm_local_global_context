treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab injections according to the scheme of saturation phase followed by re - treatment based on oct image and va , provides amd patients with a chance of stabilization and even improvement of topical state with a lower number of injections and preserved topical and general safety .
the aim of this paper is evaluation of functional and anatomical results of intravitreal ranibizumab injections and of exudative amd treatment course in our 12-month observational study .
the main goal is to improve vision and maintain this improvement at a maximum over time , with a minimum of inconvenience for patients ( mostly elderly ) and the treating physician . at the moment
