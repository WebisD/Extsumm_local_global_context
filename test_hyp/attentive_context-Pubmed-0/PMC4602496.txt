the objective of this study was to biomechanically assess the effect of a simulated large lateral talar process excision ( up to 10  cm ) on ankle and subtalar joint stability and ankle pressures .
, a 10-cm fragment excision alone did produce a statistically significant tibiotalar tilt in inversion ( p  =  .04 ) in comparison with the pre - excision phase . regarding the compression forces at the ankle joint level , following the excision , no significant changes in peak force , center of force movement , contact area , and contact area pressure
further studies are required to determine the optimal treatment of ligament reconstruction and/or refixation of the detached ligaments following resection of a large lateral talar process fragment and its implication on late ankle osteoarthritis .
peak force , center of force movement , contact area and contact area pressure in terms of mean value    standard deviation , as defined from the pressure measurements in the ankle joint of 6 specimens under axial load in pre - excision , 5-cm and 10-cm excision phases with respect to forced inversion , the only statistical significance was seen in tt angle change from neutral hindfoot alignment to forced inversion between pre - excision and 10-cm excision ( p  =  .04 , table 1 ) .
