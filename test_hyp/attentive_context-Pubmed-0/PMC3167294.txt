the aim of this preliminary work was to characterize donkey and horse y chromosome highly repetitive dna sequences , to understand resemblances and differences between the two y chromosomes isolated approximately 2 my ago .
horse - donkey hybrids ( mules and hinnies ) exhibit massive meiotic dysfunction at the primary spermatocyte stage , and a large part of this dysfunction is caused by the incompatibility of synaptonemal pairing between paternal and maternal chromosomes , resulting in the total arrest of spermatogenesis .
, our research group has developed a method , whole comparative genomic hybridization ( w - cgh ) , which allows the identification of chromosomal polymorphisms related to sat - dnas localized in constitutive heterochromatin .
furthermore , the y chromosome tends to be unusually rich in repetitive dnas , due to both transposable elements and tandem arrays of sat - dna sequences .
this aspect is of interest , as it is known that differences in heterochromatin content in pericentromeric or distal chromosome regions , even within the same species , cause chiasma redistribution due to misleading chromosome pairing .
in addition to the genome macro - variations concerning chromosome number and morphology described for horse and donkey , it is interesting to stress that eight centromere repositioning episodes occurred when the karyotypes of zebra , horse and stallion were compared .
