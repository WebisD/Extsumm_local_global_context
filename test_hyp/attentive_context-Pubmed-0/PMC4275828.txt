five patients with a drop foot resulting from osteochondroma of the proximal fibula who did not receive a proper diagnosis in neurosurgery and physical therapy clinics are presented .
mechanical entrapment by an osteochondroma in this anatomic region is a rare occurrence . in this study ,
in spite of its frequent occurrence , drop foot associated with peroneal nerve entrapment by an osteochondroma is not easily remembered and diagnosed . especially in pediatric patients , drop foot can be overlooked during physical examination and may even be more difficult to detect in non - orthopedic clinics . with careful physical examination along with radiologic and electrophysiologic studies ,
nerve entrapment can be easily diagnosed , enabling surgeons to perform surgery in a timely manner , thus preventing further sequelae .
a 2.5-year - old boy presented to the neurosurgery clinic with the complaint of limping that started shortly after beginning to walk .
peroneal nerve entrapment is the most frequent nerve entrapment in the lower extremities and the third most common entrapment in the body , following the median and ulnar nerves .
although the mean time that passed until the patients consulted with us was 5.7 months ( range : 312 months ) , the loss of muscle strength in our cases fully recovered following surgery .
