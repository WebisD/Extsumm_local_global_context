we describe our experience regarding a large - bowel obstruction caused by phytobezoar in a patient with a transplanted kidney .
bezoar is a rare disorder , however , it must be suspected in case of mechanical intestinal obstruction .
our case underlined the importance of early detection and removal of a bezoar to prevent complications such as obstruction , perforation , or peritonitis .
a 39-year - old man was admitted to our hospital for constipation , distension , and severe acute abdominal pain in the lower left quadrant .
contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) is the method of choice to identify the location , severity , and etiology of intestinal obstruction .
based on the ct findings , particularly mottled gas pattern and encapsulated wall of the mass , we made the diagnosis of phytobezoar . hence , because of acute intestinal obstruction and to avoid peritonitis , the patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy .
his medical history included alport syndrome resulting in progressive chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , hypertension , and iron deficiency anemia under medical treatment .
bezoars are masses formed by the condensation of debris or stomach contents in the gastrointestinal tract
