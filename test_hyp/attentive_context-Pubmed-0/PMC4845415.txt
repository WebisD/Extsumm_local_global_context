acute patellar dislocation is a common injury usually associated with a significant traumatic mechanism resulting in lateral displacement .
a 32-year old gentleman presented with an irreducible patella dislocation following an unusual atraumatic mechanism . following attempts at closed reduction under sedation and regional nerve block , eventual open reduction and soft tissue reconstruction was required under general anesthetic . during the open reduction procedure , it was noted that the patella had dislocated into a lateral extra - articular position and rotated around its vertical axis .
vertical axis rotation following dislocation is a rare variant of this type of injury and can prevent closed reduction in the acute setting .
a review of the literature suggests dislocations such as the current presentation , are extremely rare and although have been described to occur with minor trauma , have never been described to occur following a largely atraumatic event . in such cases ,
closed reduction may be impossible even with adequate analgesia due to patella position and soft tissue obstruction .
we would recommend a low threshold for open reduction in such cases by a specialist knee surgeon who may assess and reconstruct damaged soft tissue damage in one operation vertical axis rotation is a rare entity complicating patella dislocations . in this rare event
