the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pretreatment with 50% n2o in oxygen on the speed of inhalation induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane in women undergoing minor gynecological procedures .
under the present study design , breathing of 50% n2o in oxygen before induction with sevoflurane enhances the speed of induction in the very early period as assessed by the bis monitor .
points 60 , 90 , 120 and 150 s , the bis values in the n2o versus air group were : 77  19.0 versus 92  8.6 ( p < 0.001 ) , 44  19.8 versus 73  21.4 ( p < 0.001 ) , 36  12.4 versus 55  24.7 ( p = 0.002 ) and 32  11.0 versus 45  20.8 ( p = 0.014 ) , respectively .
bis , etco2 , vt , rr , spo2 , hr and fi and fe sevoflurane concentrations in the n2o- and air - breathing groups during induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane bispectral index values ( mean  standard deviation ) during inhalation with sevoflurane in the nitrous oxide and air groups
the flow diagram of the study during sevoflurane inhalation in the n2o group the study was interrupted in one patient at 120 s due to persisting cough and salivation , in one patient at 180 s due to tachypnea , tachycardia and upper airway obstruction , in one patient at 210 s due to tachypnea and tachycardia , in one patient at 240 s due to upper airway obstruction , and in one patient at 270 s due to prolonged apnea .
