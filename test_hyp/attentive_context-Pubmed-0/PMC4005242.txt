our study suggests that a combined t - cat + cxl is an effective approach to not only biomechanically stabilize the cornea in keratoconus , but also to improve the corneal contour , reduce irregular astigmatism and offer a better quality of vision than cxl alone could do .
preoperative demographic and refractive parameters in each group and the statistical differences between them pre - operative topographic and tomographic parameters in each group and the statistical differences between them changes in refractive , visual and topographic parameters following treatment in each group and statistical differences within and between each group the retinoscopic cylinder decreased by 1.02 d  3.16 d in the cxl group ( p = 0.11 ) and by 2.87  3.22 d in the t - cat + cxl group ( p = 0.039 ) .
the base of the cone flattened by a mean of 1.39  13.41 d in the cxl group ( p = 0.86 ) and by a mean of 4.94  11.46 d in the t - cat + cxl group ( p = 0.05 ) . the sag factor and surface asymmetry index showed no significant change in the cxl group but reduced significantly by 3.59  5.94 d ( p = 0.01 ) and 0.72  1.18 ( p = 0.02 ) respectively in the t - cat + cxl group .
