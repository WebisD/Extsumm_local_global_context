therefore , this study was conducted to investigate the effect of nintendo wii fit 
 training on the dorsiflexion / plantar flexion strength ratio as a new concept in the field of 
 prevention and rehabilitation of ankle injuries .
the mean values of the ankle dorsiflexion / plantar flexion strength ratio decreased 
 significantly ( f=7.41 , p=0.01 ) between before and after the training .
however , there 
 was no significant difference between before and after the training period in the control 
 group ( table 2table 2.comparison of the mean changes in the ankle dorsiflexion / plantar flexion strength

they were randomly assigned , using simple blind 
 randomization by using procedures such as coin tossing into two equal groups : an
