this article describes a rare case report of bilateral di in the mandibular second premolars that were treated nonsurgically .
dens invaginatus ( di ) is a developmental anomaly that results in a deepening or invagination of the enamel organ into the dental papilla prior to calcification of the dental tissues .
a 25-year - old male patient reported to the department of conservative dentistry and endodontics of our institution with a chief complaint of bilateral swellings in relation to the lower right and left posterior teeth since the last 2 months .
this is unfortunate as the presence of an invagination is thought to increase the risk of dental caries , pulpal involvement , and periodontal inflammation .
this type of malformation was first described by ploquet in 1794 in a whale 's tooth .
di was first described as a  tooth within a tooth  by salter in 1855 while socrates in 1856 reported the first case of di in a human tooth .
although di is a relatively common anomaly , it may be easily overlooked due to the absence of any significant clinical signs .
careful radiographic examination and knowledge of the variations in morphology of the internal anatomy of teeth are thus necessary for a successful treatment outcome .
