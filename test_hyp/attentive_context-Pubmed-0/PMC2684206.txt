the purpose of this review is to describe hamstring injuries as they relate to an athletic population and to summarize the current literature with respect to risk stratification , treatment decisions , and prevention of recurrent injury .
efforts at management should incorporate proven standards of acute muscle injury care with rehabilitation efforts that consider the total activity - specific demands on lower extremity and pelvic kinetics .
hamstring injuries are common in sports that involve sudden bursts of running , and can be frustrating for both athletes and physicians due to the unpredictability and wide variability of return to play in any given athlete . of all muscle injuries , hamstring strains have one of the highest recurrence rates .
biomechanical analysis of hamstring function is complex due to its ability to influence movement at multiple joints , which in turn makes identification of clear risk factors and development of effective injury prevention scenarios a challenge .
hamstring mechanics are complex , making efforts at predicting injury patterns and developing injury treatment and prevention protocols difficult .
the hamstring is actually a group of four muscles , three of which originate in common at the ischial tuberosity and then diverge to attach distal to the knee .
