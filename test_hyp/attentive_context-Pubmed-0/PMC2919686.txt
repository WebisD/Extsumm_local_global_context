we describe the successful treatment of an acute chloroform ingestion with intravenously administered n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) despite having one of the highest reported serum chloroform levels in a survivor .
aggressive treatment with supportive care , with emphasis on protecting the airway and ventilation , as well as the use of nac therapy to treat hepatic injury , can result in complete recovery even with significant elevated chloroform levels .
most cases of chloroform toxicity are the result of inhalational exposures , and very few reports involve oral ingestions . since this route of exposure is exceedingly rare , information regarding the clinical course and management dilemmas of chloroform ingestions is limited .
toxicity from chloroform can include central nervous system depression , cardiac arrhythmias , hepatic injury , and hepatic cancer .
a 19-year - old african - american man was found unconscious in his car with a suicide note and a half - empty bottle of chloroform he had ordered on the internet from overseas ( fig .  1 ) .
however , our patient presented with a chloroform level well above reports of previous fatalities , and his ast and alt peaked at only 224 and 583
