is it possible that the source of the detected brucella sp dna was denatured dna from diet , not from an active brucella sp infection ?
medulloblastoma , a primitive neuro - ectodermal tumor ( pnet ) arising in the posterior fossa , is one of the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system ( cns ) in children . overall survival for children with non - disseminated and non - anaplastic medulloblastoma can approach 80%.1 radiologic and histopathologic features include hyperattenuation on unenhanced computed tomographic scans that reflects the high nuclear - cytoplasmic ratio seen at histological analysis.2 medulloblastoma can also occur in late middle age with identical histopathologic findings to those found in childhood .
this study showed an unexpected presence of brucella sp in ffpe cns tissues from patients who died from malignancy in the brain .
the idea of a brucella species or the disease brucellosis being associated with brain tumors , specifically medulloblastoma or glioblastoma must be addressed with caution .
more studies would be needed to further investigate any true association between brucella sp dna positivity and cns tumor formation .
gastric cancer develops in persons infected with helicobacter pylori but not in uninfected persons.16 one bacteria - like agent mycoplasma fermentans has been shown in the laboratory to induce a mycoplasma - mediated multistage malignant transformation of cultured mouse embryo cells ( c3h).17 positive dna findings for brucella species in our index patients focused our attention on studying medulloblastomas , as shown in this index patient , serological examination and cultures for brucellosis were non - contributory .
