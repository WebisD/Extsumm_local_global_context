therefore the defining cytogenetic abnormality is a balanced translocation t(11;22 ) expressing the ews / friend leukemia integration-1 ( fli-1 ) chimeric fusion protein .
metastatic ews should be diagnosed early as it is difficult to control and treatment needs a multimodality approach constituting chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy .
we report the above case in a 14-year - old girl with involvement of l5 vertebra and sacral bone with metastasis to multiple sites at the time of presentation
ewing 's sarcoma ( ews ) is an aggressive osteolytic tumor of bone and rapidly disseminates to other sites .
ews is a primary nonosteogenic malignant tumor of bone with peak incidence in second decade of life .
the case we present here is a 14-year - old female child who presented with low backache since 1 year followed by right eye proptosis for 4 months and swelling over right side chest wall since 3 months [ figure 1a ] .
this case exemplifies the idea that every new lesion in a patient with ews should be considered as a possible metastasis .
it shares the histological features with other malignant small round cell tumors ( msrct ) .
. early and correct diagnosis of ews is essential for clinical management since it belongs to the group of primary msrct .
