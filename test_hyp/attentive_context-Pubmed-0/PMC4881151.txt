the mean preoperative manifest spherical equivalent ( mse ) was 9.98    2.8 d and 9.14    2.4 d in the v4b and v4c groups , respectively ( p  =  0.51 ) , which reduced to postoperative values of 0.24    1.3 d and 0.2    1.18 d , respectively ( p  =  0.09 ) .
anterior subcapsular opacities were present in 6.9% and 3.14% of eyes with v4b and v4c groups , respectively ( p  <  0.01 ) .
the safety indices were 1.11 and 1.14 and efficacy indices were 1.4 and 1.5 in the v4b and v4c groups , respectively , at the end of 9 months . at the end of 9 months , on questioning , the most common subjective symptom reported was glare and haloes in 23% and 25% in the two groups , respectively ( p  =  0.09 ) . however , they were not annoying enough to cause visual disability . due to the large difference in the sample size between the two groups ,
a gain of 1 line of cdva was seen in 10% and 11.76% eyes in v4b and v4c groups , respectively ( p  =  0.08 ) , while no change in cdva was seen in 90% and 88.24% of eyes ( p  =  0.07 ) .
