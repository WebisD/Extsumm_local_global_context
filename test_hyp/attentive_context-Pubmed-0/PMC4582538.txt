the injury was successfully treated by induction of segmental liver atrophy through segmental portal vein embolization and segmental bile duct occlusion.89
this damage might be associated with accidental transection of the duct without identifying that the bile duct was a rare anatomic variant .
we herein present an unusual case of isolated injury of the ras duct following lc .
, our experience from this case and others suggests that percutaneous segmental portal vein embolization followed by intentional clamping of the external biliary drainage can effectively treat intractable bile leaks caused by segmental bile duct injury of various causes , including lc .
a 48 year - old female patient was transferred from another institution due to intractable bile leak after lc .
bile duct injury is the most common lc - associated complication , with an incidence of 0.5 - 1.4% , and it is diverse in terms of extent and location.1234 isolated injury of the right hepatic sectoral or segmental bile duct is an unusual form of major bile duct injury.56 the usual causes of this injury type include direct cutting or clip clamping of the segmental duct , and thermal injury from irrelevant cauterization . variant biliary anatomy such as a low - inserting right posterior duct and other rare variations of segmental duct union with the cystic duct are reported to be important predisposing conditions.7 isolated injury to the right anterior sector ( ras ) following lc is very rare , compared with that of the right posterior sector duct , and its surgical treatment is difficult due to its deep location .
