it has long been a goal of prenatal genetic diagnosis to develop a noninvasive test that would 
 allow for detection of aneuploidy and eliminate the need for invasive testing , such as chorionic 
 villus sampling or amniocentesis .
this review compares 
 the risks , benefits , and limitations of all currently available prenatal screening methods for 
 detection of down syndrome .
as of 2007 , 
 the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists has defined a pregnancy as 
  high - risk  when any of the following criteria are met : family history of 
 aneuploidy , advanced maternal age , abnormal serum screen , or abnormal ultrasound findings.3,4 
 while multiple screening options are currently available , the only diagnostic tests offered 
 prenatally for down syndrome are amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling .
down syndrome is the leading cause of prenatal chromosome abnormalities , accounting for 
 53% of all reported chromosome conditions.2 testing strategies , guidelines , and screening options have expanded from their conception in the 
 1970s . at that time ,
validation studies are currently underway for 
 noninvasive prenatal testing in the detection of fetal aneuploidies in the general population as 
 well as multiple gestations .
while this is still not currently possible , developments in 
 noninvasive prenatal testing are the initial steps in this direction . while the scope of this review 
 does not include other aneuploidy conditions , all of the companies discussed do offer screening for 
 trisomy 13 and 18 , with varying degrees of success .
