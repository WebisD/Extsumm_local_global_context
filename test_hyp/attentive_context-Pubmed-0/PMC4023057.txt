a pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis causing pulmonary hypertension and severe tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed on technetium-99 m ( tc-99 m ) sulfur colloid bone marrow scan and single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect)/ct .
we report the case of a 66-year - old man in whom chest ct scan did not reveal any lung parenchymal abnormality .
a 66-year - old man with a known primary myelofibrosis ( diagnosed in december 2008 at an outside institution ) presented to our hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal bloating in march 2012 .
the causes are multifactorial , with extramedullary pulmonary hematopoiesis being described as a rare etiological factor ( 2 ) .
may be suspected on computed tomography ( ct ) chest scans in the presence of diffuse ground - glass opacities or interstitial thickening ( 3 ) .
this case report highlights the utility of tc-99 m sulfur colloid bone marrow scan in cases of unexplained pulmonary hypertension with underlying myeloproliferative disorders .
we believe that an inclusion of spect / ct imaging helps to confirm and characterize the pulmonary involvement .
extramedullary pulmonary hematopoiesis in myelofibrosis leading to pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation is a rare condition .
