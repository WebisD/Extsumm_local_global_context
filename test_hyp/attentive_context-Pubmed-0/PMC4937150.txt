, we provide the first evidence that ssc - mir-181d is able to target porcine gr 3utr and suppress 
 the luciferase reporter activity in hela cells . in conclusion , we demonstrate , for the first time , that maternal betaine supplementation during gestation 
 enhances the expression of total gr mrna , as well as its exon 1 - 4 and 1 - 9,10 mrna variants , in the hippocampus 
 of neonatal piglets , without affecting the total cellular gr protein content .
alterations of cpg methylation in 
 the proximal region of gr promoter and modified expression of mirnas targeting 3utr of porcine gr mrna appear 
 to be involved in the regulation of hippocampal gr expression .
it is well - documented that gr expression can be modulated by maternal nutritional interventions , such as 
 protein restriction in rats   
 and undernutrition in sheep , as well as dietary supplementation of 
 methyl donors in rats   and in humans .
moreover , infusion of l - methionine diminished hippocampal gr expression in the adult rat 
 offspring of high licking / grooming and arched - back nursing ( lg - abn ) mothers . similarly , maternal dietary supplementation with methyl donor mixture inhibited hippocampal gr 
 expression in three - month - old tame rats . in the present study , 
 however , maternal betaine supplementation increased total gr mrna expression in the hippocampus of newborn 
 piglets .
