the cathode material with li1.5ni0.5mn1.5o4 operates at two different potential plateaus with a specific capacity of 200  ma  h  g. additionally , we demonstrate the first practical application of a lirich li1+xni0.5mn1.5o4 ( 0<x<1 ) cathode in full cells versus graphite anodes , and the cells show very promising stability for the development of nextgeneration highenergy liion batteries .
furthermore , we demonstrated the first application of lirich li1+xni0.5mn1.5o4 ( 0<x<1 ) cathodes in full cells versus graphite anodes , and the cells had a capacity of 160  ma  h  g and a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100  % .
the structural and morphological parameters were optimized to obtain the maximum energy density in cell applications . the optimized architecture in combination with the high density leads to fewer surface side reactions at high potentials .
we successfully synthetized lirich phases with composition li1+xni0.5mn1.5o4 ( 0<x<1 ) , which showed highcapacity and highvoltage performance as cathode active materials for liion batteries ( libs ) .
the li content is optimized to allow very stable cycling behavior in halfcells with highvoltage and highcapacity performance . in the potential range 2.4 to 4.9  v ,
obtained li2ni0.5mn1.5o4 through the chemical intercalation of a second li ion into lini0.5mn1.5o4 by using lii in acetonitrile.17 however , the cycling behavior and stability involving the ni and mn redox reactions were not provided . to the best of our knowledge , the cycling of a chemically synthesized li1+xni0.5mn1.5o4 over a wide capacity range has not been reported . in the present work
