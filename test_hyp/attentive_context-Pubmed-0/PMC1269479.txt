the first report , that by griffiths and coworkers , is a well researched systematic review and meta - analysis of five controlled studies that aimed to compare outcomes in critically ill patients undergoing artificial ventilation who received a tracheostomy early or late in their treatment .
debate regarding the indications , timing and technique for tracheostomy seems to have been raging ever since the procedure itself was first described in ancient egypt .
aco2 = central venous  arterial carbon dioxide difference ; gcs = glasgow coma scale ; hrqol = health related quality of life ; icu = intensive care unit ; mv 
the topic is of global interest , with research from a number of continents published during the past few months .
the hospital and 30-day mortality rates were no different between the two groups , and the risk for hospital - acquired pneumonia was also unchanged .
a recent retrospective study conducted by chia - lin hsu and coworkers   investigated the optimal timing of tracheostomy formation , its impact on weaning from artificial ventilation , and the outcomes in patients in a medical icu at the 1500-bedded national taiwan university hospital .
encouragingly , the majority of these studies reported good hrqol and functional status post - icu , although some discordance was evident , suggesting a change in conceptualization of quality of life following critical illness .
