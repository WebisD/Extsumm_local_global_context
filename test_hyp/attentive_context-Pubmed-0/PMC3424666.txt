more recently , oncogenic activation of k - ras , myc , and b - raf have been shown to activate nrf2 signaling , and this cross talk has been shown to be important for oncogene - induced senescence evasion and tumorigenesis.  for future development of sfn as a chemopreventive or therapeutic agent , we have evaluated the risk of long - term sfn administration on lung tumorigenesis by using oncogenic k - ras mouse model and human lung cancer xenograft mouse models .
our data from three preclinical mouse models of lung cancer suggest that prolonged sfn treatment does not promote tumor growth in mice .
( e ) real - time pcr showing expression of the nrf2-dependent gene , nqo1 , in the liver and tumor tissues.*p < 0.05 ( t test ) to demonstrate that systemic delivery of sfn induced nrf2-dependent target gene expression in mice , we measured nqo1 expression in the liver [ figures 2e and 3e ] .
these findings , along with those from previously published studies on the chemopreventive properties of sfn against chemical carcinogens , support its future clinical development as a drug for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other pulmonary diseases .
