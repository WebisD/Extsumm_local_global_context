the cnt were functionalized by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azomethine ylides using a one - pot functionalization procedure described elsewhere13 leading to the formation of pyrrolidine - type groups bonded to the cnt surface .
graphene layers and their intermolecular interactions were modelled with the mm3 force field that has been found to give accurate intermolecular structures.17 all the calculations were performed with the tinker molecular mechanics suite18 using three - dimensional periodic boundary conditions.19 the shape and dimensions of unit cells containing five functionalized graphene layers with different concentrations of functional groups were systematically obtained by energy minimization .
additional data for the characterization for the gnr : thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) and fourier - transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) , is provided as supporting information .
these solutions were analyzed by uv - visible spectroscopy on a shimadzu uv-240 1 pc , using 10  mm light path quartz cells .
low - magnification tem and high - resolution tem ( hrtem ) images were acquired with a gatan ultrascan 1000  p camera controlled with digital micrograph software integrated in the microscopes user interface .
two types of cnt were investigated , nc7000 from nanocyl and mwnt  sa from sigma  aldrich ( catalog reference 659258 ) , both produced by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) .
