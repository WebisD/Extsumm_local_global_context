in addition , we summarize these findings and discuss tumor suppressor function , as well as the clinicopathological significance of cdh1 in lung cancer .
cdh1 methylation might be a biomarker of lung cancer , with potential value in predicting the prognosis of the disease , and warrants further studies involving more clinical cases for meta - analysis in the future .
three studies investigated the effect of clinical stage , ie , stage i , ii , iii , or iv . one paper discussed lymph node metastasis and another discussed degree of differentiation . analyzing tissue samples from 657 patients and 593 controls , the mean frequency of cdh1 methylation was 32% ( range 8.33% to 66.32% ) in tumor tissue and 9% ( range 0.00%27.78% ) in tissue from controls .
this result indicates that the occurrence of cdh1 methylation is higher in tumor tissue than in normal tissue . using the fixed model , meta - analysis showed that 657 cases and 593 controls from 12 studies were pooled or as shown in figure 2 ( or 3.89 , 95% ci 2.875.27 , p<0.00001 ) .
a study included for meta - analysis needed to have : evaluated the correlation between cdh1 methylation and lung cancer ; included a clinical cohort and controls ; included at least three patients and controls ; used methylation - specific polymerase chain reaction or quantitative methylation - specific polymerase chain reaction to examine cdh1 methylation and expression ; and used tissue data rather than blood data .
