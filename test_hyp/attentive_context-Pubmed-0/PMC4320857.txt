subsequently , the primary aim of our study was to determine whether we could identify , in a group of patients with t2 dm initiated on the glp-1 analogue exenatide , any predictors of response by identifying any differences between parameters in those that achieved the nice required reduction in hba1c ( responders ) and those that did not ( nonresponders )
we hope that our findings reinvigorate this field of research as with supplementary research we can ultimately develop a predictive model which both outlines and quantifies a series of predictor variables and changes allowing clinicians to identify , with a significant degree of confidence , individuals likely to respond to exenatide therapy .
therefore , our study reinforces the utilisation of exenatide as a glp-1 analogue in the management of t2 dm and additionally emphasises the efficacious properties of this glp-1 analogue with regard to improvements in both weight and glycaemic control .
nonresponders were shown to have a significantly greater proportion of participants on exenatide with insulin compared to responders ( 20.4 versus 3.17% , p = 0.0047 ) .
253 individuals were excluded on the basis of incomplete data ( n = 206 ) , prescribed a glp-1 analogue other than exenatide ( n = 46 ; liraglutide = 31 ; lixisenatide = 7 ; prolonged - release exenatide = 8) , or diagnosed with t1 dm ( n = 1 ) .
