the aim of this study was to investigate the long - term linear hygroscopic expansion of resin - modified gics in comparison with those of a conventional gic , a polyacid - modified composite resin and two composite resins .
the resin - modified gics exhibited the highest linear hygroscopic expansion among the materials tested .
photac - fil aplicap showed the highest hygroscopic expansion between the resin - modified cements . the time to reach a constant level
the magnitude of the hygroscopic expansion of specimens which were made using bulk insertion techniques was also investigated .
at one year , however , its linear expansion was significantly higher than the composite resins .
these findings are congruent with the results of the present study where dyract showed a hygroscopic expansion intermediate to that of the resin - modified gics and composite resins
for instance , fuji cap ii , fuji ii lc and tetric achieved the constant length at three months , while this time was six months for photac - fil aplicap and z100 and nine months for vitremer and dyract .
the specimens were removed from the water after 24 hours , one week , one month , three months , six months , nine months and one year following preparation and dried using tissue paper .
