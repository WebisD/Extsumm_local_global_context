alt free flaps are considered reliable options for reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the oral and maxillofacial area .
, we investigated the surgical anatomy of the alt flap in a series of eight cases , focusing on the pattern of perforators and variation in pedicle course compared with previous studies .
cases of reconstructive surgery using alt free flaps were enrolled from the database of all patients who underwent ablative surgery for oral and maxillofacial cancers from 2014 to 2015 in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery in asan medical center ( seoul , korea ) .
( table 1 ) microvascular reconstructions with alt free flaps were performed for all surgical defects in the maxilla ( five cases ) , buccal mucosa ( two cases ) , and floor of the mouth ( one case ) .
lcfas were anastomosed with the facial artery in four cases , superior thyroid artery in two cases , and superficial temporal artery in two cases . in vein anastomosis ,
the mean age of patients was 61 years , and the male to female ratio was 4:4 .
3 ) type i pedicles were present in five patients , and type ii pedicles in three patients who needed intramuscular dissection for flap elevation . however , type iii pedicles , which are reported to occur in 1% to 5% of patients810 , were not observed in the eight cases.(table 3 )
