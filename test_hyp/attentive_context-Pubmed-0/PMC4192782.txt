demographic and basic variables distribution in both groups as has shown in table 2 , the mean and sd of total bilirobin level at the time of hospitalization ( tsb at 0 h ) , 8 h after , 16 h after and 24 h after phototherapy and also at the time of discharge from hospital are given .
according to the findings of this study , the technology used in qhifl can not show the capabilities of the fls
the change trend in the level of total serum bilirobin during the intervention in both groups the average hospitalization duration in fl group was 2  0/58 days and the same was 2/33  0/57 days in the qhifl group , which according to t - test , the mean of hospitalization duration in fl group was lower significantly ( p = 0.047 ) . in figure 2 , the distribution of hospitalization duration is given for both groups .
considering the point that the general aim of this study is to compare the effect of light source in qhifl and fls on the treatment of jaundice for healthy newborns with gestational age of 35 weeks or more and considering the point that the demographic and basic variables showed no significant difference according to age at the time of hospitalization , gender , blood type , rh , age of pregnancy and the first tsb level , therefore these interfering variables are neutralized and the resulting findings are most probably related to the effect of the treatment on the newborns tsb level . although in romagnoli study the speed of reduction of tbs level in the halogen group was meaningfully faster than fluorescent group and as a result the duration of treatment was meaningfully shorter in halogen group and this difference is against the findings of the current study , we should note that in romagnoli , the qhifl light source was directly connected with the skin of the newborn through optical fibers and a pad , whereas in the current study the qhifl light source is placed at the distance of 45 - 50 cm from the skin to avoid hyperthermia .
