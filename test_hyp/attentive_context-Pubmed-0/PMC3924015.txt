pregnancy in patients with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) is rare , and kidney disease before pregnancy is associated with poor fetal outcome .
we present a case of successful pregnancy in an adpkd patient on hemodialysis ( hd ) .
( 3 ) studied fertility and pregnancy complications between patients with polycystic kidneys ( n=76 ) and a control group ( no polycystic kidney ) ( n=61 ) of women at risk of adpkd .
they found no significant distinction between the 2 groups with regard to fertility , spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , or urinary tract infection ( 3 ) .
she delivered a healthy female weighing 2,100 g. one week after delivery , the patient was hospitalized for 5 days because of postpartum cardiomyopathy .
another study showed that overall fetal complication rates were not significantly different between women with and without adpkd ( 4 ) . on the contrary ,
preconception counseling is needed in all women on dialysis because most of the pregnancies reported were unplanned .
she was managed by a multidisciplinary team approach to optimize the patient and fetal outcomes .
the computed tomography scan taken 2 yr ago showed bilaterally enlarged kidneys filled with numerous renal cysts along with only a few liver cysts ( fig .
