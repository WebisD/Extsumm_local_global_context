the aim of this study was to determine how physical ( weight , volume , and density ) and morphological ( md and bl dimensions ) properties affect the fracture resistance of roots , and which criteria are important for standardization in fracture resistance evaluated studies .
this is the first study in the literature to conclude that  the volume or weight of root as the most important determining factors in root fracture. within the limitations of this study , it can be concluded that when forming groups to evaluate fracture resistance , after the root length is standardized , the roots should be equally distributed according to their volumes or weights , rather than their md and bl dimensions , as these dimensions can not closely simulate the entire strength of the root as much as the volume or weight .
the results indicated that volume ( r = 0.427 , p < 0.001 ) and weight ( r = 0.394 , p
< 0.001 ) of the roots had a more significant effect than bl ( r = 0.197 , p = 0.085 ) , md ( r = 0.239 , p = 0.037 ) dimension which implying that volume or weight had greater importance regarding the prediction of fracture strength [ table 1 ] .
