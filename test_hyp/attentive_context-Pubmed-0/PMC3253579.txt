secondly , we assessed the women 's coverage rates with the three components of the who package   for malaria management during the current pregnancy and identify pregnant women characteristics associated with iptsp and itns .
indeed , a similar finding of malaria prevalence at the time of delivery is observed in cte d'ivoire , where vanga - bosson and coauthors report a prevalence of 4.8% of placental malaria , in an area where iptsp coverage rate ( 2 doses ) does not exceed 50%   and , in thailand , where proportion of positive results for p. falciparum in maternal blood and in placental blood were estimated at 3.0% and 3.8% , respectively . in thailand ,
multigravid women , were less likely to use two doses of iptsp ( or = 0.14 ; 95% ci ,   , p < 0.0001 ) and itns ( or = 0.16 ; 95% ci ,   , p < 0.001 ) compared to primigravid women .
the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women in the car ( 2.8% of thick peripheral blood smears and 4.0% of placental slides ) was lower than in other areas of intense malaria transmission , such as gabon , where the rates were 34.4% in maternal blood and 53.6% in placental blood films .
