percutaneous ablation is accepted as the best therapeutic choice for patients with early - stage hcc when resection or transplantation are precluded . on the basis of the current evidence , rf ablation seems to offer higher cumulative survival and recurrence - free survival rates compared with other image - guided treatments and is accepted as the primary ablative modality at most institutions .
hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the fifth most common cause of cancer , and its incidence is increasing worldwide because of the dissemination of hepatitis b and c virus infection15 .
several image - guided ablation techniques have been developed to treat non - surgical patients with hcc .
further trials are needed to establish the clinical value of image - guided ablation in combination with intra - arterial treatments68 .
the system that links staging with treatment modalities in hcc is the barcelona clinic liver cancer ( bclc ) staging system4,5,10 ( table 1 ) .
most patients with hcc , however , have two diseases  liver cirrhosis and hcc  and complex interactions between the two have major implications for prognosis and treatment choice9 .
patients with cirrhosis are at the highest risk of developing hcc and should be monitored every 6 months to diagnose the tumour at an asymptomatic stage68 . in most solid malignancies ,
