europe and asia show similar data   , with a rapid increase in disease burden on society .
early detection of patients at risk and early institution of effective treatment may help to ease the mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease . to achieve this ,
this rapidly growing vesicle technology will hold , in combination with the maturation of the biobanks ( inclusion of patients and secondary events ) in the netherlands and asia , great promise for new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that take ethnicity and gender into account .
this has already resulted in identification of vesicle proteins for the diagnosis of acs   and prognosis of secondary cardiovascular events   in clinical cohorts .
although relatively unexplored due to technical challenges , vesicle proteins hold promise as mass spectrometry - based proteomic technology is rapidly emerging for identification and quantification of extremely low abundant proteins in a sample .
plasma extracellular vesicle proteins are still in the early stage of study , mostly aiming to identify and to characterise the proteomes .
improved early diagnosis in patients with chest pain in or before the emergency department would reduce the burden on the hospitals .
evidence - based therapy of proven efficacy has been introduced over the last 25  years but mortality and readmission rates remain high .
