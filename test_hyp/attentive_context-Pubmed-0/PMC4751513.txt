, we demonstrate how n - induced 
 changes to the fe catalyst phase evolution and composition directly 
 impact the h - bn incubation time and the uptake of b and n species 
 during dosing .
the catalyst bulk 
 prefilling method presented here therefore provides an elegant alternative 
 to using different catalysts or using catalyst alloying to control 
 the permeability of the growth species .
we adopt a simple cvd process , the salient stages of which are 
 outlined in figure 1 : ( 1 ) the preannealing stage , during which the samples are gradually 
 heated in h2 or nh3 , ( 2 ) the vacuum stage preceding 
 borazine exposure , ( 3 ) the borazine exposure period , and ( 4 ) the vacuum 
 cooling stage . figure 2 compares the morphology of the h - bn grown on as - received fe foils 
 ( 100 m ) at 900 c and 6  10 mbar borazine partial pressure following preannealing in 4 mbar 
 of either h2 or nh3 ( stage 1 ) as a function 
 of borazine exposure time ( stage 3 ) .
importantly , given the interdependency 
 of the b and n solubilities , it allows us to lower the permeability 
 of b , which leads to uniform h - bn monolayer growth .
