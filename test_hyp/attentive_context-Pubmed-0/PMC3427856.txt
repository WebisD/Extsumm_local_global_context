we describe a novel twin modeling approach that incorporates spatial information , and the design of the space interactive visual analysis tool that allowed us to collaboratively explore the geocoded twin data , with contributions from geneticists , psychologists , statisticians , clinicians , geographers and teachers .
how should geographical variation in genetic and environmental effects be interpreted ? in some ways ,
such challenges aside , new open - source initiatives such as the r project for statistical computing ( http://www.r-project.org/ ) and the processing visualization language ( http://www.processing.org/ ) mean that it is now possible to construct a purpose - made custom visual analysis tool as part of the analytic process , an undertaking that previously would often have required too great an investment of time and resources to be practical . embedding visualization into our analysis has been crucial to arrive at these insights and connections . by bringing together experts from many different disciplines in the pursuit of a common goal , it revealed patterns that merited further exploration . beyond advancing our understanding of how nature and nurture interact on a national scale in the origins of childhood traits ,
however , making sense of the genetic and environmental etiology of childhood traits and disorders is a complex process that requires input from experts in a wide range of fields , so we sought an approach that could capitalize on this distributed expertise . here
