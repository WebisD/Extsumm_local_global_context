we report our analysis of all potential psvs in the human genome and their correlation with segmental duplications as detected by our blast analysis .
furthermore , we provide a critical assessment on the three latest human genome assemblies from our analysis of sequence misassignments as identified from this study .
another subset is likely to be false ambsnps of genomic sequences that have been misassigned in genome assemblies . here ,
segments of dna with near - identical sequence ( segmental duplications or duplicons ) in the human genome can be hot spots or predisposition sites for the occurrence of non - allelic homologous recombination or unequal crossing - over leading to genomic mutations such as deletion , duplication , inversion   or translocation .
in addition , we have shown previously that there is a strong correlation between ambiguously mapped snps ( ambsnps ) , as well as the density of snps , and segmental duplications .
previous studies to identify segmental duplications in the human genome have analyzed older versions of the genome assembly , which contained higher amounts of unfinished sequence and incorrectly mapped regions , and have used different computational approaches all performed by the same group [ 6 - 8 ] . with the human genome sequence now nearing completion , we have examined its content for segmental duplications using two distinct computational methods . in the first , we utilized the rapid blast2   algorithms that allow direct chromosomal - wide sequence comparisons to be made .
