this study demonstrates the validity of sweat crystal formation test to support a diagnosis of cf in children whenever conventional sweat test is unavailable .
second , this study compared two kinds of test in children whose first presentation was compatible with cystic fibrosis , although this would not be statistically a problem .
therefore , we designed this study to compare the results obtained by these two methods . in this study , 60 children with clinical signs suggestive of cf , who were referred to the children 's medical center , pediatrics center of excellence in iran , were investigated .
comparing these two methods of sweat test showed good positive predictive value of 96.7% and the negative predictive value of 100% with specificity and sensitivity of 96.7% and 100% , respectively .
ideally , a larger and more popular sample size would perhaps delineate more suitable differences between the two methods of cf diagnosis in children with cystic fibrosis .
classic sweat tests ( gibson and cooke sweat test ) and crystallization test were performed for each subject for at least two times in the referral laboratory of the hospital .
comparing these two methods of sweat test showed good positive predictive value of 96.7% and the negative predictive value of 100% with specificity and sensitivity of 96.7% and 100% , respectively .
