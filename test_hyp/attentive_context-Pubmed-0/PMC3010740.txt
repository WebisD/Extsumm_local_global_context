they are as follows : ( i ) the establishment of an epidemiological association between the infectious agent and the immune - mediated disease ; ( ii ) the identification of t cells or antibodies directed against the patient 's target antigens ; ( iii ) the identification of microbial mimics of the target antigen ; ( iv ) reproduction of the disease in an animal model .
in the 19th century , robert koch postulated a causal relationship between a pathogenic microbe and a disease .
this verifies gbs as the first paradigm of an autoimmune disease triggered by molecular mimicry .
is ascertained , identification of its microbial mimics and reproduction of the disease in an animal model remain unresolved .
only the first criterion has been achieved with the association of aidp with cytomegalovirus infection . until the target antigen in aidp
in 1957 , they proposed the fulfillment of several criteria to proof the pathogenic effects of autoantibodies , namely , the direct demonstration of free , circulating , or cell - bound antibodies by indirect means , the recognition of specific antigen against which the antibody is directed , the production of antibodies against the same antigen in experimental animals and finally the appearance of pathological changes in the corresponding tissues of an actively sensitized experimental model that is similar to that in the human disease .
