our analytical strategy can be summarized in the following steps : classify the patient specimens into clades ( a cluster of specimens located on the cladogram ) onto cladogram through parsimony analysis of their gene - expression data ; identify shared genes with abnormal expression ( termed synapomorphies in phylogenetic vocabulary ) for each clade ; and identify genetic pathways affected by abnormal gene expression for all amd specimens and/or for each clade .
parsimony is an evolutionary analytical method that has been applied to mass spectrometry data of cancer , gene - expression of various diseases   , vaccine analysis , and systematics biology of taxa .
further specific objectives of this analysis are to find out if gene expression profiling supports the current classification of phenotypes , to identify the shared gene expression aberrations among amd 's phenotypes , to find out if the transformations in the neural retina are similar to those in rpe - choroidal region , and to carry out class discovery in order to subtype amd on the basis of gene expression profiles and answer whether it is a single disease or different disease entities . to reach the above stated objectives
the transcriptomal changes are very heterogeneous and seem to be mostly patient - specific and involve various signaling pathways . furthermore , the transcriptomal profiles seem to be incongruent with the clinical phenotypes , and the early gene expression events of amd can not be deciphered from the advanced phenotypes of the disease .
