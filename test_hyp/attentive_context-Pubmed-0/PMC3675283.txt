the purpose of this study , therefore , was to measure marginal and internal fit of single , 4-unit , 6-unit zirconia fixed partial denture core which had been fabricated using cad / cam system by using replica technique and to evaluate the effect that span length on fit while evaluating whether measured marginal gap was in clinically acceptable range or not .
mean value of marginal fit was within clinically acceptable range . in 6-unit group , however , some margins showed values that were out of clinically acceptable range . therefore , it was analyzed that the increase of the span length could possibly decrease fit between zirconia core and abutment tooth when fixed partial denture was 6-unit or longer .
change of the span length influenced marginal fit and internal fit to some degree . in single or 4-unit fixed partial denture group ,
between which groups of point 2 , 4 , 7 and 8 showed the difference , post - hoc test was performed using dunnett t3 test ( table 3 ) .
between which groups of point 2 , 4 , 7 and 8 showed the difference , post - hoc test was performed using dunnett t3 test ( table 5 ) . as a result of measuring point analysis which showed statistically significant difference , measurement value increased from single , 4-unit and 6-unit in order in point 2 , 4 , 7 when bucco - lingual analysis was done .
