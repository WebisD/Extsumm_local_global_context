unstable bony and soft tissue mallet injuries of the hallux are uncommon . in this more chronic case in a younger patient with significant retraction of the tendon , we advocate open reconstruction with combined suture anchor repair and k - wire transfixion , with a return to normal functional outcomes and a range of movement .
the  stubbed toe is a common innocuous injury , usually sustained barefoot , which can result in a wide range of injuries including nail bed lacerations , fractures of the distal phalanx and , uncommonly , bony or soft tissue mallet injuries .
the mainstay of management of simple fractures and nail bed injuries is usually non - operative , with good long - term function and little or no morbidity .
mallet fingers are common injuries with well - established treatments depending on the presence or absence of a fracture or joint subluxation . however , similar injuries to the hallux are rare with only a handful of single case report in the literature   .
a 13-year - old girl injured her left great toe while running downstairs barefoot , incurring a forced plantar flexion injury .
owing to their relative rarity , there is no consensus as to the optimum treatment which ranged from non - operative treatment in a rigid soled shoe , closed reduction and stabilization with kirschner wires or open repair and reattachment of the tendon with suture anchors .
