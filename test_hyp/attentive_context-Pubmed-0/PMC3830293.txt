we hereby report a case of patient with primary hypothyroidism presenting with af and pericardial effusion which resolved with levothyroxine therapy .
hyperthyroidism is commonly associated with atrial fibrillation ( af ) , particularly in the elderly .
this is possibly the first reported case of af and pericardial effusion in a case of hypothyroidism .
young patients with no evidence of organic heart disease may be started on a full replacement dose of thyroxine .
although atrial arrhythmias are common and ventricular ectopy is rare in patients with hyperthyroidism , it is rarely associated with hypothyroidism .
patient was treated with levothyroxine which lead to resolution of symptoms and restoration of normal sinus rhythm .
treatment of hypothyroidism is well - documented to cause af due to inadvertent overdosing of levothyroxine .
he complained of chest pain which was substernal , nonradiating , and throbbing in nature .
older patients or those with known or suspected ischemic heart disease , should initially be given about 25% of the anticipated replacement dose , and the dose should be increased gradually at 6 - 8 week intervals .
right atrial and right ventricle showed 30% collapse during diastole , mild left ventricular hypertrophy was present with no regional wall motion abnormalities .
