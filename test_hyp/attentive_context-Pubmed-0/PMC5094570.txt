this paper addresses this problem and deals with the preparation of some sl analogues having a methyl group at c2 of the dring and their bioevaluation .
the sl analogues having either the gr 24 or nijmegen1 basic skeleton and modified drings were readily obtainable by coupling with the appropriate chlorobutenolides modified at c2 .
the coupling protocols with the butenolides shown in scheme 2 can be added to the arsenal of methods for preparing a large variety of sl analogues . it should be noted that the new sl analogues 8a , 8b , 11a and 11b having a methyl group at c2 of the dring , are racemates .
however , for the purpose of obtaining simple and cheap suicidal germination stimulants for use in the field , the procurement of these compounds as racemates is satisfactory .
the biological data reveal that the bioactivity is hardly affected by the methyl substituents at c2 .
the results of the bioassays are relevant for the understanding of the mode of action of sls.23 

. detailed conclusion on the influence of the c2methyl group in the dring on the germination stimulating activity can only be drawn when the respective enantiopure single diastereomers and enantiomers of these analogues are tested .
