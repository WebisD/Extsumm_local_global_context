, our novel findings highlighting efficacy of a fixed low dose of topiramate of 25  mg / day in migraine prophylaxis also attest to advantages in terms of reduced cost and favourable side effect profile .
overall , we found that topiramate significantly reduced headache frequency ( headache days ) comparing baseline to end - point ( wilcoxon signed rank test , z  =  3.47 , p  =  0.001 ) .
however , no significant differences were found for headache duration ( wilcoxon signed rank test , z  =  0.23 , p  =  0.82 ) or severity ( wilcoxon signed rank test , z  =  0.31 , p  =  0.76 ) . in terms of side effects , paresthesia was by far the most commonly encountered in 55% of patients .
to our knowledge , this is the first fixed dose ranging study designed specifically to address this issue employing a simple and straightforward clinical approach . here , we show that a low daily dose of 25  mg of topiramate was equally effective as 50 , 75 and 100  mg in reducing headache frequency .
our findings can be compared to a previous study comprising only chinese patients , which found that some patients appeared to benefit with doses as low as 25  mg / day , despite the mean dose being 80  mg for that entire study which had employed a physician - led upward dose titration depending on clinical response . as the end results of this and our study were contributed by chinese patients ,
