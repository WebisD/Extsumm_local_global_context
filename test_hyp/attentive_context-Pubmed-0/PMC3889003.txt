therefore , practicing ladd 's procedure on asymptomatic patients may put them at risk of complications . here , we report the case of a 37-year - old patient with acute left side appendicitis and asymptomatic mmr .
a 37-year - old man was admitted at the emergency unit of our hospital with acute abdominal pain , which started the previous night .
midgut malrotation ( mmr ) is a congenital nonrotation or incomplete rotation of the primitive intestinal loop around the axis of superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) during fetal development .
volvulus is the main complication of mmr , but the occurrence of acute midgut volvulus of clinical significance in the absence of surgical treatment is unknown .
left side acute appendicitis is extremely rare but can occur with congenital abnormalities with true left - sided appendix such as situs inversus totalis and mmr or as an atypical presentation of a long right - sided appendix , which is thus projected into the left lower quadrant .
however , a dilemma arises when patients are asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed with mmr during another abdominal affection such as appendicitis .
management of incidentally mmr diagnosis during another abdominal affection can be either conservative or not .
