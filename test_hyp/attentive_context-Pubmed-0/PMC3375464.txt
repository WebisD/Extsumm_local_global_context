pten is the one of the most frequently mutated or lost genes in human cancer . given the emerging roles of pi3k in immune system regulation , it is possible that pten is also playing a prominent role in the prevention of autoimmune disease and inflammatory / lymphoproliferative syndromes .
the finding that pten did not play a role in lymphomagenesis in mature t cells from mice which lack pten specifically in t cells suggested that pten has a specific function in preventing lymphoma within a distinct time frame in this compartment .
it will be important to determine which biochemical requirements pten fulfills in each stage of protection , and whether these requirements are distinct within different stages from cells of the same lineage , or whether lack of particular features leads to different outcomes depending on developmental stage . given the importance of pi3k signaling in both normal immunity and the development of cancer , it will be interesting to see how closely pten s role as a lipid phosphatase is tied to prevention of disease , and how integral pi3k signaling remains throughout disease progression . uncovering the specific biochemical functions of pten within these contexts will be key to the development of targeted therapies for the prevention and treatment of t cell malignancies and autoimmune disease .
