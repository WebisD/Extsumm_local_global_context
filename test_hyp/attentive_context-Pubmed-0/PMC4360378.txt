herein , we report the identification of multiple chemotypes 
 (  chemical structural motifs  ) that showed publication - quality 
 ic50 values in our primary assay but through a series of 
 orthogonal assays and counter - screens showed thiol - reactive assay 
 interference and also promiscuous enzymatic inhibition . using sir 
 and structure  activity relationships ( sar ) from our rtt109 
 post - hts triage , along with multiple analytical techniques , we provide 
 evidence supporting several chemical mechanisms of assay interference 
 relating to thiol reactivity .
the growing use of high - throughput screening 
 ( hts ) as a discovery tool in academic translational centers has resulted 
 in the pursuit of assay artifacts , promiscuous bioactive compounds , 
 and screening actives with major absorption , distribution , metabolism , 
 excretion , and toxicological ( admet ) liabilities .
it is hoped that the identification and detailed characterization 
 of these thiol - reactive chemotypes can accelerate post - hts triage , 
 enhance lead identification , and prevent follow - up on unpromising 
 chemical matter by other researchers .
we highly recommend 
 the problematic chemotypes described in this report be pursued as 
 chemical leads with high levels of skepticism and that investigators 
 currently working with these compounds carefully re - evaluate the interpretation 
 of their results when there are claims of biological utility , including 
 apparent enzymatic and cell - based selectivity , bioactivity , and mechanism - of - action 
 studies .
