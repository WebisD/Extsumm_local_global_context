our purpose was to combine the results of the mdct morphological data and the spect data using hybrid imaging to overcome the limits of the mdct in the evaluation of coronary stenosis in diabetic patients with large amount of calcium in the coronary arteries .
therefore , the usefulness of the fusion between ct and spect images is to overcome the limits of ct and the limits of spect with a high diagnostic accuracy , especially in patients with high cardiovascular risk and high presence of physical limitations , like the diabetic patients .
of 324 coronary arteries and corresponding areas , the hybrid spect / ct evaluation showed 92 ( 28.4% ) of areas with hypoperfusion and 232 ( 71.6% ) with normal perfusion ( table 2 ) .   in the first group of 52 ( 16% ) coronaries with significant stenosis at ct and perfusion defect at spect , hybrid images demonstrated a hypoperfusion ( figure 1 ) . in the second group of 228 ( 70.4% ) with nonsignificant stenosis at ct
between january 2009 and december 2011 , we enrolled 120 consecutive diabetic patients ( 84 males and 36 females ) , mean age 67 years old ( range 5078 ) , and performed a coronary ct .
