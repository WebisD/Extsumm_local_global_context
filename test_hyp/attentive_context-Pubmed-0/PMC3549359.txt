this paper used a novel approach to gathering descriptive epidemiologic statistics on cancer by combining information from the biomedical literature , internet - based query systems and reports , and direct contact with cancer registry representatives and key experts to provide the most up - to - date , comprehensive picture of a particular malignancy type .
this paper highlights the importance of international coordination between cancer registries ( e.g. , haemacare ) to promote standardization in data collection and reporting .
in addition , gaps were identified that highlight the need for more detailed reporting to cancer registries and the importance of developing assumptions to estimate the burden of specific b - cell malignancies in the interim .
we also briefly describe our findings of the descriptive epidemiology of b - cell malignancies .
this novel approach provided a more comprehensive database of the current patterns of b - cell malignancies compared with a simple literature search .
the intent of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of this novel approach for assembling a database of descriptive statistics and to broadly assess the level of detail collected by cancer registries worldwide .
, comprehensive approach to gathering descriptive , epidemiologic statistics was used to develop a current worldwide database of the major b - cell malignancies .
