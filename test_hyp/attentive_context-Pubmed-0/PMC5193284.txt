marks ( 2015 ) review and analysis significantly advances the understanding of the obesity epidemic by ( a ) identifying the factors that could be at the origin of weight gain and clarifying how they contribute to the obesity epidemic ; ( b ) highlighting the distinction between factors that contribute to initial weight gain , as well as to the processes involved in the circle of discontent ( cod ) ; ( c ) describing the psychological and health problems that result from weight gain and obesity and ( d ) proposing prevention strategies .
we propose that an important aspect of fighting obesity is determining the psychological factors that explain why some individuals may be less susceptible to the processes described in marks theory and how this relates to their motivation to regulate their eating behaviours ( patrick and williams , 2012 ; pelletier et al .
in summary , although we commend marks for the contributions to the obesity literature , we highlight three points that should be considered when attempting to explain and propose solutions for the obesity epidemic . greater emphasis
should be placed on the role the individual plays in regulating their own eating behaviours , with less responsibility attributed to external sources , in order to facilitate feelings of self - control and accountability .
