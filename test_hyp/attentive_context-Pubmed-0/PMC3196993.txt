tobacco smoking is the strongest risk factor for pancreas cancer , but the mechanism of disease causation has not been elucidated although the various steps in the sequence of development of the malignancy have been described  beginning from pan - in 1 to invasive adenocarcinoma .   on a background of this recent meta - analysis summarising the evidence linking tobacco use with pancreatic cancer , we have reviewed the available laboratory and experimental data , providing a summary of the current knowledge of tobacco - driven pancreas carcinogenesis .
there is compelling epidemiological evidence for a disease - causation effect for this which is backed up by physiological evidence based on laboratory studies on subcellular fractions , cell lines derived from human and animal models of the disease , whole animal models and human studies .
established medical databases including pubmed , medline , scopus , and index medicus were searched for a variety of different combination of the terms pancreas , pancreatic , cancer , adenocarcinoma , tobacco , use , smoking , and carcinogens to identify peer - reviewed publications exploring the relationship between tobacco smoking and pancreas cancer . after excluding duplicate results , a total of 235 publications were initially identified .
