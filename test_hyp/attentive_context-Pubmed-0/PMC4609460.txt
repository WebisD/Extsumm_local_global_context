this diversification of harm reduction programmes in combination with efforts to improve access to highly effective hcv treatment could make further progress in reducing hcv prevalence and incidence .
the priminject study was carried out using the internet to reach current or former injectors and obtain descriptions of circumstances , behaviours , and potential exposure to blood - borne infections at the time of injection initiation . launched within the context of changing trends in substance use , drug policy , and drug supply , priminject was the first study to describe new injectors and the circumstances surrounding their first injections over time .
the aim of this exploratory analysis is to examine injection risk behaviours and correlates at the time of initiation into injection drug use among individuals who began injection in the post-2000 era in france .
the context of new patterns of drug use and emerging new consumer profiles among young people presents new challenges for harm reduction among young people .
the outcomes of interest were two injection risk behaviours : ( 1 ) receptive needle sharing , defined as injection with a syringe previously used by another person at first injection , and ( 2 ) receptive sharing of other injection equipment , defined as using a cooker or cotton filter previously used by another individual .
