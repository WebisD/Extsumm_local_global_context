we will introduce our series about the functional and clinical outcome after decompressive craniectomy to control refractory high icp due to non - traumatic acute stroke in pediatric patient .
between march 2004 and december 2006 , decompressive - hemicraniectomy and duroplasty was performed in 5 toddlers and preschool children with non - traumatic , malignant refractory high icp .
in this study , we describes the young pediatric patients have undergone decompressivehemicraniectomy for a non - traumatic acute hemispheric stroke .
however , there has not been a definite evidence or standard guideline for decompressive craniectomy for pediatric patient with non - traumatic acute stroke with uncontrolled refractory high intracranial pressure .
it also shows that decompressive hemicraniectomy can be lifesaving and can besafely performed in toddler and pre - school children . and young children can get a survival and relatively independence and family satisfaction.decompressive hemicraniectomy
stroke is rare in children , however , a common cause of neurological disease , and it is a major cause of death ranks in the top ten in pediatric period11,15 ) . documented incidence has been reported as 2.5 - 8/100000 children / year12,13 ) .
should be considered as an alternative therapy for patients with life - threatening brains welling refractory to medical management .
