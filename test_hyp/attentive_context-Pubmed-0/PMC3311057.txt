the principal challenges in drug development for cns  hiv infections are : ( 1 ) understanding the pathways for viral entry , replication , reservoirs , and glial activation in order to identify new targets for treatment , ( 2 ) developing selective therapeutics agents for those targets , or shaping effective strategies to deliver them within the cns , and finally but not to underestimate ( 3 ) collaborating with pharmaceutical companies to test promising drugs in clinical trials , and eventually exploit them in clinical practice .
the central nervous system ( cns ) represents an important target for hiv infection during multiple stages of the disease : early , after invasion of the host , since the virus rapidly enters the cns , which then constantly acts as a viral reservoir ; lately , subverting its function and causing peripheral neuropathies and neurocognitive disorders ; and lastly , during the final stage of neuroaids , triggering opportunistic cns infections , cancers , and dementia ( tardieu and boutet , 2002 ) .
highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) , a combination of drugs that inhibits enzymes essential for hiv replication , can reduce the viremia and the onset of opportunistic infections in most patients , and prolong the survival ( see table 1 ) .
