we believe that dcc is an optimal alternative on standard technique because permits the total removal of tumor involving both skull and dura structures , minimizing tractions on the underlying brain and permitting the direct vision during the dissection .
we describe a technique where the tumor involving the bone is before left in situ , normal dura is exposed around the tumor , and the tumor can be afterwards removed en bloc with direct vision and minimally traction of the brain surface .
the removal of a tumor involving the skull and the intracranial space could present a technical challenge , especially if the tumor has a dural and/or brain attachment . with a standard craniotomy , the maneuver of separating the intraosseus portion of the tumor from the intracranial portion might produce hemorrhage , traction and injury to the underlying brain .
bloc excision is mandatory but can represents a real technical challenge , expecially if tumor involves both the skull and the dura .
the aggressive surgery that is needed in these cases could bring a large bone defects to fill .
although radical excision of tumor involving the skull is the gold standard of oncological treatment , elevating a bone flap when the tumor involves both the skull and the dura could be very hard and represents a technical challenge . with a standard craniotomy
