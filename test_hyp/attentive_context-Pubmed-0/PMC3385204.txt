we report a case of post - abortion sea caused by the bacteroides fragilis group , which was managed successfully with antibiotics and surgical drainage .
a 30-year - old woman was transferred to our hospital for fever and posterior cervical pain .
spinal epidural abscess ( sea ) is a rare severe infection and accounts for 2.53.0 cases per 10,000 admissions in general hospitals .
early imaging could play a crucial role in the treatment of sea , and a careful history taking and physical examination could allow detection of the infectious source . although the use of prophylactic antibiotics in intrauterinal procedures and in cases of incomplete abortion is controversial at present , further clinical trials to assess the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis after d and c for abortion is necessary should be considered .
bacteremia occurs in approximately 5% of the patients who undergo d and c , and progresses to intrauterinal abscess in most cases .
micro - organism in vagina might reach cervical discs through hematogenous spreading from pelvic venous plexus ( batson 's plexus ) and cause spondylodiscitis and sea in early days .
in our case , d and c for incomplete abortion might have caused transient bacteremia resulted in spondylodiscitis and hematogenous sea .
