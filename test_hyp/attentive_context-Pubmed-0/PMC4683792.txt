we present a case of single coronary artery from right sinus with left main coronary artery originating from the same ostium , which underwent successful angioplasty with stenting to right coronary artery through the radial route .
some single coronary ostium variants have been reported to carry a significant risk of severe cardiac events including myocardial infarction ( mi ) and sudden cardiac death , especially during exercise .
left main coronary artery arising from the right sinus of valsalva as a single coronary ostium is an extremely rare anatomic anomaly occurring in approximately 0.06% of angiographic series .
2 ) ct 3d reconstruction is a useful tool to understand the ostial configuration and course of anomalous coronary .
the present case merits mention because of several points : 1 ) intervention in a single coronary artery through radial approach has been rarely reported and in type r ii , it is all the more rare .
a 60-year - old male was referred to our tertiary care institute for coronary angiography .
single coronary artery is encountered more frequently with other congenital cardiac malformations such as persistent truncus arteriosus , tetralogy of fallot , transposition of the great arteries , or pulmonary atresia .
