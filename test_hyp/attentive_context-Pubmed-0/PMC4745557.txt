the objective of the present study was to determine the physicochemical properties of fatted and defatted gums from chia ( salvia hispanica ) seeds .
the partly defatted chia gum showed a very good ability to water holding ( 110.5  g / g ) ; however , their ability of oil holding ( 11.67  g / g ) and water absorption ( 36.26  g / g ) was minor compared to the fatted chia gum , which provided a greater retention of oil holding ( 25.79  g / g ) and water absorption ( 44.08  g / g ) .
rheological behavior of gums was shear thinning or pseudoplastic type . from a functional point of view
, chia gum also is an important food ingredient due its emulsifier and stabilizer potentials .
the results obtained here show that chia gums present interesting physicochemical properties for the food industry .
the proximal composition ( table 1 ) showed that pdcg registered a higher content of protein , ash , and nfe than fcg .
the protein content of both gums was higher than registered in corn gum ( 5.1% ) and mesquite gum ( 5.8% ) , this last one with important emulsifying properties attributed to its protein content according to bosquez . in this respect ,
