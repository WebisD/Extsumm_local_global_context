the percutaneous absorption of two formulations , lip and mm , was evaluated , as was that of co and pa textiles impregnated with the same lip or mm .
ga was absent in the receptor fluid of both lip - treated textiles and in the mm - treated pa ; it was only detected in the mm - treated co fabric and in a smaller amount than that in the free formulations .
this methodology may be useful to verify the penetration through human skin of encapsulated substances applied to textile materials , which can be considered as strategic delivery systems for the release of a given active principle at specific doses in the skin .
two textiles , co and pa , were chosen to compare the roles of two vehicles , two phospholipid structures ( lip and mm ) composed of the same phospholipids but with a surfactant in the case of mm .
a similar penetration profile was obtained for the textiles treated with ga in mm or lip in the different skin compartments .
the aim of this work was to determine ga penetration from different biofunctional textiles within the layers of the skin using a specific in vitro percutaneous absorption method .
