the postseismic free - air gravity changes from viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip are similar at the scale of 500  km commensurate with the grace data resolution . however ,
grace data recorded postseismic increase of the gravity field by 6 galviscoelastic relaxation and afterslip were examined with the gravity datathe grace data constrain the biviscous rheology model for the asthenosphere grace data recorded postseismic increase of the gravity field by 6 gal viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip were examined with the gravity data the grace data constrain the biviscous rheology model for the asthenosphere
the bouguer gravity responses are distinct ; the bouguer anomaly of viscoelastic relaxation is positively correlated with the free - air anomaly , while the bouguer anomaly of afterslip is negatively correlated . the broadscale postseismic gravity observation and the local subsidence measurement above the rupture zone
grace observed postseismic gravity increase by 6 gal ( 4050% of the coseismic gravity change ) within a couple of years after the 2011 tohoku - oki earthquake .
large - scale monitoring of the postseismic deformation ( gravity as well as vertical displacement ) will help characterize the rheological properties of the earth 's interior that may lead to a better understanding of increased seismic hazard following great earthquakes .
