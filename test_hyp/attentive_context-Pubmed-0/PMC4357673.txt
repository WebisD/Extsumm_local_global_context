an hiv - negative male , in his sixties , originally presented with a 6-month history of an isolated large nodule on the right malleolar region which was confirmed as kaposi 's sarcoma ( ks ) on excision .
intralesional doxorubicin was very successful in this case and the persistent remission induced would suggest that doxorubicin might be equally or even more effective than other standard intralesional treatments for ks cutaneous lesions in selected cases . further studies with a large cohort of patients could be helpful to clarify the impact of intralesional doxorubicin in ks .
ks is an angioproliferative disease associated with human herpesvirus 8 . the classic variant of ks is characterised by a low mortality and significant morbidity , and treatment needs to be finely balanced between these two aspects . to date
it represents a particularly effective treatment for widespread ks as it accumulates in highly vascularised lesions .
, a curative treatment has yet to be found and therapeutic management includes surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy or a combination of all of the above .
therefore , in the following order , we tried two courses of photodynamic therapy , imiquimod 5% cream applied once daily for 8 weeks and a cycle of anti - herpes therapy based on valganciclovir .
