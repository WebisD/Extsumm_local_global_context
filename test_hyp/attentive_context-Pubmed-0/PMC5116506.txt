these findings are in contrast to the positive association reported between cutaneous hpv infection , measured by hpv serology and presence of hpv in eyebrow hairs , and scc  
, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the association between cutaneous hpv infection at the time of scc diagnosis in the parent study with the risk of subsequent scc .
infection with cutaneous hpv was assessed using three biomarkers : serum antibodies to hpv , presence of hpv dna in eyebrow hairs , and presence of hpv dna in scc tumors .
seropositivity to cutaneous hpv infections , overall , by genera and beta hpv species , was not associated with the risk of subsequent scc ( table 3 ) .
it is important to identify factors predisposing to recurrent and second primary sccs to guide development of better follow up protocols , characterize high risk sccs , and inform preventive strategies aimed at reducing the morbidity associated with subsequent sccs . in this retrospective cohort study , while no association was observed between cutaneous hpv seropositivity and the risk of subsequent scc , a significantly inverse association was observed between cutaneous beta hpv infection in eyebrow hairs detected at the time of index scc diagnosis and subsequent scc development , among scc cases with hpv dna positive index scc tumors .
