, we evaluated the candidial / streptococci carriage and the various species of candida / streptococci isolated from the down syndrome patients and correlated it with normal oral micro flora from health subjects .
fifty down syndrome individuals were selected for this study based on a karyotype of 47 xx , 21 + ( female ) and 47 xy , 21 + ( male ) . a total of 50 normal children / adolescents were selected as a control group . to isolate candida and streptococci , swab / saliva
hence , to improve the quality - of - life of an individual with down syndrome , it becomes necessary to diagnose and treat these infections when they still remain localized .
the down syndrome subjects run a greater risk of having opportunistic infections with a possibility of systemic spread , and the associated morbidity and mortality is also higher .
comparison of candidal and streptococcal growth patterns in study group and control group candidal and streptococcal colonization was seen in 14 ( 28% ) individuals in the study group and 6 ( 12% ) individuals in the control group .
the present study determined the prevalence of oral candida carriage in down syndrome children and adolescents .
