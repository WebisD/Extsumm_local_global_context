we now define a unique role for the mzmo in regulation of mzb retention and activation and show that movement of this subset of macrophages to the red pulp of the spleen involves signaling via sh2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase 1 ( ship ) and bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( btk ) .
in addition , we show a direct interaction between mzmos and mzbs via the marco receptor on mzmos and a ligand on mzbs .
blood - borne pathogens first encounter the adaptive immune system in the marginal zone region of the spleen where the convergence of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms insures an early and effective response to pathogen antigens ( 1 , 2 ) . both thymic - independent and -dependent responses are elicited in response to infection ( 1 , 3 ) . the thymic - independent response involves the targeting and activation of marginal zone b cells ( mzbs)*through their interaction with the repetitive antigenic determinants of pathogens with complement and b cell antigen receptors ( 4 , 5 ) . in contrast , the thymic - dependent ab response is driven by the interaction and reciprocal stimulation of apcs , t lymphocytes , and b cells .
