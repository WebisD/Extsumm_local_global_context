, we described an easy transoral endoscopic removal of adenoidal tissues aiming to assess the efficacy of this method in relieving the obstructive nasal symptoms .
however , we strongly advise randomized trials to compare this method with other methods regarding the operative time , the amount of intraoperative blood loss , the postoperative complications , and the incidence of recurrent symptoms . in conclusion ,
transoral endoscopic adenoidectomy is the recent advancement of classic curettage adenoidectomy with good direct vision of the nasopharynx that enables the surgeon to avoid injury of important structures as eustachian tube orifices and also gives him the chance to completely remove the adenoidal tissues .
three - hundred patients were included in this study , all had adenoid ( with or without tonsillar ) hypertrophy .
the study sample ( n = 300 ) had a mean age of 4 years and 4 months at the time of the adenoidectomy . no cases presented with postoperative complications such as hemorrhage , airway problems , grisel 's syndrome , stenosis , or velopharyngeal insufficiency . telephone questionnaire showed recurrent obstructive symptoms in one case only ; the child and his parents were invited for assessment .
