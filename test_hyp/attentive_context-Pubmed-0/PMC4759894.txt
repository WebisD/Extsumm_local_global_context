a number of surgical techniques have been described for the repair of iridodialysis.245678 we describe a novel 
cobbler 's technique  for repairing iridodialysis in the right eye of an 18-year - old patient .
functional symptoms , such as glare and monocular diplopia , result from the polycoria of a pseudo - pupil created by the iridodialysis .
following peribulbar anesthesia , a fornix - based localized conjunctival peritomy ( 611 oclock ) was performed in the right eye of a patient with traumatic iridodialysis extending from 7 oclock to 10 oclock position in the inferotemporal quadrant [ figure 1 ] .
iridodialysis commonly occurs secondary to blunt ocular trauma,1 penetrating ocular trauma , and intraocular surgical procedures . in the cases of small iridodialysis
the advantages of  cobbler 's technique  for repairing iridodialysis as described above include : ( 1 ) it is performed through a small paracentesis wound ; ( 2 ) the anterior chamber remains stable throughout ; ( 3 ) multiple sutures can be passed without withdrawing the needle from anterior chamber ; ( 4 ) large dialysis can be repaired easily ; ( 5 ) the shape of the iris can be controlled ; ( 6 ) only one suture knot is required at the end of the incision which can be easily be buried within the sclera groove minimizing the likelihood of late suture erosion . our novel  cobbler 's technique  for iridodialysis repair allows a maximally functional and cosmetic result .
