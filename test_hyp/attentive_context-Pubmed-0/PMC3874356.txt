the aim of this prospective substudy was to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the recovery of functional immunity ( t - cell function ) with a drv / r - based regimen in a subset of patients from the grace study .
grace ( gender , race , and clinical experience ) is the largest arv trial to focus on women with hiv-1 in north america and was designed to assess sex - based and race - based differences in efficacy , safety , and tolerability of the pi darunavir with low - dose ritonavir ( drv / r ) plus an optimized background regimen over 48 weeks in a diverse , treatment - experienced patient population .
this grace substudy demonstrates that drv / r - based therapy improved cd4 + cell recovery and was associated with progressive functional immune recovery over the 48-week study period .
as expected , based on results from previous studies   , drv / r - based therapy resulted in increases in cd4 + cell counts and decreases in cd8 + counts in virologically suppressed patients , with an improved cd4+/cd8 + ratio .
in addition , we found that drv / r - based arv therapy was associated with progressive functional immune recovery over 48 weeks in virologically suppressed patients , as demonstrated by improved lymphocyte response to mitogens and recall antigens .
