proposed mechanism for the ni - catalyzed cycloaddition 
 of diynes and tropone . in conclusion , we have discovered a nickel catalyst that 
 can effectively and selectively incorporate a single c  c -bond 
 of tropone in the cycloaddition with diynes .
simple enones 
 are known to undergo ni - catalyzed cycloaddition with diynes ( eq 2 ) .
it involves a unique 8 insertion of tropone to 
 form the observed major and minor products .
thus , we focused our investigation on discovering 
 an alternative ni - catalyzed cycloaddition protocol.2 diyne 1 and tropone a were used 
 as model substrates and were subjected to a catalytic amount of ni(0 ) 
 and a variety of phosphine and n - heterocyclic carbene 
 ( nhc ) ligands ( eq 4 ) .
the mechanism of 
 this novel cycloaddition reaction has been investigated using dft 
 calculations .
the mechanistic studies 
 to further understand this unique reactivity of tropone and application 
 of this chemistry are underway in our laboratories .
the lack of general methods to access troponoids prompted 
 our investigation on the ability to convert the cycloadduct to a fully 
 aromatized product .
due to the uncertainty of the catalyst , we did not perform 
 computational studies on the isomerization of the tricyclic product vii .
