marinederived fungi and bacteria constitute a promising source of unique metabolites with considerable pharmaceutical and therapeutical potential .
the importance of natural product discovery from microorganisms started only after the largescale production of penicillin ( 1 ) during world war ii ( numbers 1101 in bold refer to chemical structures 1101 at the end of this article ) .
examples mentioned in this review include the potent ptp1b inhibiting activity of aquastatin a ( 101 ) which may be a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity , as well as the carcinogen metabolizing enzymes modulatory activity of chromanone a ( 100 ) , which could be helpful in preventing the initiation stage of carcinogenesis .
natural products research still has an enormous unexploited potential , and the significant advantages and disadvantages of natural productderived molecules as drug candidates for development have been highlighted in numerous articles ( rogers , 2004 ) .
the discovery of compactin and mevinolin enabled the development of the highly successful statin therapeutics ( 4 ) ( endo , 1992 ) , which even today are considered as block buster in pharmaceutical sales . the discovery of streptomycin , gentamicin , omegamycin ( 5 ) and other antibiotics pushed the pharmaceutical industry to implement large research and developing programs based on natural product discovery , with a recent emphasis on marine microbial fermentation based technologies .
