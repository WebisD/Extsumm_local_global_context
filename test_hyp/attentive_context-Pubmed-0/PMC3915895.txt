the study demonstrates that output from ftir and gcms can be simultaneously analysed using a common signal processing approach for evaluation of thermally degraded vegetable oils .
, we report a synchronised signal processing algorithm that caters both ftir and gcms signal for evaluation of thermally degraded vegetable oils .
numerous algorithms have been developed for analysis of signal from various instrumentation techniques , that is , fourier transform infrared ( ftir )   , gas chrnomatography - differential mobility spectrometry ( gc - dms ) , gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms )   , high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , two - dimensional gas chromatography ( gc - gc ) , and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( lc - ms )   to allow mathematical integration of the signals including baseline correction , smoothing , and peak deconvolution on a personal computer .
this has motivated the development of a signal processing approach that aids in analysis of signals from multiple sources . in this paper
undoubtedly , the approach is not a perfect and flawless method as there are possibilities that peaks are overlooked or mismatched ; nevertheless , it offers a systematic strategy to process relatively large datasets of edible oils from gcms and ftir simultaneously with reasonable reliability .
