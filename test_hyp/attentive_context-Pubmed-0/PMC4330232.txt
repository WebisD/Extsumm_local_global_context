 primary or secondary neurondocrine ( ne ) tumours of the female genital tract are rare .
however , some points should be taken into account when imaging studies are performed : cervical small cell carcinoma and ovarian carcinoid are the most common gynaecological ne tumours.cervical small cell carcinomas usually behave aggressively.ovarian carcinoids tend to behave in a benign fashion.while managing an ovarian carcinoid , extra - ovarian extension , bilaterality and multinodularity should raise the suspicion of metastatic disease.endometrial ne tumours are very rare and are usually small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma with ne differentiation.as for other tumours , us , ct , pet - ct and mri remain the most commonly used imaging tools , but octreotide scans may be useful for typical and atypical carcinoids .
