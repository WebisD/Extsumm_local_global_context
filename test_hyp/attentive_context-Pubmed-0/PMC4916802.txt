the aim of the current study is to evaluate the presence of aclas in tobacco users and non - tobacco users with severe chronic periodontal disease
this warrants further longitudinal studies with large sample size to investigate the relationship between coronary heart disease and smoking with severe periodontitis .
the results were statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) in smokers in severe periodontitis subjects when compared to non - smokers .
igg levels were significantly increased ( mean difference of 9.14000 ) compared to igm levels ( mean difference of 8.52050 ) in severe smokers .
results of the current study showed that smokers [ table 1 ] with severe periodontitis exhibited marked increase in acla igg , igm compared to non - smokers .
it was noted that igg , igm levels were increased in smokers compared to non - smokers .
anticardiolipin antibodies igg , igm levels in smokers and non - smokers with severe periodontitis results were analysed using independent student 's t - test [ table 2 ] .
quantitative analysis of igg , igm aclas in smokers and non - smokers with severe chronic periodontitis .
