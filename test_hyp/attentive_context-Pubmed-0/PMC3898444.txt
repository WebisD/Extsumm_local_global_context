this is an interventional study , conducted to examine whether resistance exercise training with thera - band tubing increases muscle mass in 50-year - old women .
thus , matched for weight and age , 20 women , randomly assigned into the control ( n = 10 ) and resistance training groups ( n = 10 ) , completed the study .
our findings showed that 12 weeks of resistance training with thera - band tubing significantly improved muscle function and enhanced strength and muscle endurance in postmenopausal women , whereas four weeks of detraining caused significant reduction in the muscle strength . in this study
mamc , ffm , trunk flexion , and extension decreased and skinfold thickness ( triceps , subscapular , and suprailiac ) [ figures 13 ] ; percentage of body fat , and weight of body fat increased in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) [ table 2 ] .
subjects characteristics at baseline , after resistance training , and after detraining effects of resistance training on physical measurements mean  s.d for age and height in the c group was 56.7  3.9 years , 155.9  7.3 ( cm ) and for the rt group was 54.4  4.7 years , 157.0  6.6 ( cm ) , respectively .
