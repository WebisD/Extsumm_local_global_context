the objective of this paper is to review the current literature and to discuss evidence on clinical , paraclinical , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) markers as predictors of disability progression in ms .
multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a chronic idiopathic disorder of the central nervous system ( cns ) sustained by a multifocal inflammatory process predominantly affecting myelin - sheathed axons .
given that ms is mostly diagnosed in subjects in the third and fourth decade of life , the availability of reliable predictors of long - term prognosis is extremely important .  
although a considerable level of international agreement has been reached on methodological requirements of mri studies in ms , an effort is being made by the csf markers research community in order to standardize collection and biobanking of samples from well clinically characterized ms patients to develop reproducible laboratory assays for csf analysis and to find common definitions of healthy and diseased controls   . to identify reliable prognostic markers , future ms
conversely , mri and csf parameters , which can be classified as biomarkers as they express more closely biological mechanisms underlying the disease pathophysiology , have a good potential of quantitative assessment as well as variation according to disease stage . considering the complex pathogenesis of ms
