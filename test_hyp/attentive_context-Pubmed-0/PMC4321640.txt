there have been a few reports of successful slow pathway ablation in patients with dextrocardia , but usually at the expense of prolonged procedure and fluoroscopy times.37 to our knowledge , slow pathway ablation of a patient with dextrocardia due to pulmonary agenesis has not been described to date .
radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway is considered to be the gold standard treatment for patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( avnrt ) .
pulmonary artery agenesis is a rare anomaly that may occur during embryological development of the heart.1 this agenesis may be accompanied by a complete or partial absence of the lung . in the great majority of the cases , the diagnosis is usually made at or soon after birth and it can be associated with multiple anomalies .
a 35-year - old woman was admitted to our cardiology clinic with complaints of palpitation . she had a 7-year history of paroxysmal palpitations . the tachycardia , at a rate of 170200 bpm ,
as such , we did not need an additional catheter in this ablation procedure , but an additional catheter might further facilitate the procedure . we are presenting this pulmonary agenesis case in view of its atypical presentation in adulthood , which is exceptionally rare . as demonstrated in this case , revealing cardiac anatomy by contrast injection or other imaging modalities may shorten the procedure time and decrease the complication rates .
