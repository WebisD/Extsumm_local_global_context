neuroendocrine tumors ( nets ) comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that are frequently metastatic at the time of diagnosis , and distance of metastatic disease is , next to grading , one of the most important prognostic factors ( 1)(3 ) .
the following investigations are also required : ( a ) immunohistochemical markers and detailed histological analysis ; ( b ) assessment of the primary tumor and the extent of extrahepatic spread by imaging , including patterns of hepatic metastases ; and ( c ) biochemical assessment of functionality and general tumor markers .
molecular imaging is in its early stages and has the potential to be a significant tool in the management of patients with nets .
the frequency of metastatic disease varies depending on the type of tumor , but in specialized centres , 8090% of patients who present with small intestinal nets ( carcinoids ) and 6070% of patients with pancreatic nets have liver metastases .
has been reported to be both a diagnostic marker and an early marker of recurrent disease .
the availability of modern imaging methods for diagnosis and staging of nets has improved at the same time as the spectrum of therapeutic options in the management of metastatic disease has increased during recent years .
