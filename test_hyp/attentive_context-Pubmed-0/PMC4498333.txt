the complex pathways involved in neurodegenerative disorders , should be evaluated with care , in the attempt to extend the current understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases and identifying targets for intervention . to be suitable for use inneuroregenerative therapy , the mechanisms that govern the self renewal capacity of mscs
the aging process is associated with a number of structural , biochemical , functional and neurocognitive changes in the brain .
therefore , given the involvement of these factors ( and in particular of oxidative stress ) in the development of neurodegenerative / age - associated diseases , it becomes of primary importance to also gain more insights on the underlying mechanisms triggered by these stressors , as this could serve to improve current therapeutic strategies based on the use of mscs to treat neurodegenerative conditions .
schematic representation illustrating some of the most common risk factors that contribute to the onset and/or progression of neurodegenerative diseases and the related mechanisms driving the neurodegenerative process .
telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of aging and cancer by maintaining genome integrity , controlling cell proliferation , and regulating tissue homeostasis .
in fact , strategies to prevent telomere loss or to increase telomere length of mscs may prevent or delay degeneration and hence the onset of symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders , improving the results of mscs - based therapetic approaches .
