therefore , the goals of this study were to evaluate volume - based care for women with uterine cancer aged 50 years and younger using a statewide population database .
the information obtained in this study increases our current knowledge of volume - based care of young women diagnosed with uterine cancer and may be useful in developing strategic planning in order to improve the care offered to this population .
those that were managed by high - volume surgeons were more likely to have longer hospitalization stays ( p = 0.003 ) and higher adjusted cost of hospital - related care ( p < 0.0001 ) ( table 3 ) .
50 years of age and younger , those admitted to a high - volume hospital were more likely to have higher adjusted cost of hospital - related care ( p = 0.01 ) ( table 4 ) .
no difference was observed among groups in terms of access to high - volume centers ( 52.0% versus 54.0% , p = 0.22 ) . in the subgroup of women
younger women were more likely to have shorter length of hospitalization stay ( p < 0.0001 ) and lower adjusted cost of hospital - related care ( p = 0.0002 ) .
