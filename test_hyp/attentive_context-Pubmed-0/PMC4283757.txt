the importance of fish as a rich source of essential fats , crucial for brain development and cognition , is highlighted in the implementation of the scaling up nutrition framework and roadmap [ a private and public sector and civil society partnership that seeks to better understand the crisis of undernutrition in early life ( first 1000  days ) and elevate nutrition on the global agenda ; http://www.scalingupnutrition.org ] .
a growing body of research studies shows the importance of fish in the supply of not only protein but also more importantly of essential fatty acids and micronutrients ( kawarazuka & bn , 2011 ) .
discussion of the rise of aquaculture has largely focused on its contribution to global aquatic animal food supplies , largely ignoring the resultant changes in species composition of the fishes consumed or how it is farmed and the consequences for food and nutrition security ( kawarazuka & bn , 2010 ; unhrc , 2012 ) .
this paper focuses on fishes that account for two - thirds of gross global aquatic animal source food supplies , and make particular reference to africa and asia .
satisfying the food and nutrition needs of the growing population , let alone its demands , is likely to require a profound change in what and how much is eaten , and where and how food is produced .
