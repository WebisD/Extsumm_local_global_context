this rare condition potentially signifies an unstable cervical spine . we will report a case of congenital isthmic defect of cervical spine and describe a cause of cervical isthmic defect , diagnostic radiographic finding and appropriate treatment of cervical spondylolysis or spondylolithesis
cervical spine spondylolysis is the most commonly caused by high energy trauma to the upper cervical spine in the form of a " hangman 's " fracture of c2 vertebrae7 ) .
a 23-year - old female suffered from a hyperextension injury to cervical spine after a traffic accident . following this injury , she experienced mild to moderate degree of nuchal and back pain .
however , congenital cervical spine spondylolysis is discovered by incidental radiographic finding , neck pain after minor trauma , a clunking or clicking neck and rarely neurologic compromise1 - 3,6,8,10 ) .
plain radiograph of the cervical spine showed bilateral pars interarticularis defect at the c6 level with cleft - bow - tie configuration , hypoplastic pedicle , grade i spondylolisthesis of c6 on c7 and spinal bifida at c6 ( fig .
1 ) . computed tomography of the c6 vertebrae showed bilateral corticated defects of the c6 articular mass , bilateral hypoplastic pedicles , lamina and spinal bifida of c6 and apparent neural foraminal enlargement at c6 - 7 ( fig .
