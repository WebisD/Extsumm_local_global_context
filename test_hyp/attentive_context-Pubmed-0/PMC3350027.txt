here we evaluate whether secondary hypertrophy of the ion leads to contralateral svv tilt indicating hyperactivity of the contralateral dn in line with the current understanding of the guillain  mollaret triangle .
it suggests that over - excitation of the dn by disinhibition of the ion can result in functional impairment of estimating the direction of gravity . in short , inhibition of the dn ( e.g. , by an ischemic cerebellar lesion including the dn ) leads to svv tilt away from the affected dn ( baier et al . , 2008 ) and over - excitation of the dn  as reported here  leads to svv tilt toward the affected dn .
hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus ( ion ) is an interesting phenomenon as it reflects a secondary response to an interruption of afferent connections resulting in increased and abnormally synchronized neuronal activity ( best and regehr , 2009 ; shaikh et al . , 2010 ) .
herein we report on a patient with hypertrophy of the ion secondary to ponto - mesencephalic hemorrhage and a change in the perception of earth - vertical over time .
in this case report we describe for the first time a significant shift in the internal estimate of direction of gravity associated with hypertrophy of the ion .
