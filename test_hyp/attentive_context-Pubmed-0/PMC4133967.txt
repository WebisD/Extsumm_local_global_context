we evaluated the performance of different grades of filters in a modeling analysis , and we identified filters performing at an approximate merv12 rating to be effective at reducing airborne asthma triggers by at least 50% . despite the widespread and common use of media filters in forced air ventilation systems , an analysis of their efficacy that reflects a distribution of real - world emission and household scenarios has not previously appeared in the literature to our knowledge .
the goal of the current work was to assess whether readily available in - duct filtration in the form of better performing filters can have a measurable impact on reducing asthma triggers in the home .
asthma interventions are and should be multi - factorial , and the evidence in our article suggests that in - duct filters could be an important , relatively low - cost component of efforts to reduce allergens in homes .
a large and growing fraction of the us homes have forced air ventilation systems , providing potential low cost opportunities to reduce airborne asthma and allergy triggers .
millions of people in the us , particularly children , have a current diagnosis of asthma , resulting in large health care costs as well as missed work and school days .
