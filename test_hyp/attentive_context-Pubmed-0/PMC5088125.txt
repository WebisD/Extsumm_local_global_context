the aim of this study was to verify the effects of 10 weeks of 
 nordic walking , nordic walking + isa method , walking alone , and walking + isa method on 
 upper limb circumferences and total body water of breast cancer survivors
nordic walking has been reported to 
 achieve balanced postural changes in breast cancer - related treatment postural disorders10 , increases in upper extremity 
 strength8 , improvements in 
 cardio - metabolic and respiratory measures and has been used in the prevention and treatment 
 of upper limb lymphedema . however , in order to elicit beneficial effects , it is necessary to 
 perform the proper technique and achieve consistency in training .
after meeting the medical eligibility criteria , the participants were randomly 
 assigned to one of four different workout groups , which performed nordic walking ( nwg ) , 
 nordic walking + isa method ( nw - isag ) , walking ( wg ) or walking + isa method ( w - isag ) 
 workout . before starting 10 weeks of supervised training , both nwg and nw - isag
