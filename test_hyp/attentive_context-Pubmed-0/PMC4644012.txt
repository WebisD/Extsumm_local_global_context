p dagmatis can cause severe animal - associated infections in humans , mainly in immunocompromised individuals . to our knowledge , this is the first systemic p dagmatis infection reported in canada .
clinical outcomes rely on early accurate laboratory confirmation and timely administration of effective antibiotic treatment . conventional identification of p dagmatis using vitek 2 can be misleading , probably due to the absence of this organism from the database ; 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and maldi - tof ms systems represent excellent options for identifying rarely encountered or difficult to identify organisms , such as members of the pasturellaceae family .
misidentification may have contributed to an underestimation of the frequency of this organism in clinical samples ; however , the growing use of maldi - tof ms systems for microorganism identification in routine clinical microbiology laboratories may allow for a more accurate picture of how frequently p dagmatis causes infections .
correct identification is important for diagnosis and therapeutic management , and epidemiological monitoring of the transmission of pasturella species , particularly for the systemic infections such as in the present case .
this organism has been isolated from both dogs and cats as normal flora , and also reported as a pathogen in human infections .
