out of 363 allograft biopsies received between january 2012 and december 2013 , 24 diagnosed as fsgs were included in the study .
we analyzed 24 graft biopsies with fsgs and tried to etiologically classify them basing on the accompanying morphological features on the graft biopsies and clinical features .
an attempt was made to etiologically classify these lesions as there is a difference in treatment and prognosis .
it is important to diagnose the condition adequately and promptly to protect the graft and inhibit the progression of the disease .
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) is a pathological term to indicate glomerular lesion associated with various etiological factors . in native kidneys ,
this criterion and an available diagnosis of native disease are helpful in diagnosing recurrent disease . in our series , all the four cases had a biopsy diagnosis of fsgs .
causes included chronic humoral rejection in seven cases ( 38% ) , cni ( cyclosporine and tacrolimus ) toxicity in six cases ( 33% ) , and in long - standing grafts with hypertensive nephron loss and hyperfiltration injury in five cases ( 29% ) .
