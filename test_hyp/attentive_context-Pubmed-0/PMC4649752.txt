persistent left superior vena cava ( plsvc ) is a congenital but benign vascular anomaly   with a prevalence of 0.3 - 0.5% in the general population .
although plsvc is a rare congenital anomaly , some risks including thrombosis and occlusion should be annotated when the patient receives a cvc insertion . the relationship between csa and plsvc remains unclear ; however , the hematologist should pay attention to the malpositioning of the cvc tip .
nevertheless , coronary sinus atresia ( csa ) due to plsvc is a rare complication . in patients with hematological malignancies ,
considering such a situation , it may not be advisable to insert a cvc in a plsvc patient with a hematological malignancy .
the insertion of a central venous catheter ( cvc ) is required for the patient to undergo intensive chemotherapy .
hematologists must make a decision whether to conduct a cvc insertion for patients with a given complication .
some researchers have called attention to the risk of atresia of the coronary sinus among the anomalies associated with plsvc , but there are no recommendations regarding anticoagulation therapy for patients with plsvc .
the placement of a cvc might evoke arrhythmia due to an additive enhancement of the patient 's arrhythmogenic condition .
