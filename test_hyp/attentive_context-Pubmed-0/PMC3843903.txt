we report a rare association of unicentric castleman 's disease with secondary ( aa ) amyloidosis .
castleman 's disease is a rare b - cell non - clonal lymphoproliferative disorder first described over 50 years ago characterized by its variegated presentation .
this case is unique in that extensive , diffuse amyloid deposits were observed in the liver with cholestatic jaundice .
it is also the first reported case where secondary amyloidosis failed to regress even after removal of the primary trigger , the focal castleman 's tumor .
the degree of regression of amyloidosis itself is often contingent upon the variant of castleman 's disease , with surgical excision of the primary tumor in a unicentric variant being potentially curative   .
the patient was discharged to be readmitted only 2 weeks later with recurrent ascites from decompensated liver disease .
a 51-year - old african - american man who had been born and raised in the united states first presented to the medical clinic with complaints of generalized weakness , fatigue , unintended weight loss , anorexia and progressively worsening abdominal distension of 3 months duration .
his clinical condition rapidly deteriorated with superimposed severe metabolic acidosis resulting from acute renal dysfunction .
