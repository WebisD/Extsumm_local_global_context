kartagener 's syndrome ( ks ) is a subset of a larger group of ciliary motility disorders called primary ciliary dyskinesias ( pcds ) .
that early diagnosis is important for the preservation of pulmonary function , quality of life , and life expectancy in this disease .
it is a genetic condition with an autosomal recessive inheritance , comprising a triad of situs inversus , bronchiectasis and sinusitis .
nearly 50% of pcd patients have situs inversus . such cases of pcd with situs inversus are known as kartagener 's syndrome .
although siewart first described this condition in 1904 , it was kartagener who recognized the etiological correlation between the elements of the triad and reported four cases in 1933 . the estimated prevalence of pcd is about 1 in 30,000 , though it may range from 1 in 12,500 to 1 in 50,000 . in ks , the ultrastructural genetic defect leads to impaired ciliary motility which causes recurrent chest , ear / nose / throat ( ent ) , and sinus infections , and infertility .
pcd is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous condition wherein the primary defect is in the ultrastructure or function of cilia .
