in conclusion , the recovery time of hearing and thus the survival of hearing loss in the nonoperated ear is usually less than 72 h. following drilling in mastoidectomy , hearing loss , especially at frequencies higher than 2000 hz , may occur that is mainly temporary and reversible , leading to complete recovery after 72 h. the clinical impact of drill - induced hearing loss varies .
the present study aimed to assess hearing threshold recovery in the contralateral healthy ear after acoustic trauma following mastoid surgery .
mean hearing loss threshold pre- and postoperation difference ( db ) of patients , according to the frequencies in pta pta = pure - tone audiometry ; sd = standard deviation with regard to the patients feelings regarding changes in hearing level , the similarity in hearing levels before and after surgery at 24 h , 48 h , 72 h , and 96 h after surgery was reported in 17.9% , 35.7% , 46.4 , and 96.4% of cases respectively .
some patients with a small amount of hearing changes are completely asymptomatic , while others complain of tangible effects . explaining this recovery time to patients helps alleviate the anxiety after mastoidectomy procedures .
