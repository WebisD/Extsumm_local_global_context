we concluded that gay , lesbian , and bisexual males and females fare poorly with regard to healthy lifestyle behaviors , as compared to their heterosexual peers .
, we suggest that efforts be undertaken by schools and communities to modify and prevent unsuitable lifestyle behaviors among lgb adolescents , using social and health education programs that specifically target this group .
using one - way anova , we found that males showed significant differences by sexual identity group for frequency of smoking ( p = 0.029 ) , alcohol consumption ( p < 0.001 ) , muscular strength exercises ( p = 0.020 ) , and walking for at least 10 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) .
the most notable finding in the current study was that 887 adolescents ( 7.5% of the sample ) had some same - sex romantic or sexual experience , such as kissing , fondling , or sex .
the results of the present study support these previous findings , in that gays , lesbians , and bisexual adolescents of both genders had higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption than heterosexual adolescents did .
