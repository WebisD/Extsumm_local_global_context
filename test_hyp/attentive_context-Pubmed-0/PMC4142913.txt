defining cancer stem cells and their origins is of much controversy , and constitutes a challenged knockout for cell targeting- anticancer drugs .
, we assume that characterizing and investigating the most primitive forms of the bone marrow progenitors is required ; both inside their niche and in circulation of cancer patients .
herein , we put forward a hypothetic model for cancer stem cells initiation from bone marrow stem cells .
these later , will differentiate into an ancestral progenitor that activates a memorial program - the black box cassette- that is responsible of abnormal neo - organogenesis in the form of tumors and metastases . to approve this model
, we suggest that fine - tuning of cells ' depicting techniques toward the characterization and isolation of the most primitive forms of cancer patients ' bmscs , into both bone marrow niche ( aspirates ) and the circulation ( blood and lymph ) , is necessary .
, we hope to highlight relevant opinions dealing with the possibility that bone marrow progenitors did initiate the cancerous transformation .
garraway and sellers ( 2006 ) have developed a model of aberrant lineage ontogeny and somatic genetics , in order to explain the chronological evolving of the disease .
