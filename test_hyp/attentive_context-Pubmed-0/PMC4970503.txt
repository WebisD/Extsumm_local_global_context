we review recent published literature in order to identify the epidemiology of patients and characteristics of swallowed and aspirated dentures , and propose strategies to minimise these risks .
further research involving prospective study of large groups of patients after denture fitting , and guidelines in denture design which aim to minimise the risks and mitigate the damage caused by swallowed and aspirated dentures are required .
types of participants / population the patients in the case studies had all experienced an event of swallowing or aspirating a dental prosthesis .
the development of a reporting system would assist in identification of cases , and identification of higher risk denture designs .
thirdly , all patients , regardless of comorbidity , are at risk of aspirating a swallowing a denture , and fourthly that inclusion of clasps does not appear to statistically increase the morbidity caused by the denture .
data extraction and data items data were collected using a specially designed data extraction form on : 1 ) the circumstances of the event , 2 ) any patient factors identified in the case study which may have contributed to the event , 3 ) the presenting symptoms of the patient , 4 ) the design of the denture ( material , clasps , maxillary or mandibular ) , 5 ) the anatomical position at which the denture got lodged , 6 ) whether the denture caused perforation of the viscus , 7 ) the procedure required to remove the impacted denture .
