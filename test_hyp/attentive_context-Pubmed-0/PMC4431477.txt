was associated with 104.6  29.7 cm increase in lav ( p = 0.001 ) . to evaluate the effects of potential confounders , multivariable regression models with age , ethnicity , gender , af duration , type of af , bmi , height , left ventricular ejection fraction , history of valve disease , history of antiarrhythmic drug use , and history of hypertension were utilized .
the r between rs1003464 and rs2200733 in our cohort was 0.003 . in 44 ( 46% )
we further examined this finding by a nonparametric bootstrap method.11,12 this method confirmed that the magnitude of association of homozygosity for the t allele at rs10033464 with lav withstands resampling ( 91.9  38.2 cm , p = 0.016 , table 4 ) and that the finding is unlikely to be incidental .
we also observed that variation at both rs10033464 and rs2200733 was common in our cohort of patients with drug - refractory af referred for catheter ablation . in our cohort ,
model 1 controlled for demographic features such as age , ethnicity , and type of af . as illustrated in table 3 , the magnitude of association for homozygosity at the t allele at rs10033464 with lav was unchanged at 104.4  31.6 cm , and statistical significance was maintained ( p = 0.001 ) . in the fully adjusted model 2 , the magnitude of association of homozygosity at the t allele at rs10033464 with lav and statistical significance
