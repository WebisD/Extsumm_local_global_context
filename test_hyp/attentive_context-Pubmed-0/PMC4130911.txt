this in vitro study aimed to compare the frictional forces of polymer- and rhodium - coated wires with those of uncoated wires in various angulations between the brackets and the wires , using self - ligation brackets ( clippy - c , tomy inc . ) and round and rectangular wires .
the frictional forces of coated wires are equal to or higher than those of uncoated wires
. however , the conditions in the oral cavity are very different from laboratory conditions because of the various tissues involved in oral functions , such as chewing , swallowing , and speaking , as well as the oral tissues that are in contact with the orthodontic appliance . additional research on friction using conditions similar to those in the oral cavity will be needed to produce findings that have a clinically meaningful impact . in addition , to make the proper choice of coated wires , increased understanding of many factors such as abrasion resistance , discoloration , and compatibility with the teeth in the oral cavity , as well as frictional forces , is needed .
the control group , p group , and r group had gradually increasing kinetic frictional forces ( p < 0.05 ) . when the angles between the brackets and the wires were 5 and 10 , the kinetic frictional forces were not significantly different between the control group and the p group ( p > 0.05 ) , but they were significantly greater in the r group compared to the two other groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
