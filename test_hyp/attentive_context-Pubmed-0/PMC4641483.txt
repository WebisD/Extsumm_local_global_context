for the first time , we report the cases of three patients with similar genetic characteristics diagnosed with aml m5 according to the fab classification , who underwent rapid and transient sr .
ever since the generalization and rapid start of induction chemotherapy after acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis , sr has been very rarely observed . in particular , aml with monocytic differentiation ( aml m5 ) represents the largest subgroup of aml with spontaneous remission reported in the literature , with seven cases published since 1980 17 but the existence of a link between aml m5 and sr remains elusive .
spontaneous remission ( sr ) is a rare but well - documented event with hundreds of cases published to date . despite reported cases and progress of conventional cytogenetic and molecular biology ,
the natural history of acute myeloid leukamia ( aml ) is typically unfavorable with rapid progression leading to death in the absence of specific therapy .
a better understanding of this rare process could uncover new potential therapeutic targets for acute leukemia .
sr is an exceptional phenomenon , often transient and relatively well documented but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown . npm1-mutated aml m5 patients who developed spontaneous remission after antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenia present at diagnosis seem to form a subtype with favorable prognosis and chemo sensitive disease .
