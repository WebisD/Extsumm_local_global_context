we hereby describe a young girl who developed lesions of lichen planus pemphigoides ( lpp ) over preexisting atrophic scars , an example of  wolf 's isotopic response .  to the best of our knowledge , such a clinical presentation of lichen planus ( lp ) pemphigoides is not documented yet in the english literature .
the term  isotopic response  connotes the occurrence of a new skin disorder at the site of another , unrelated , and already healed skin disease . since the introduction of this phenomenon in dermatology , a variety of dermatoses
an 18-year - old girl presented with multiple itchy hyperpigmented papules and plaques , along with intermittent blisters over the lower limbs and buttocks for last 3 months [ figures 1 and 2 ] .
lpp has been reported in association with keratoacanthoma and colon adenocarcinoma . a unilateral presentation has also been reported .
the occurrence of a different or unrelated dermatological disease at the site of the healed disease is termed as an isotopic phenomenon .
thus , in conjunction with the clinical , histopathological and dif findings , the final diagnosis for our case was lp pemhigoides developing over preexisting scars , as an isotopic phenomenon .
