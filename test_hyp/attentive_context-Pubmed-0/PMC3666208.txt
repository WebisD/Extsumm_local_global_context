therapeutic high intensity focused ultrasound ( hifu ) or focused ultrasound ( fus ) is a noninvasive medical treatment that allows the deposition of energy inside the human body .
insightec manufactures the exablate2000 which uses mri for extracorporeal treatment of uterine fibroids ( fda - approved ) with significant success , and extensive current research focuses on investigating its application in other parts of the body   .
the sonalleve hifu / mr is an mr compatible device developed to examine a series of applications as fibroids and other body sites .
the device has been used for the treatment of neuropathic pain essential tremor and there is also evidence of possible application for brain tumours   .
exablate technologies are used for prostate cancer or bone metastasis ( exablate 2100 conformal bone system ) ; these applications are currently under development by insightec .
mri and sonography are the two imaging modalities currently being used for guidance and monitoring fus therapy .
overall mrgfus drug delivery is a novel and valuable tool to increase drug targeting and tissue specific drug delivery .
monitoring using real - time imaging , such as with sonography ( diagnostic ultrasound ) , ensures that the targeting of the fus beam is maintained on the correct area throughout the procedure .
