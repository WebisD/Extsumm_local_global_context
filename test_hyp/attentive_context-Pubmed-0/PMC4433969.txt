the cacr group showed before and after test changes ( p<0.05 ) in the 
 frontal lobe ( fp1 , fp2 and f4 ) and the parietal lobe ( p3 and p4 ) , but no notable changes 
 were observed in control group .
however , only a limited number of studies have 
 investigated the effectiveness of brain wave changes and cognitive improvements using this 
 training method to treat stroke patients . this study aimed to determine the most effective 
 treatment method for clinicians in the cognitive rehabilitation field by investigating the 
 changes in stroke patients brain waves , memory and attention elicited by cacr , and the 
 manner in which these changes affect daily life .
the study participants were chosen from among thirty stroke patients who were hospitalized 
 and receiving occupational therapy and physical therapy at a general hospital in kyeongki 
 province between december 2013 and january 2014 .
