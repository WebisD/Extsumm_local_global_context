the main purpose of this study was to describe the cytological features of cptc and compare the findings with other thyroid lesions with cystic change .
in conclusion , the cytologic differentiation of cptc from cystic adenomatoid nodules was very difficult .
small clusters with scalloped margins , cellular swirls , and clusters with a cartwheel pattern were seen only in cptc , which helped to differentiate cptc from adenomatoid nodule .
mesothelial - like cells and hemophagocytic cells were seen in a few cases of cptc .
fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) has become a useful , safe , and accurate tool for diagnosis of thyroid lesions .
a 30-year ( 1980 - 2013 ) retrospective review of the cytology slides from our cytology division of pathology department revealed a total of 750 ptcs . out of these
the main cytologic findings of 73 cases of cptc were as follows : isolated plasmacytoid cells ( 71 , 97% cases ) ( which showed deep basophilic dense cytoplasm and dusty chromatin ) , and some of them showed cytoplasmic vacuolization ; signet - ring formation ( 65 cases , 89% ) ; cytoplasmic blebs ( pseudopods ) ; intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions ( 42 cases , 57% ) ; and nuclear grooves ( 46 cases , 63% ) [ figure 1a and b ] .
