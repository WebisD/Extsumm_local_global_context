disruption of the proximal ligament from its foveal insertion can lead to druj instability accompanied by ulnar - sided pain , weakness , snapping and limited forearm rotation.23 several authors have performed open repair of tfcc foveal tear as a mainstay of treatment.45 although they reported favorable clinical results , arthroscopic assisted repair has been recently advocated as an alternative because it is less invasive.6 this study investigates the clinical results in patients with tfcc foveal tears who underwent arthroscopic assisted repair and describe a modified technique ( a knotless suture without bone tunnel ) of arthroscopic reattachment of avulsed tfcc foveal tears .
based on the vas for pain , there was a statistically significant improvement in postoperative pain compared with preoperative pain ( from 5.3 to 1.7 ) ( p = 0.003 ) .
arthroscopic repair of the tfcc foveal tear is a good modality in the management of druj dynamic instability providing satisfactory pain relief and functional improvement .
the flexion extension ( p = 0.088 ) and radial - ulnar deviation ( p = 0.228 ) did not change significantly , while the range of pronation supination of the forearm increased significantly ( p = 0.04 ) .
