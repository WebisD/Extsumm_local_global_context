lts play important roles in both th1 and th2 immune responses , which are involved in the defense against protozoan and helminth infections , respectively . in light of the current research on the role of lts in infectious diseases
, we have divided the current review into two sections focusing on ( 1 ) protozoan infection and ( 2 ) helminth infection .
lts are associated with the control of helminth and protozoan infections through their ability to modulate inflammatory processes and/or to promote direct cytotoxicity of protozoans . in addition , lts may also be associated with exacerbated pathogenesis in protozoan diseases , such as cerebral malaria , and helminthic diseases , such as schistosomal granulomas .
leukotrienes ( lts ) , first described by samuelsson 's group   , are a class of lipid mediators involved in several diseases but classically known for their effects on asthma and allergy .
lt receptors and 5-lo are expressed mainly in immune cells , and lts play important roles in innate and adaptive immune responses and are involved in several inflammatory and infectious diseases   .
in addition , immunodeficient individuals , such as hiv patients , are characterized by low lt production , which has been associated with impaired immune responses and infection control .
