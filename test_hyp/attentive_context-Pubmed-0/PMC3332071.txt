we present an initial strategy for minimizing the effects of these signals which may be instructive for designing other near - field imaging systems , including simulations confirming the earlier theoretical discussion and validating our feedline design strategy .
the potentially debilitating effects of unwanted multipath signals is a critical consideration in translating near - field microwave imaging approaches into clinical and commercial systems . for our noncontacting antenna approach ,
we demonstrate cases from our current imaging system , where the measurements indicate corruption of the desired signals from multipath signals associated with the base of the tank .
when the imaging tank is deep and the transmitting / receiving antenna tips are sufficiently far above the tank base , the surface wave signals are adequately suppressed relative to the transmissions through tissue .
surface waves ( relative to signal reflections from the imaging tank walls ) appear to cause the biggest effects as they propagate along the outside of the transmitting coaxial line across the illumination tank floor and back up the coaxial feed lines of the receivers .
it should be noted that these investigations have stemmed partially from our efforts to perform microwave tomographic images on patients in an actual mr scanner for the purpose of exploiting the refined spatial resolution of the mr along with the more specific nature of the tissue dielectric properties .
