both the one - dose mosfet and the mobile mosfet are suitable options for measuring skin dose for total body irradiation treatment .
the result showed that there was no significant difference between the 2 systems ( one - dose mosfet dosimetry and the mobile mosfet ) measurements of skin dose at the treatment of tbi as compared to the prescribed dose .
both systems can provide valuable skin dose information in areas where the treatment planning system may not be accomplished , such as for tbi .
the system is controlled by remote dose - verification software running on a personal laptop . the present study aimed to compare the target prescribed dose to the dose that is the measured by onedose mosfet detector and mobile mosfet dosimetry in order to determine which system is superior in monitoring and measuring the tbi doses .
it is necessary to monitor the skin dose and in the meantime to ensure accurate dose delivery to patients , determined by using selected points in the patient s body for verifying the accuracy in delivering of the prescribe dose .
however , for the mobile mosfet measurement of the 10 selected anatomical sites , the percentage mean difference between the measured dose and the prescribed dose for the neck area ( right and left ) decreased by 1% and 0.7% , respectively . in the lung area ( right and left ) the percentage mean difference between the measured dose and the prescribed dose decreased by 1% and 2% , respectively .
