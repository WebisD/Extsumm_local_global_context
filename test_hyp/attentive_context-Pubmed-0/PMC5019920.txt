therefore , the aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency and its effects on bmd in egyptian children presenting with forearm fractures .
this study demonstrates that vitamin d insufficiency / deficiency is common among middle eastern children .
the mean z - score in cases was 0.19  1.99 and 0.3  1.04 in the controls group ( p = 0.3 ) .
overall , half of the participants in the study had suboptimal or low intake of vitamin d and ca . however , 30% of the subjects in the cases group reported low vitamin d and ca intake compared to 4% in the controls group ( p  0.05 ) .
we hypothesize that egyptian children with forearm fractures have lower serum 25-hydroxy - vitamin d levels and bmd z - scores compared to children without forearm fractures .
the single patient in the controls group that had severe vitamin d deficiency had a z - score of 1.9 .
children with fractures had statistically significant lower serum ca values ( p  0.05 ) and higher serum alp levels when compared with the controls group ( p  0.05 ) .
vitamin d measurements ranged from 1.3 to 100  ng / ml with a mean of 38  ng / ml . our study had one patient that was vitamin d deficient and eight patients with severe vitamin d deficiency .
