this provides an opportunity for scientists to examine alternative approaches to disease causation and treatment that are not being currently used in western hospitals .
the chinese tradition is that the chinese ancestors used plants as medicines since the beginning of human existence .
it is very fortunate that chinese and chumash healing have produced theories of disease causation that differ from western theories .

the chinese have empirically and quantitatively observed patients and have formed theories that are useful in curing disease .
although the times of the various crossings remain a subject of research and debate , it is clear that humans have been in the americas for tens of thousands of years ( 2,3 ) .
