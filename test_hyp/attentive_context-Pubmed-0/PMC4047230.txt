 < 0.05 ) ( table 3table 3 .
the present study verified 
 that in individuals with flatfeet , the abductor hallucis muscles affected descent of the 
 navicular bones by inducing blockage16 
 and fatigue of the tibial nerves17 .
the kinds or directions of loading change the 
 distribution of pressure delivered to the center of the body and the feet , which may trigger 
 abnormal gait by causing fatigue fracture or affecting muscle activity or postural 
 alignment9 , 10 . based on the fact that individuals with the flatfeet more easily 
 feel muscle fatigue of the lower extremities and have a higher risk of damages to the 
 musculoskeletal system than individuals with normal feet , the aim of this study was to 
 examine differences between flatfeet and normal feet while subjects walked on an ascending 
 slope like when climbing a mountain .
the subjects in the present study , people with normal feet ( n=15 ) or flatfeet ( n=15 ) , were 
 between the ages of 21 and 30
