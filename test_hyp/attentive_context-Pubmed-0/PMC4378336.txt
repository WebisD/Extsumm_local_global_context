quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) has been performed to determine the expression of these mirnas . for mapping the identified mirnas , genome of vitis vinifera
the current study has employed the deep sequencing strategy in an attempt to effectively identify conserved and novel jute mirnas .
this set of experimentations for identification of mirnas and their potential targets can initiate further study on understanding the mechanisms of regulation of jute mirna .
while a large amount of mirnas are reported and deposited in databases from different plants , mirna associated research in jute is still to be instigated . without the genome sequence of jute at hand , identification of mirna and their targets in jute by deep sequencing of small rnas
discrepancies in the expression pattern of some mirnas found by deep sequencing and qpcr can be attributed to practical differences between the sensitivity and specificity of these two techniques . the sensitivity and large dynamic range of next generation sequencing ( ngs ) , along with its consistent prediction of fold changes when compared with gold - standard qpcr , support its use for discovery - oriented and exploratory mirna profiling experiments   . to evaluate and outline a putative function for a mirna in plants ,
