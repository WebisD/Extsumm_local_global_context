ischemic damage to the biliary tree is a serious complication in liver transplantations .      in this special issue ,

				
				  a number of diseases affect the biliary tree ( cholangiopathies ) , though the pathological mechanisms involved and the anatomical level of the biliary tree affected vary . for example , small interlobular bile ducts are mainly affected by a th1-dominated microenvironment and cell - mediated immune response in pbc , while a th2-dominated microenvironment and increased numbers of regulatory t cells are the major features of igg4-related sclerosing cholangitis which affects mainly the extrahepatic bile ducts .
cholangiopathy with respect to genetics , pathogenesis , and pathology will be discussed in detail .
herein , the anatomy and physiology of the biliary tree , basic injuries to biliary epithelial cells , basic forms of bile duct damage , and etiological classifications of cholangiopathy are reviewed .
the anatomy and physiology of the biliary tree , basic injuries to biliary epithelial cells , basic forms of bile duct damage , and etiological classification of cholangiopathy were reviewed .
bile ductules are very reactive anatomical elements in the liver , and proliferating bile ductules are reportedly involved in the fibrous progression of various chronic liver diseases and are easily identifiable by immunostaining of biliary cytokeratin ( ck 7 and 19 ) .
