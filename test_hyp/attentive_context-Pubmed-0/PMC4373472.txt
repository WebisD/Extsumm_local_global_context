we have demonstrated that participation in the healthy outlook service of the met office reduces hospital admission rates for patients coded on discharge with a primary or co - morbid diagnosis of copd .
paired t - tests of the admission rates for heart failure and myocardial infarction in the year before the start of the service resulted in a mean difference between the two groups of 0.01 ( 95% confidence interval ( ci)=0.08 to 0.07 ; p=0.9 ) for heart failure and 0.02 ( 95% ci=0.09 to 0.05 ; p=0.6 ) for myocardial infarction .
in the year after recruitment , the difference between participating and control practices was 0.8% for admissions with a primary diagnosis of copd . therefore , for an average practice with a primary diagnosis admission rate of 15% ( see table 2 ) , the effect of the healthy outlook service was a 5% drop in admissions with a primary diagnosis of copd ( i.e. , 0.8% is 5% of 15% ) .
although the primary goal of the healthy outlook service is not necessarily to reduce hospital admission rates , the hospital episodes statistics database has been used to assess the effect of the healthy outlook service on hospital admission rates of all general practitioners that have used the automated service ; this is the largest analysis of the effect of the healthy outlook service on hospital admissions and the results are presented here .
