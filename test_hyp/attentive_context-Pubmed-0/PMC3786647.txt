we conducted a case  crossover study in the canadian cities of vancouver and toronto10 to examine the influence of infrastructure on injury risk , while ensuring strict control for denominators ( ie , exposure to risk , cyclist traffic volume ) and for personal and trip characteristics ( eg , propensity for risk - taking , time of day ) .
it examines intersections and non - intersections separately to assess the distinct features of each , and to determine if the impact of infrastructure differed at these two location types.14 to do this , we used control sites matched to injury sites based on intersection status .
the presence of streetcar or train tracks within a 5  m diameter of the site was associated with increased injury risk ( adjusted or 4.15 , 95% ci 2.31 to 7.45 ) as was downhill grade ( adjusted or 2.05 , 95% ci 1.48 to 2.85 ) and the presence of construction at the site during the injury trip ( adjusted or 2.67 , 95% ci 1.70 to 4.19 ) .
cycling in the direction opposite to motor vehicle travel was associated with increased injury risk ( adjusted or 7.8 , 95% ci2.02 to 30.3 ) , as were downhill grade ( adjusted or 2.22 , 95% ci 1.21 to 4.08 ) and high cycling traffic ( more than 75 cyclists / h , adjusted or 3.04 , 95% ci 1.17 to 7.93 ) .
