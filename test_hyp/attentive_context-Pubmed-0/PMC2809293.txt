our findings suggest a unique role for fetuin - a deficiency as a biomarker of pad in the setting of type 2 diabetes .
a similar trend was noted among subjects with egfr > 80 ml  min  1.73 m ( 1.9   , p = 0.05 ) , suggesting that our findings were not confounded by the presence of moderate kidney disease .
finally , in a fully adjusted subgroup analysis , participants with hscrp levels <3 mg / dl ( n = 460 ) had higher odds of pad ( 2.6   , p = 0.002 ) , whereas subjects with high hscrp levels ( 3 mg / dl ; n = 234 ) did not ( 0.82   , p = 0.59 ) .
fetuin - a levels decreased consistently ( p for trend < 0.02 ) across abi clinically relevant cut points ( < 0.7 , 0.70.9 , 0.91.1 , and 1.11.4 ) ( 7 ) ( see supplemental fig . 1 in the online appendix [ available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-1541/dc1 ] ) . the odds of pad were significantly increased for each sd decrease in fetuin - a ( odds ratio 1.6 [ 95% ci 1.12.3 ] , p = 0.001 ) and the association persisted in incremental models that adjusted fully for age , sex , race , kidney function , cardiovascular risk factors , medication use , and hscrp ( 1.6   , p = 0.03 ) ( table 1 ) .
