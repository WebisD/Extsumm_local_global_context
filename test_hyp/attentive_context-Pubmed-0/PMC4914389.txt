nasal dermal sinus is a very rare congenital anomaly that is frequently associated with inclusion cysts ( dermoid or epidermoid).1

 3 at the end of the second month of gestation , the nasal and frontal bones are separated by the fonticulus frontalis . in this period ,
failure during ossification to obliterate this transcranial connection is the embryological pathway to nasal dermal sinus tract development.1

 4 in the present case , combined use of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography ( ct ) clearly demonstrated the detailed anatomical relationship of the dermal sinus associated with a dumbbell - shaped dermoid to the surrounding structures such as the fonticulus frontalis and foramen cecum.3

the dura projects into the nasal area through the anterior skull base opening ( foramen cecum ) , and lies in contact with the skin at the tip of the nose .
1j demonstrates the detailed anatomical relationship between the sinus tract with dumbbell - shaped dermoid and the surrounding structures .
the body of the dumbbell - shaped dermoid was located in the enlarged fonticulus frontalis and foramen cecum remnant ; the head of the dumbbell was the intracranial extension of the dermoid with bulging dura .
