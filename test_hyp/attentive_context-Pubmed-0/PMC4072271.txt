although there are data pointing to flaws in the training of prescribers , many teaching 
 professionals , particularly those involved in clinical courses , have alleged that 
 students do develop the ability to prescribe over the course of their education . 
 therefore , the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the pattern of 
 prescription over the dentistry course study in a brazilian 5-year program .
although dentistry students show a general improvement in their prescribing performance , 
 deficiencies remain even in advanced students , particularly in relation to uses of the 
 drug being prescribed .
partial score for patient and prescriber identification , obtained from the 
 paracetamol prescriptions produced by dentistry program students with respect to form of presentation , quantity , and dose / posology of the prescription , 
 we observed that students in their final two years had scores similar to each other 
 [ 4year 1.4 ( 1.2 - 1.5 ) ; 5year 1.4 ( 1.3 - 1.5 ) ] .
the data suggest that teaching of good prescription practices 
 should extend throughout the later phases of pre - professional dental education .
students in their fourth to tenth semester of studying dentistry at university 
 brasilia during the period from november 2010 to january 2011 who had completed their 
 basic pharmacology coursework were enrolled in this study .
