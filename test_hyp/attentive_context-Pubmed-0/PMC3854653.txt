sciatic hernias are one of the rarest types of hernia and often pose diagnostic difficulty to clinicians . imaging is often required to confirm the diagnosis and usually involves computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . to our knowledge , we report the 115th case of sciatic hernia in the literature who had a falsely negative ct but had the diagnosis confirmed using ultrasonography .
an 80-year - old lady was referred to the on - call surgical team by her gp with a 3-week history of a right - sided swelling of the buttock .
in which there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for a sciatic hernia and a negative ct , the use of ultrasonography for positional defects may be a useful aid to confirming the suspected diagnosis .
due to the positional nature of the swelling , a gluteal ultrasound was organized , which revealed a large colonic sciatic hernia ( fig .  2 ) .
she was reviewed by the on - call consultant who discharged her with a working diagnosis of possible obturator hernia , with a plan for an outpatient ct of her pelvis and follow - up in clinic .
