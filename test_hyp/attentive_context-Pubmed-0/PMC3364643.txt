we hereby report the four patients , three of whom were easily diagnosed gaucher 's disease with classical methods using bone marrow aspiration cytology , and one underwent teh splenectomy due to splenic mass and wasdiagnosed gaucher 's disease after pathological examination .
concept , the diagnosis of gaucher disease should be made with less invasive methods than surgery .
the differential diagnosis of the gaucher disease is considered in patients with unexplained organomegaly , easy bruise , bone pain , or a combination of these conditions .
many of the hemolytic anemias and platelet disorders respond to splenectomy after failure of medical therapy .
if the surgeon decided to perform splenectomy due to splenomegaly or splenic mass , the gaucher disease should be considered .
all suspected diagnoses are confirmed by the determination of the acid - glucosidase activity in isolated leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts .
a 39-year - old woman who intermittently suffered from nasal bleeding lasting 3 days was admitted to our hematology department .
pollock et al . , showed that even after a successful open splenectomy procedure , morbidity was about 21% and mortality was 2% . the morbidity and mortality increase especially in patients with the spleen of extremely great size .
