the lack of cre - mediated recombination in the brain of mip - cre / ert;r26r mice suggests that the newly developed mip - cre / ert line is currently the only available -cell  specific cre line . as with all newly developed cre transgenic lines , caution
10 ) raised the possibility that cre protein may be expressed in neurons involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis . to determine the extent of cre - mediated recombination within these specific neuronal populations , -gal positive cells in brain sections from leptin - treated pdx1-cre;r26r mice were co - localized with orexin and leptin - induced pstat3 , respectively . in the lateral hypothalamus ,
the studies examining the in vivo role of genes associated with biological processes in the pancreas and -cells have relied largely upon fragments of the rat ins2 gene promoter or the pdx1 gene promoter ( 3,813,16 ) .
furthermore , expression of the endogenous pdx1 gene was undetectable in the hypothalamus by real - time rt - pcr ( data not shown ) indicating that pdx1-cre , pdx1-cre , and pdx1-cre / ert transgenes are ectopically expressed in the brain .
the lack of -gal activity in the brains of pdx1 mice indicates that the cre expression in the brain of the pdx1-cre , pdx1-cre , and pdx1-cre / ert mice is not a reflection of endogenous pdx1 gene expression .
