the goal of the present study was to use conjoint analysis to capture patient preferences for attributes associated with chemotherapies for invasive breast cancer . specifically , the survey aimed to assess the trade - offs that breast cancer patients are willing to make among chemotherapies according to different toxicity , regimen , and efficacy profiles .
this was a cross - sectional , internet - based survey assessing the chemotherapy treatment preferences of women with breast cancer .
a better understanding of patients preferences may help to improve patient satisfaction and compliance with treatment regimens .
in summary , this survey evaluated a comprehensive set of severe toxicities and other features that are observed with chemotherapies for invasive breast cancer .
with respect to treatment experience , about 35% of patients were on chemotherapy at the time of their participation in the study , and the mean time since the sample s last chemotherapy administration was approximately 19 months .
our study showed that , despite the risk of serious toxicities , a small incremental survival advantage is highly influential in patient preferences for chemotherapy .
conjoint analysis , which is increasingly being used in evaluating medical interventions , involves respondents making trade - offs among product features ( attributes ) such as mode of administration and risk of adverse events.7,8 the resulting data , or utilities , enable the assessment of the relative importance of each treatment attribute ; specifically , they show the influence that each attribute has on overall treatment preferences .
