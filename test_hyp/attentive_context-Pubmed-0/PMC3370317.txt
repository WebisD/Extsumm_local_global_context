our results indicate that it is necessary to increase the level of awareness about the health consequences of policies that regulate transportation and fuel technology and that human health must play a role in the environmental agenda in urban areas .
the trade - offs associated with these regulatory differences are relevant to the situation in brazil because the implementation of a policy requiring cleaner diesel technologies ( cdt ; euro iv standards for vehicles produced in 2009 and low sulphur diesel ; diesel with 50 ppm of sulphur ) was postponed until 2012 without a comprehensive analysis of the health consequences ( 9 ) .
the projected morbidity effects of the delay in implementing the cdt policy were computed using the following equation ( 2 ) : hadm (  concyear )  =  hospital admissions due to the delay in reducing the ambient concentration of pm2.5 in a given year ;
to evaluate the health impact of the decision to delay implementation of the cdt policy , we estimated the monetary health costs of the non - abatement of ambient pm2.5 emissions due to this postponement in brazil .
increases in hospital admissions and medication use in areas with moderate or high levels of air pollution are commonly reported in different parts of the world ( 40 ) . the use of motorized transportation in brazil increases every year . according to denatran ( national traffic department ) ,
