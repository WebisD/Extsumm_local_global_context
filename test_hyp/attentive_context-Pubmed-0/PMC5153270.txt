we conducted a large population - based cohort study of copd patients in manitoba , canada , to characterize prescribing patterns and to evaluate the clinical appropriateness of the initiation and sequencing of copd medications .
most concerning , however , is a significant increase in the incidence of pneumonias in those using ics in general and compared to a labd alone.1416 based on data from the us from 2010 , inhaler prescriptions for copd patients increased up to three- to fourfold compared to the previous decade.17 a study of the veterans affairs health system from 1999 to 2003 found that of newly diagnosed copd patients , 29% were prescribed three to four medication classes over the 1-year follow - up.18 a canadian study of copd prescribing patterns found that 63% of patients in quebec and ontario with mild copd had received a prescription for ics.19 these findings lead us to hypothesize that copd medications of modest efficacy are being initiated and added earlier than may be indicated . to our knowledge , there are no recent large database studies on the first initiation and sequence of addition of copd medications in the literature .
while use of the most basic medications , the sabds , decreased over the study period , by far the most dramatic increase in use was the combination of laba and ics , which rose from 1.2% for those diagnosed in 1997 to over 27% for those diagnosed in 2012 ( figure 1 ) .
