recurrent shunt malfunction is a known complication after ventriculoperitoneal ( vp ) shunt surgeries . in chronic meningitis with hydrocephalus ,
we present an interesting case of chronic meningitis with shunt malfunction , presenting with expanding central canal syrinx and quadriparesis .
this case was investigated with a contrast ventriculogram to demonstrate a communicating central canal syrinx .
relevant english literature on shunt malfunction presenting with syringomyelia along with pathophysiology , its management and the role of contrast ventriculogram have been discussed .
the present case illustrates that a historical investigation like ventriculogram can still aid in diagnosis and management even in this modern era .
patients with vp shunt with late onset syringomyelia need to be evaluated for shunt malfunction .
there seems to be a 4 ventricular outlet obstruction and its communication with a central canal which can sometimes be demonstrated by a contrast ventriculogram . recognizing this condition is very important as a simple shunt revision benefits the patient .
a 2-year - old toddler presented to us with chronic fever and raised icp without any deficits in march 1998 .
ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction is a commonly faced problem , and a number of cases undergo shunt revision .
