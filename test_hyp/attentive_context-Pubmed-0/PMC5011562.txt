the aim of this study was to compare bmd , vitamin d levels , and osteopenia and osteoporosis 
 rates among male and female patients with pd and controls .
( 3 ) as weighty factors in the development of osteoporosis , lower vitamin d 
 levels and higher rates of vitamin d insufficiency were found for both male and female pd 
 patients in comparison with the controls .
the importance of osteoporosis and lower bone 
 mineral density ( bmd ) levels of pd patients are well understood . however , to our knowledge , 
 no studies to date have investigated the bmd , vitamin d levels , and osteoporosis frequency 
 of a pd population by comparing male and female patients with controls separately .
( 2 ) higher rates of osteoporosis and osteopenia of the lumbar spine , femoral neck , 
 and total hip were ascertained in female pd patients by comparison with the controls , 
 whereas a significant difference did not exist for these rates between male pd patients and 
 the controls .
* p<0.05 ; * * p<0.001 shows the mean bmd , t - scores , and vitamin d levels of the pd patients and 
 controls .
consequentially , screening for osteoporosis is needed as part of evaluations of patients 
 diagnosed with pd in order to establish preventive measures to limit the future risk due to 
 osteoporotic fractures , which may reduce qualify of life and even increase mortality .
