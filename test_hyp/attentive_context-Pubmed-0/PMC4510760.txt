identification and eligibility of studies : as the aim was to ascertain the prevalence of pulmonary tb among the tribal population in india , we selected and reviewed all tribal - focused , community studies , targeting a demographic population above or equal to 15 yr of age . only those studies in which individuals were examined for tb through initial screening for standard tb symptoms ( cough for > 2 wk , fever for > 2 wk , chest pain , and haemoptysis ) , and subsequently had their diagnosis confirmed by sputum smear and/or culture tests , were selected . though x - ray screening was also used when tb was suspected , this was not a required procedure given the potential inaccessibility of x - ray equipment in remote areas inhabited by tribal communities .
when both methods were used , there was a 25 per cent increase in detection of pulmonary tb .
eligibility of studies : the studies obtained through the search were included only if the following criteria were met : ( i ) should be community - based tb prevalence studies ; ( ii ) have targeted members of tribal communities aged 15 yr and above ; ( iii ) have done initial screening for standard tb symptoms ( cough for > 2 wk , fever for > 2 wk , chest pain , and haemoptysis ) ; ( iv ) have both smear ( for acid - fast bacilli , afb ) and culture tests done on the sputum samples collected . a positive case for tb
