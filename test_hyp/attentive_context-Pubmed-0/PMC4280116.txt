we have 
 studied the interplay between the critical adsorption of 
 a lattice hp protein with alternating h and p monomers and the coil  globule 
 transition with the dynamical monte carlo method .
second , the 
 sequence we have studied is the hp polymer with a fully alternating 
 sequence in which the surface interactions of h and p monomers are 
 treated as the same .
the conformational properties of the end - grafted 
 hp chain are strongly influenced by the pairwise h 
a further extension of our study is to treat the surface interactions 
 of h and p monomers differently .
we seek to increase understanding of the relationship 
 between protein adsorption and conformation change through a systematic 
 examination of the interplay between the collapse and critical adsorption 
 transitions .
studies of hp chains interacting with surfaces have also confirmed 
 the experimental observation that the presence of the surface can 
 significantly alter the lowest energy conformation of a folded protein and have been used to determine 
 conformational pseudophase diagrams of hp chains near a surface that 
 shows how temperature and the strength of attractive interactions 
 impact adsorption and folding . in this work ,
one route through which the hp model can be used to 
 understand protein adsorption and/or folding is the study of two transitions , 
 the coil
