, we investigated the different manifestations and treatment effects of syphilitic uveitis in chinese patients .
this is a retrospective case series of fifteen consecutive patients with syphilitic uveitis presenting at eye and ent hospital , fudan university , china , between may 2012 and april 2015 .
coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus was detected in two male patients ( 13.3% ) and one of them was homosexual .
both male and female were almost equally affected , and coinfection of syphilis with human immunodeficiency virus was uncommon .
nine of the fifteen patients were diagnosed previously as other types of uveitis that led to a delay in treatment , and long - standing cystoid macular edema and optic neuropathy resulted in poor visual acuity ( p < 0.05 ) .
. timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for visual prognosis and any delay in treatment of syphilitic uveitis was associated with poor visual prognosis .
all patients in this study had posterior involvement and the most common manifestations were retinal vasculitis and papillitis , while isolated anterior uveitis was rare .
our data showed both male and female were almost equally affected and coinfection of syphilis with human immunodeficiency virus was uncommon .
