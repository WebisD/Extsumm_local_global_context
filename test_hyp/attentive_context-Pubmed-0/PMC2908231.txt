when cortical blindness is suspected , the ophthalmologist and neurologist should perform a combined examination , being cautious of permanent sequelae . in conclusion , with the reported visual loss in our pediatric patient , surgeons should consider the possibility of visual loss and cerebrovascular injury after a cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass .
a 21-month - old male patient , 75 cm in height and 10 kg in weight , experienced tricuspid valve regurgitation ( tvr ) and was scheduled to undergo tricuspid valve plasty . the tvr was discovered in a follow - up test 1 year after he had undergone ventricular septal defect repair surgery . before tricuspid valve plasty
there were also cases of temporary cortical blindness reported after post - cardiac surgery angiography . in the case of children ,
the early indicators of brain damage after surgery are age , the complexity of surgery , metabolic acidosis , increase in lactate , and artery acidosis . diagnosing cortical blindness is simple when the patient makes a complaint but as in our case , a pediatric patient has limited ability to communicate . therefore , conducting an eeg , fvep , angiography , and funduscopy can assist in making a diagnosis . in this case , the eeg did not show the abnormal finding of a loss in alpha rhythm . however , computed laminography revealed an infarction in the occipital cortex
