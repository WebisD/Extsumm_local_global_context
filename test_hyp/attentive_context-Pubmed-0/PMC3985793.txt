herein , we describe a case of metachronous multiple primary malignancies consisting of hcc and gastric cancer with intracranial metastasis .
hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide , and it is the third most common cause of death from cancer .
a 76-year - old man visited our hospital because of visual disturbance , weakness of the left upper and lower limbs , and gait disturbance .
pathological examination revealed that the tumor was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastric cancer origin ( fig .
it is of importance to determine whether or not aggressive treatment , including surgical resection , improves both the performance status and the prognosis of the patients .
together , these findings indicate the possibility that sufficiently aggressive treatment for intracranial metastasis of gastric cancer enables further anti - cancer treatment and improves the prognosis , even of patients with multiple primary malignancies . when original tumors are radically treated in patients with multiple primary malignancies , further treatment including craniotomy and gamma - knife for the metastatic intracranial tumors might contribute to prolonged survival . considering that intracranial metastasis of gastric cancers is frequently accompanied by bone , liver , and lung metastases   ,
