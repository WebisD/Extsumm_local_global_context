it was found to be increased with the increment in the roughage for liquid fraction ( m1dl  =  8.11% , m2dl  =  8.59% , m3dl  =  8.74% ) whereas , for solid fraction it was found to be in similar abundance for m2ds and m3ds ( 7.92% ) as compared to m1ds group ( 7.65% ) . the category that belonged to enzymes for di and oligo saccharide utilization was found which is composed by the genes related to maltose / maltodextrin utilization , xylose utilization , l - rhamnose utilization , l - arabinose utilization , lactose utilization , mannose utilization etc .
the assignment of the sequences to seed database revealed that at subsystem level , out of the 24 subsystems identified , the genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism were found to be most abundant in each metagenome groups ( fig .
so , that particular category of subsystem was sub - classified at further level . by sub - classifying , we found that the genes associated with sugar utilization in thermogales were more abundant for both liquid and solid fractions ( table 1 , table 2 ) .
the genes linked to maltose utilization decreased in both the fractions with the increment in the roughage . whereas , the genes associated with the mannose and xylose utilization increased with the increment in the roughage in both the fractions . the genes predicted for carbohydrate hydrolases decreased with the increment in the roughage for liquid fraction and increased in case of the solid fraction . moreover , the genes related to dehydrogenase complexes increased with the increment in the roughage for both the fractions . as observed by brulc et al . , the bovine rumen harboured the functional genes associated with carbohydrate utilization . a study by wang et al
