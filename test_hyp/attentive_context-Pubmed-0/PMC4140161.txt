relative to women with normal birth weight , neither women with very low birth weight , irr 1.01 ( 95% ci 0.811.26 ) , nor women with low birth weight , 0.91 ( 0.840.99 ) , had an increased risk of incident obesity ; women with high birth weight had a borderline higher risk of incident obesity , 1.12 ( 1.001.26 ) ( data not shown ) .
recent results provide support to the fetal insulin hypothesis , as three genetic loci associated with type 2 diabetes ( adcy5 , cdkal1 , and hhex - ide ) were also associated with low birth weight ( 1517 ) , and at least two of the shared loci ( cdkal1 and hhex - ide ) are involved in -cell dysfunction ( 18,19 ) . because the underlying defect would be a deficiency in pancreas development , we would not expect , based on the fetal insulin hypothesis , that increased adiposity is a mediator between low birth weight and type 2 diabetes later in life . in the current study , we assessed the relation of self - reported birth weight to adult risk of type 2 diabetes in the black women s health study ( bwhs ) , a prospective cohort study .
