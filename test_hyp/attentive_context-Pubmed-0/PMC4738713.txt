emerging evidence suggests that anxa1 also induces macrophage reprogramming toward a resolving phenotype , another key event to restore tissue homeostasis . in this review , we summarize several physiological and potential therapeutic actions of anxa1 on inflammation resolution .
in particular , this review highlights recent advances on the actions of this endogenous mediator and its potential clinical utility .
anxa1 is a gc - regulated protein that modulates a wide range of cellular and molecular steps of the inflammatory response and is deeply involved in the endogenous mechanisms that are activated to bring about proper resolution .
inflammation is a crucial physiological response for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis , protecting the host against invading microorganisms , foreign substances , or host self - disturbers , such as the molecules derived from damaged cells .
indeed , anxa1 contributes to tissue homeostasis by inducing macrophage reprogramming toward a resolving phenotype . the combination of these mechanisms results in an effective resolution of inflammation , pointing to anxa1 and its mimetic peptides as promising therapeutic agents for treating inflammatory diseases .
the promising findings on the potential therapeutic use of anxa1 in inflammatory diseases have stimulated the development of pharmaceutical formulations containing anxa1 mimetic peptides , such as the controlled - release hydrogels for dermal wound repair application   and targeted polymeric nanoparticles .
