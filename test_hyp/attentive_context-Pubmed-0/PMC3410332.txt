the current in vitro study evaluated vickers hardness ( vk ) and depth of cure ( hardness ratio ) of three microhybrid , two nanohybrid and one nanofilled resin composites , polymerized with a led curing unit by three different polymerization modes .
the effectiveness of cure at the top and bottom surface was not affected by soft - start polymerization mode .
six resin composites were selected for the present study and were chosen in accordance with their type of filler particles : three microhybrid ( esthet.x hd , amaris , filtek silorane ) , two nanohybrid ( grandio , ceram.x mono ) and one nanofilled ( filtek supreme xt ) .
the influence of three curing modes ( standard 20 s and 40 s and soft - start 40 s ) on hardness ratio of six composite resins was compared . according to statistical analysis ( t student test ) , it was observed that for all the materials there was no statistical difference ( p > 0.5 ) in hardness values recorded on top surfaces .
curing time did not affect hardness ratio values for filtek silorane , grandio and filtek supreme xt .
a statistical significant difference ( p < 0.01 ) was recorded on the bottom surfaces for all the materials tested ; and this is due to the reduced energy reaching the lower layers , thus affecting the final hardness .
