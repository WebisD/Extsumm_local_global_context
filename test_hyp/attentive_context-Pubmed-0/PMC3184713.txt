we hereby report a clinical experience describing a significant complication occurring after safeguard use for femoral hemostasis . in this case ,
an extensive pressure ulcer developed in the groin of a very elderly patient in whom a safeguard had been applied overnight because of persistent oozing after diagnostic coronary angiography .
information on vascular complications from access of the femoral artery , the methods of arterial closure , and post - procedural care instructions ( including avoidance of lenghty mechanical pressure with pneumatic devices ) can help physicians and nurses to provide safe and effective care to patients after cardiac catheterization .
a 95-year old diabetic female was referred to our catheterization laboratory for workup of percutaneous aortic valve replacement because of a severe calcified aortic stenosis and pronounced dyspnea on effort .
a number of devices are available to aid in 
 achieving post - procedure homeostasis .
vascular access complications are amongst the most common adverse events associated with coronary angiography and intervention .
the femoral approach is still the most commonly used route for diagnostic cardiac catheterizations and percutaneous coronary interventions . at the end of the procedure the femoral artery is usually compressed manually to control bleeding until hemostasis is achieved .
