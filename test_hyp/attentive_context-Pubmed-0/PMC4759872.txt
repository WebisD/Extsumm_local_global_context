comparative results of mpfl reconstructions in literature we conclude that an implantless , tunnel - free mpfl reconstruction using this technique could reduce complications , simplify the procedure and give optimal outcomes .
a majority of the procedures described for mpfl reconstruction have shown good results with kujala scores ranging from 83 to 96 .
the study was conducted to confirm if comparable or even better results than those documented in literature could be achieved implementing this implantless and bone tunnel - free technique with a low complication rate .
however , the aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of this technique of mpfl reconstruction for its rate of complications and compare the results to other series currently reported in literature .
fifty - six knees ( 50 patients ) were treated with mpfl reconstruction using  basket weave  technique in the past 49 months .
the postoperative examination therefore demonstrates a normal mediolateral mobility with a normal soft endpoint with a high patient satisfaction scores in their followup .
( f ) the procedure can be utilized for the skeletally immature cases , those with hypoplastic patellae or even for cases with patellar arthroplasty .
a radiological landmark for insertion point of mpfl on femur has been described by schttle et al.45 however , it is important to go into the details of this article and to note that one of the eight mpfl insertions studied was in fact found to be posterior to the posterior line of schottles  area .
