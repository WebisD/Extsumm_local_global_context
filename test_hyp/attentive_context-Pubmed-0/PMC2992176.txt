this was seen in men but not in women , and the more components of metabolic syndrome were present , the more impaired was cognitive functioning .
the interaction between hs - crp and metabolic syndrome was significant for executive functions (  = 2.79 ; 95% ci [ 4.67 to 0.92 ] ; p = 0.004 ) and showed a nonsignificant trend for memory (  = 0.56 ; 95% ci [ 1.17 to 0.04 ] ; p = 0.068 ) .
2 covariates showed that men , but not women , with metabolic syndrome who had high hs - crp levels ( i.e. , >
sex - specific effects associated with proinflammatory markers and the lack of significant associations with mri abnormalities ought to be considered in future studies on mechanisms of cognitive impairment in metabolic syndrome .
middle - aged and elderly community - dwelling subjects with metabolic syndrome performed worse on tasks assessing memory and executive functions than their counterparts without metabolic syndrome .
the austrian stroke prevention study ( asps ) is a prospective study on the effects of vascular risk factors on brain structure and function in cognitively normal middle - aged and elderly inhabitants of graz , austria ; details have been previously described ( 13,14 ) .
