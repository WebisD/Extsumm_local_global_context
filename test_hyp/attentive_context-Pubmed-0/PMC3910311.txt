the study aims to identify the differences in s1p levels by collecting bone marrow in patients who underwent surgeries due to osteoporotic fractures and causes with other than osteoporotic fractures .
this study verified that bone marrow s1p level was lower in patient group with osteoporotic hip fractures compared with control group .
bone marrow s1p levels were 2.311.94 mol / l in patient group with osteoporotic hip fracture and 3.761.10 mol / l in control group , showing significance ( p=0.025 ) ( fig .
bone marrow s1p levels were 2.480.38 mol / l in patient group with osteoporotic hip fracture , and 3.701.09 mol / l in control group .
these suggest that the difference of s1p levels between peripheral blood and bone marrow is critical on bone metabolism .
when we analyzed the correlation between bone marrow s1p level and bmd , statistically significant correlation was not observed after the adjustment of several confounding factors ( =0.026 - 0.482 , p=0.171 - 0.944 ) ( table 2 ) .
we compared bone marrow s1p levels of two groups according to the presence of osteoporotic hip fractures ( fig .
three patients ( 75% ) were females among 4 patients with osteoporotic hip fracture ( table 1 ) . among 12 patients who underwent operation due to causes other than osteoporotic hip fracture , 7 patients were osteoarthritis , 4 patients were avascular necrosis ( avn ) of the femoral head , and a patient was hip dislocation .
