d bird s eye view of how the child can obstruct the caretaker s view on the stairway
emergency department and orthopedic clinic records were reviewed between 2004 and 2012 to identify patients with an orthopedic injury after a fall from stairs .
the following demographic and epidemiologic data were recorded for each patient : age , gender , location of injury , and mechanism of fall .
sixteen children were retrospectively found to have a fracture from a  fall - in - arms  injury sustained while a caregiver was going down stairs , and were included in this study .
three children ( 19  % ) required a closed reduction of their femur fractures in the operating room ; their total care charges averaged $ 23,568 . for the children
stairway falls are a leading cause of injury in patients less than 5  years of age   .
this can lead to a fall by the caretaker and an injury to the child and/or caretaker . to date , several previous studies have been conducted evaluating stairway injuries in children , but none have focused on this specific mechanism ( fall from caregiver s arms ) or the injuries associated with these falls . the goal of this study was to identify injuries that may occur when a caretaker falls while carrying a child on a stairway , to understand the pathomechanics of this injury , and to perform a cost analysis of the injury.fig .
