we performed this meta analysis to study the clinical efficacy of b1 adrenergic blockade in preventing clinical recurrence of syncope and to determine the rate of adverse events compared to placebo .
our results indicate a lack of clinical efficacy of these drugs and in fact a statistically non significant increase in adverse events .
the largest trial and the only multicenter study to date was performed by sheldon et al who randomized patients with a history of syncope and a positive tilt table test to metoprolol versus placebo.7 metoprolol was no more efficacious than placebo in preventing recurrent syncope both in the intention to treat and on - treatment analysis
more randomized controlled studies are required to identify other effective therapies for this poorly understood disorder and a placebo arm should be a part of all such studies .
we searched the pubmed , cinahl , web of science , and cochrane databases from inception to 2009 using mesh terms  vasovagal syncope   drug therapy   adrenergic beta antagonists  and individually using the key words 
however , in the study by madrid and colleagues , atenolol failed to decrease the recurrence of syncope compared to placebo.6 the median number of syncopal episodes during follow up was 2 in atenolol group and 0 in placebo group ( p = 0.215 ) .
