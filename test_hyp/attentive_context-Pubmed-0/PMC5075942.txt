for extremely low pumping thresholds , the solutions containing gain 
 material and silver - enhanced and silica - coated nanostars exhibit spectrally 
 narrow lasing modes , typical for coherent random lasing .
additionally , 
 we reveal that the silica coating nearly does not influence the operation 
 of the silver - enhanced gold nanostar - based random lasers in terms 
 of lasing intensity and pumping threshold , in contrast to gold nanostar - based 
 random lasers , where only ase and no coherent random lasing was observed 
 for the silica - coated gold nanostars .
further , 
 we show that silver - enhancement of the gold nanostars reduces the 
 pumping threshold for nanostar - based random lasing .
we attribute this to the plasmon resonances of auagnsts 
 and auagnsts@sio2 , which spectrally overlap perfectly with 
 both the absorption and pl emission of the gain materials as well 
 as the excitation wavelength .
first , hot - spots 
 at the tips of the auagnsts and of auagnsts@sio2 can be 
 resonantly excited by the pumping laser , and hence the gain material 
 in the vicinity of the tips can be excited with a higher effective 
 intensity .
the large scattering cross 
 sections and easily accessible hot - spots 
 provided by auagnsts and the simultaneous compatibility of the auagnsts@sio2 with polar and nonpolar solvents render hybrid multilayered 
 plasmonic nanostars one of the most promising candidates for an effective 
 photon - management in organic and inorganic optoelectronic devices 
 as well as for biosensing and analytical applications .
