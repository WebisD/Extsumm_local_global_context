using detailed nmr 
 and computational approaches with the natural product and three diastereomeric 
 analogues , it was found that the c-5c-7 anti / c-7c14 syn arrangement of stereocenters 
 produces a unique combination of three - dimensional shape and electrostatic 
 potential that is responsible for the potent biological activity of 
 the natural product . in an effort to understand
these 
 findings suggest that both synthetic ( )-palmyrolide 
 a and its enantiomer function with equal potency as vgsc antagonists 
 to block veratridine - induced sodium influx . with regard to identification 
 of the pharmacophore of this natural product
the similar biological 
 activity found for the natural stereoisomer and its enantiomer , continued 
 investigations in this area will focus on uncovering the specific 
 molecular target and associated binding site , which may also assist 
 in future analogue development of novel sodium channel blocking analgesics 
 derived from palmyrolide a.
moreover , analogues lacking the enamide double 
 bond were of high potency in this assay , and thus this functionality 
 appears unnecessary for blocking vgscs . finally ,
, it appears that the 
 intact macrolide is required since acyclic versions were inactive 
 as inhibitors of vgscs .
nonlinear regression analysis of concentration  response 
 data for active analogues of ( )-palmyrolide a. a three - parameter 
 logistic fit of the palmyrolide a analogue inhibition of the response 
 to veratridine is shown for each active compound .
