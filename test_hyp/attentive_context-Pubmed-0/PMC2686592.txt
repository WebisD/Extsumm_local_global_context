this molecular information is placed in the proper metabolic context and thus enables the exploration of particular features that have traditionally been difficult and tedious to address . in summary
, bionemo complements the currently available information on biodegradation that focus in the biochemical aspects by adding additional layers of molecular information at the level of proteins and gene control .
decades of biochemical studies have produced a considerable wealth of knowledge about this unique metabolism , and this has recently started to be categorized and stored in structured databases .
questions such as the molecular basis of enzyme specificity , their catalytic mechanism , the evolutionary origin of this novel metabolism , or the spreading of such activities in the environment , are extremely difficult to address in the absence of accurate sequence and genetic information .
the databases provide links to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) , but unfortunately kegg associations between proteins and reactions , are often inaccurate , and direct to proteins electronically annotated in the course of complete genome sequencing projects . as an alternative method , um - bbd allows searches with the enzymatic activity name as query directly in genbank , but usually it is difficult to identify if the association between the protein and the biochemical activity is based on a published experimental characterization or whether it was inferred by computational methods . as an alternative to these approximations , bionemo provides accurate associations between proteins and reactions based on customized database searches , extensive literature mining and manual curation .
