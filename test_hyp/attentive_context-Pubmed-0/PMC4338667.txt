we report a female with follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in struma ovarii . after pelvic surgery , thyroid morphofunctional examinations were performed and a single nodular lesion in the left lobe was discovered .
a more aggressive treatment should not be denied for malignant struma ovarii without any evidence , even when apparently confined into the ovary .
usually , total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine treatment is the choice treatment in metastatic malignant struma ovarii , while these procedures are still controversial in non - metastatic thyroid cancer arising in struma ovarii .
however , in selected cases , aggressive treatment may be advisable to decrease the risk of recurrence and to allow an accurate follow - up .
radioiodine - ablation of residual thyroid tissue was performed and levothyroxine mildly - suppressive treatment was started .
five percent of struma ovarii cases have been proven to be malignant and , as in the thyroid gland , papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common histotype arising in struma ovarii . because of the unusual occurrence of this tumor , its management and follow - up after pelvic surgery is still controversial .
struma ovarii is an ovarian teratoma , represented in more than 50% by thyroid tissue .
