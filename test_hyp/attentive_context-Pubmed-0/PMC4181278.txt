patients with poaf were followed for an average period of 2 years to assess the recurrence rate of the arrhythmia and its prognostic role on early and late risk of stroke and mortality . finally , the role of cardiopulmonary by - pass ( cpb ) surgical revascularization ( cpb - cabg ) and op - cabg on poaf was evaluated .
aim of present prospective investigation was to evaluate the incidence of poaf in patients undergoing isolated surgical revascularization in a tertiary heart surgery centre .
restoration of sinus rhythm before hospital discharge may have significantly limited the negative prognostic effects of post operative atrial fibrillation . at present , the guidelines of the american college of chest physician state that op - cabg can not be recommended to decrease post operative af because of conflicting results resulted from randomized controlled trials or large - scale concurrent cohort studies .
despite the reported limitations , our study does not support the hypothesis that postoperative af is associated with an increased late mortality , rate of stroke or rehospitalization .
multivariate analysis revealed that only antero - posterior left atrium diameter was associated with an increased risk of poaf ( odds ratio = 1.15 ; 95% confidence interval ( ci )   , p<0.001 ) ( table 4 ) .
