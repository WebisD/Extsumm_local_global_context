the authors report the successful laparoscopic management of an acute presentation of an obstructed obturator hernia .
this case illustrates the usefulness of ct in diagnosing obturator hernia and it also confirms that laparoscopic mesh repair of an incarcerated obturator hernia is safe and technically feasible .
an 85-year - old female with a background of trans - abdominal hysterectomy , hypertension and a previous thyroid lobectomy , presented acutely with a 1-day history of upper abdominal pain radiating down her left leg associated with numerous episodes of emesis .
it accounts for < 1% of all hernias . typically , they manifest in multiparous , thin females within their seventh to ninth decades of life . patients frequently present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction and , occasionally , pain along the distribution of the obturator nerve on the ipsilateral side ( howship  romberg sign )
, we present this rare case to raise awareness of a rare presentation but with significant morbidity and mortality if a high index of suspicion is not maintained .
she was treated presumptively as a small bowel obstruction and non - operative measures were employed and the patient proceeded to have a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the abdomen and pelvis , which indicated proximal small bowel obstruction secondary to a left obturator hernia ( fig .  1 ) .
