in addition , we investigated the antifungal susceptibility profiles of these isolates to 10 antifungal drugs to determine the most appropriate therapeutic choice(s ) in women with c. krusei vaginitis .
high mic rates were observed for fluconazole , of which 42.9% of the isolates were s - dd and 57.1% were r. remarkably , only 42.9% and 67.9% of the isolates were susceptible to itraconazole ( six s - dd and 10 r ) and voriconazole ( four s - dd and five r ) , respectively .
thus , the identification of c. krusei in vaginal samples and in vitro antifungal testing will assist in the selection of appropriate antifungal agents and therapy duration .
perineal laceration is significantly higher ( p = 0.006 ) in the c. krusei group compared with the non - c .
all the c. krusei isolates were susceptible to amphotericin b , caspofungin , ketoconazole , and miconazole , and 10 of the 28 isolates ( 35.7% ) were defined as s - dd for 5-flucytosine .
the antifungal susceptibilities of c. krusei isolated from patients with avvc and rvvc did not differ significantly from those isolated from the group of women without symptoms of vaginitis ( p > 0.05 ; table 4 ) .
