the programme 's prespecified theory of change indicated that , if successful , there would be increased prescribing of preventive therapies for cvd risk factors in the short - to - medium term , and greater reductions in cvd hospitalisations and mortality in the medium - to - long term in the kw intervention practices compared with non - kw practices.11
cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is a major cause of death and an important contributor to the wide and growing inequalities in mortality in high - income countries.1 as a result , the reduction of cvd has long been an objective of health policy in the uk and elsewhere , with a series of initiatives introduced with this as either a primary or secondary focus.2 recently , there has been interest in the potential of  health checks ( a non - programmatic form of screening for cvd risk factors ) to contribute to reductions in overall cvd mortality and inequalities.3 
 4 the core theory for this approach is that it is possible to influence several of the factors ( such as smoking , high blood pressure and obesity ) that increase the risk of cvd , using primary prevention therapies such as statin and antihypertensive drugs and behavioural interventions to reduce cvd risk for those without cvd but currently at high risk . by systematically identifying and offering treatment to those at high risk ,
