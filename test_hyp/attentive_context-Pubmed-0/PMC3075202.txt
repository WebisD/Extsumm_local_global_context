this may be one of the few reported cases of primary hepatic fibrosarcoma confirmed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy .
the purpose of this case report is to share information on a rare tumor of the liver , a primary fibrosarcoma , as up to the late seventies the literature about this entity was restricted to autopsy diagnosis . to our knowledge
is surgery with curative intent . in a recent article from sloan - kettering cancer center , between 1981 and 2004 they identified only 30 cases of primary liver sarcomas of which
described a series of 20 cases of sarcomatous tumors of the liver , of which angiosarcoma was the commonest , and concluded that primary treatment is surgery with survival depending on the degree of differentiation . from the available literature , primary treatment to be considered for fibrosarcoma of the liver
we conclude by passing on the message that this rare entity does exist and is an area for workup to make guidelines for management of such tumors .
