similar 
 correlation of egfr with ccr was reported by khosla , et al . , although the analyzed patients were 
 restricted to the population with a difference between two measurements of ccr of less than 
 25% . to clarify the actual utility of egfr in peritoneal dialysis practice
this study revealed the practical profile of egfr , distinct from tccr , as a more stable 
 marker for small solutes clearance by dialysis and the kidney .
, we retrospectively 
 collected the data from 21 pd patients at ja toride medical center for the period of one 
 year .
- egfr difference and npcr ( a ) and total cr excretion and npcr ( b ) in one 
 patient who showed fluctuating diet intake .
weekly creatinine clearance ( wccr ) and kt / v are well - known parameters reflecting dialysis 
 dose and adequacy , and are applied to adjustment of the dialysis menu in each patient who 
 undergoes peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) . however , the limitations of these parameters in 
 predicting survival and morbidity have been reported .
variations in the difference between egfr and tccr were correlated with both 
 total cr excretion and npcr .
a more extended and 
 longitudinal study will be needed to verify the actual value of egfr in pd practice .
