we found that conducting formative assessment using an adaptive cbpr process with a range of school - based stakeholders was an effective way to develop culturally appropriate and tailored intervention materials and approaches in these multiethnic school settings .
cbpr partnerships with school - based communities represent an important opportunity for researchers seeking to address a broad spectrum of adolescent health problems .
this paper describes the use of an adaptive community based participatory research ( cbpr ) process through which formative research data were collected for development of an sbhc intervention for prevention of metabolic syndrome in multiethnic high school students .
this approach enabled us to accomplish the following goals in the first year of this study : ( 1 ) gain a better understanding of the school setting with regard to barriers to physical activity and healthful food choices , ( 2 ) create strategies / materials to address these barriers , and ( 3 ) develop culturally appropriate intervention materials and approaches based on input from study participants .
the student and parent interviews generated initial thematic findings that were used to guide discussions in the subsequent cac sessions toward the development of the intervention dvd and clinician toolkit .
