our data suggest that focal fdg uptake representing incidentalomas should be followed by pathologic diagnosis , especially in those with chronic conditions or known diagnosis of a solid tumor .
thyroid incidentalomas are quite common , and their prevalence depends on the population studied , region or country where the study was conducted , and the diagnostic methods used .
a total of 156 patients who had abnormal fdg uptake were further selected for secondary analysis . from this group ,
in this study , only 40 out of 156 incidentalomas ( 25.6% ) had biopsies .
the highest suv value is 9.9 and the lowest is 2.5 ( figure 2 ) , and for the benign lesions , the highest is 46 and the lowest is 0.8 . from the 40 biopsy reports , there are 15 cancerous nodules , corresponding to about 38% .
there are papers that show the correlation between size and suv value while some show no correlation . in the group of cancerous incidentalomas , there are 6 males ( mean age 53.3 , age range 3378 ) and 9 females ( mean age 56.2 , age range 3873 ) . for the group with benign incidentalomas , there are 4 males ( mean age 76.5 , age range 6983 ) and 21 females ( mean age 59.1 , age range 3986 ) .
