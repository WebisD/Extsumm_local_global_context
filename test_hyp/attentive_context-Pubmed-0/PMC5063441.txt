the specific objectives of the study were to evaluate growth , lung function , and the level of physical activity in schoolchildren who were in the 8- to 11-year age bracket and who had been vlbw preterm infants and to compare their growth , lung function , and level of physical activity with those of schoolchildren who were in the same age bracket and who had been normal - birth - weight ( nbw ) full - term infants .
in the present study , the schoolchildren who had been vlbw preterm infants and those who had been nbw full - term infants were found to be similar in terms of growth ( weight and height ) and lung function .
furthermore , perinatal and neonatal variables were not associated with lung function in the schoolchildren studied .
the present study was motivated by the contradictory findings regarding lung function in school - age children who were low - birth - weight preterm infants , the possibility of retardation of growth ( weight and height ) in such children , and the significant changes in the types of activities in which they engage .
mean gestational age ( 28.1  0.9 weeks ; p = 0.006 ) and mean birth weight ( 1,015.0  122.7 g ; p = 0.008 ) were significantly lower in those 6 than in the remaining 42 participants in the vlbwpi group .
