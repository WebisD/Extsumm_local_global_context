in the present study , we set out to test whether a 4-week , adult - onset fluoxetine treatment is effective against behavioral alterations in the ts65dn mouse model of down syndrome .
here , we determined the impact of an adult - onset , chronic treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine on behavioral alterations in the ts65dn mouse model of down syndrome .
we tested if an oral fluoxetine treatment regime has therapeutic effects on cognitive impairments ( spatial learning in the morris water maze ) in the ts65dn mouse model of down syndrome .
we did not find a beneficial effect of fluoxetine treatment on ts65dn behavioral phenotypes , but instead our findings suggest the presence of genotype - dependent fluoxetine side effects ; we observed seizures and mortality in treated ts65dn mice , but not wild - type controls .
future studies should reevaluate these findings in larger animal cohorts , determine what the nature of the possible drug  genotype interaction is ( e.g. , genotype - dependent differences in drug metabolism , tissue distribution , or truly differential effects of equivalent drug tissue concentrations on cellular / tissue functions ) , and establish dose - response relationships for these possible side effects .
