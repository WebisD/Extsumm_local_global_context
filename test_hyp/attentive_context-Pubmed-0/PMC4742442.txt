, we investigated the histopathologic evaluation outcomes of anterior periprostatic fat ( appf ) tissues that were separately sent for pathologic evaluation in order to examine presence of lns and metastasis .
overall , 129 patients who underwent rarp between january 2012 and october 2014 were included in our study .
of the patients with pt3 disease ( n = 29 ) , psm rate was 65.5% ( n = 19 ) .
radical prostatectomy ( rp ) is a common curative surgical treatment option in localized prostate cancer ( pca ) .
mean patient age , serum psa , prostate weight and bmi were 62.2 5.5 ( range 4574 ) , 9.3 6.3ng / dl ( range 0.330.3 ) , 60.3 27.2 grams ( range 11.0180 ) and 26.6 1.9 kg / m ( range 20.0 - 30.3 ) , respectively .
identification of metastatic lns in the appf might have an impact on postoperative staging and management of the patients .
in addition , removal of appf leads to a better exposure of the surgical field .
in addition , studies that identified ln metastasis in anterior periprostatic lymphoid tissue had a higher volume of patients with high and intermediate risk patients , as compared to our study . in a multi - center study , kim et al
