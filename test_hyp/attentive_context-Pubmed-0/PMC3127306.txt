we present a case of concomitant infection with dengue and h1n1 virus with an unexpected rapid recovery and milder symptoms of influenza .
management can be challenging , in an intensive care setting , in case a patient is afflicted with more than one microbiological infection .
severity of h1n1 in a patient with dengue should not only be clinically evaluated but also by laboratory tests for viral load .
clinical status in case of concomitant infection with h1n1 and dengue should be cautiously interpreted .
a 23-year - old man was referred to our institute from a peripheral hospital . the patient had a history of fever , malaise , cough , sore throat , and breathlessness since last 7 days .
infection of a single host by multiple pathogens may result in competition for host resources .
the chest skiagram ( ap view ) showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates and ultrasonography revealed ascites with bilateral moderate pleural effusion .
it may be possible for two viruses to infect the same cell and as such , there may be interaction of the pathologic pathways of the two viruses , leading to change of virulence or altered host response .
as both the infections are known etiologic factors of ards , concomitant infection with both was expected to cause severe ards in this patient . however ,
