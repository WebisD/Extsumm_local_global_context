, we report a case of a japanese woman who developed multiple abscesses , which were , surprisingly , disseminated over 30 parts throughout the body , under poorly controlled diabetic conditions accompanied by ketoacidosis , but was successfully treated with prompt and appropriate therapy .
in addition , the present case strongly suggests that we should continue appropriate therapies until the complete disappearance of abscesses .
pyomyositis is a primary pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle , an uncommon cause of musculoskeletal infection . although relatively common in tropical areas , it is very rare in temperate areas1 .
a 26yearold woman was referred to kawasaki medical school hospital , kurashiki , japan , because of a high fever and right thigh pain .
therefore , prompt imaging procedures , aggressive surgical interventions and appropriate antibiotic therapy are very important to cure this disease without any complications . here
pyomyositis is a rare infectious disease , but physicians should be aware of its possibility in poorly controlled diabetic patients .
in contrast , pyomyositis is observed in immunodeficient hosts , particularly in the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infected condition2 . in nonhiv infected cases ,
severe hyperglycemic state with diabetic ketoacidosis and severe infectious signs led to the diagnosis of pyomyositis . furthermore , typical ct imaging of the bulky abscess in the right adductor muscle was helpful for the diagnosis .
