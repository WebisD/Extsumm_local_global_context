a 57-year - old caucasian female presented with a chief complaint of more than one year of dyspareunia .
pelvic digits are rare congenital anomalies that develop in soft tissue.(1 - 4 ) there are less than twenty reported cases in the literature .
however , in order to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic conditions , physicians should be aware that this anomaly can be a source of pain and disability .
literature reports have suggested various origins of the pelvic digit , including congenital formation , myositis ossificans , or traumatic avulsion.(1 - 3,5,6 ) in this case , the defining features were that it was well corticated with a pseudoarticulation between bony segments , resembling a digit .
