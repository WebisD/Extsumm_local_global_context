fortunately , she achieved mucosal healing ( mh ) at a low dose of thalidomide for 15 months .
crohn disease ( cd ) is a progressive and destructive disease , over 70% cd patients require intestinal resection at some time during their life time .
the rate of endoscopic recurrence in cd patients 1 year after operation ranges from 30% to 70% , increasing to 50% to 100% after 3 years . despite evolving prophylactic treatment algorithms , treatment of postsurgical recurrence is still required for a proportion of patients . here presents a case of postoperative endoscopic cd recurrence that achieves mucosal healing ( mh ) on thalidomide .
