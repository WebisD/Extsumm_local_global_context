tamv 
 showed no significant difference between the supine position and leg- up position ( table 1table 1.time-averaged maximum flow velocity in the common femoral vein in three different 
 positions with and without stockings ) . under the with stockings condition , the tamv in the head - up position ( 13.6  
 4.4  cm / sec ) was also significantly lower than those in the supine ( 33.1  15.5  cm / sec ) and 
 leg - up positions ( 27.7  9.4  cm / sec ) ( supine vs. head up , p<0.01 , leg up vs. head up , 
 p<0.01 ) .
under the without stockings condition , the tamv in the head - up position ( 16.6  6.1  cm / sec ) 
 was significantly lower than those in the supine ( 30.1  17.8  cm / sec ) and leg - up positions 
 ( 28.9  17.5  cm / sec ) ( supine vs. head up , p<0.05 , leg up vs. head up , p<0.05 ) .
the aim of this study was to identify how to effectively use elastic stockings to change 
 the blood flow velocity in the common femoral vein under different ankle positions .
in this study , elastic stockings did not affect the blood flow velocity in the common 
 femoral vein .
