we believe that an optimal surgical strategy and dedicated intensive care allowed the patient to recover from a desperate condition . in conclusion , we report the case of a patient with behcet s disease presenting with a contained aortic rupture in the previous surgical sites of the aortic root , who was treated with a sophisticated surgical approach and postoperative care .
a 38-year - old male patient was referred to asan medical center due to severe shock attributable to contained aortic rupture around the aortic root .
cardiovascular involvement in behcet s disease is a rare but life - threatening condition ; in particular , involvement of the aortic root is known to be the leading cause of death in patients with behcet s disease .
the patient had previously undergone aortic valve surgery three times in another hospital for the management of aortitis and consequent aortic regurgitation associated with underlying behcet s disease .
the patient had been treated with systemic corticosteroids after being diagnosed with behcet s disease 14 years previously .
since observations have revealed that the inflammation in behcet s disease primarily involves the aorto - ventricular junction of the aortic root , the complete resection of the inflammatory tissue in this area has been considered important for preventing the recurrence of the disease . with this in mind , aortic root replacement ( arr ) is considered an ideal surgical option for ar attributable to behcet s disease .
