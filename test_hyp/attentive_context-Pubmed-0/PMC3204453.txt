a double - blind , active - controlled , randomized , parallel , multicenter , prospective , phase iii study was conducted with the approval of the korean food and drug association at 3 centers in the republic of korea from april 2009 to march 2010 , in order to assess the efficacy of erhbmp-2 + -tcp / ha in comparison with -tcp / ha alone for the treatment of tooth extracted sockets .
in this study , -tcp / ha bone grafts coated with erhbmp-2 were found to be more effective in preserving alveolar bone than conventional -tcp / ha alloplastic bone grafts .
therefore , this randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of the erhbmp-2 in alveolar bone regeneration as well as preservation of the -tcp bone graft material that contains erhbmp-2 .
thus , this alloplastic bone graft coated with erhbmp-2 is considered to be an effective bone graft material .
patients were divided into 2 groups : the experiment group who had erhbmp-2 coated tcp / ha ( cowellmedi co , pusan , korea ; 1.5 mg / ml ) and the control group who had tcp / ha graft material alone transplanted immediately into the socket of tooth extraction . at the first visit ,
