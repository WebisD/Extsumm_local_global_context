response to treatment in study groups treatment response after treatment : marked improvement of medial lesion with pdl with compression after 1 month pdl response showed a significant difference in patients with fitzpatrick 's skin type iii and iv ( n = 8 , n = 9 ; p < 0.05 ) .
twenty - four patients with fitzpatrick 's skin type ii - iv with facial or hand lentigines were enrolled in this evaluator - blinded randomized clinical trial .
the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of these modalities in the treatment of solar lentigines .
in addition , side effects in pdl with compression are minimal ( only minimal erythema in a few cases without pih or purpura ) as compared with cryotherapy .
after 1 month , pdl with compression produced more than 75% lightening ( marked improvement ) in 10 patients ( 45.5% ) compared with 2 patients ( 9.1% ) in the cryotherapy group [ table 1 ] .
finally , it seems that the major factor in determining the therapeutic modality for solar lentigines is fitzpatrick 's skin type . in darker skin types such as skin type iii and iv
