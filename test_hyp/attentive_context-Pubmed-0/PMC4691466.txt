when stimulated by microbial products , complement activation peptides , cytokines , et cetera , neutrophils fuse their specific ( a.k.a . , secondary ) granules with their cytoplasmic membrane ( i.e. , specific degranulation ) , thus providing the increased surface - to - volume ratio necessary for locomotion and exposing the cytokine receptors and opsonin receptors required for close endothelial contact and diapedesis ( i.e. , transit ) from the vascular space through the endothelial lining into the tissue interstitial space .
contact and receptor - mediated recognition of an opsonified ( e.g. , complement- , immunoglobulin - labeled ) microbe results in phagocytosis , formation of a phagosome , and fusion with azurophilic ( a.k.a .
the neutrophil serves as the principal leukocyte of the acute inflammatory response and is the primary microbicidal phagocyte of the innate and acquired immune defense systems . accomplishing such
the review provides the background physics and chemistry for a fundamental perspective with regard to oxygen reactivity in particular , neutrophil combustive microbicidal action with its associated luminescence , and reaction chemistry in general .
this mitochondria - independent metabolic activity is required for effective microbicidal action   .
in addition to stimulating neutrophil hyperplasia , that is , increased production , g - csf treatment also results in hypertrophic changes , that is , larger neutrophils with severalfold greater azurophilic granule content and proportionally increased myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) .
