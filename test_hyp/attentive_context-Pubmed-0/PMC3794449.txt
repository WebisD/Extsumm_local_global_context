administration of an antibody ( natalizumab ) to the alpha 4 integrin molecule binding site to the head region of the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( vcam-1 ) molecule was found to be associated with systemic jc viremia and subsequent progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( pml ) in a 60 year old crohn s disease patient who had been previously treated with infliximab and azothioprine . after only 6 administrations of the natalizumab antibody
finally , it is important to point out that caution with the use of natalizumab is strongly advised , as the latest data has revealed an incidence rate of 212 confirmed cases of pml among 99,571 patients treated with natalizumab , equating to 2.1 cases per 1000 treated patients .
since the exact cause of the jc viremia remains unclear in this case , the future therapeutic role for natalizumab in treating multiple sclerosis and other disorders remains uncertain . to help understand the pathogenesis of antibody related jc viremia and subsequent pml , it is hypothesized here that the alpha 4 integrin antibody may disrupt the peripheral binding of the virus in natural tissue reservoirs in certain individuals ; jc viremia after blockade of the normal alpha 4 integrin binding sites for the virus in lymphoid tissue such as spleen and the tonsils could overwhelm the normal cytotoxic t cell immune surveillance defense mechanisms .
