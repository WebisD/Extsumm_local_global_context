our long - term observations showed that population densities of a. whitfieldi and their damage on j. curcas were particularly high in the second half of the rainy season .
established plants always sustain a variable level of flea beetles in the lower part of their crown ( a. s. unpublished observations ) and will act as a source of beetles for young , vulnerable seedlings .
thus , every effort should be made to favor the fast growth of newly planted seedlings in the first part of the rainy season , by planting early and by planting as intercropping with fertilized crops , e.g. , maize .
this study failed to show a significant difference in damage level in the different cropping systems , i.e. , on hedges , monoculture plantations , or intercropping .
second , although the reasons are still unclear , we also showed that a. whitfieldi is more abundant in badly maintained ( i.e. , not weeded ) fields and in the close vicinity of fallows
3 ) . however , the presence or absence of fallow land within or besides the plantation was important , i.e. , a. whitfieldi was significantly more abundant on plants that were in the vicinity of fallows or when the field itself was not weeded ( p  =  0.001 , wald   =  11.97 with all data ; p  =  0.027 , wald   =  4.92 with fields only , df  =  1 ) ( fig .
