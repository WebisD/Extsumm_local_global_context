in particular , we have shown that the mixed ni(0 ) 
 species ( binap)ni(-nc - ph ) containing one bisphosphine 
 and one side - bound nitrile is a particularly active catalyst for the 
 coupling of chloroarenes with primary amines and is more active than 
 the related ( binap)2ni catalyst . a range of electronically 
 varied aryl halides and nitrogen - containing heteroaryl chlorides , 
 including pyridine , quinoline , and isoquinoline derivatives , couple 
 with a variety of aliphatic primary amines in high isolated yields . 
 several aspects of the current system lead to the ability of this 
 first - row metal system to catalyze this class of amination reaction . 
 in general , we attribute the high yields for these amination reactions 
 to the facile oxidative addition of aryl chlorides and heteroaryl 
 chlorides to the ( binap)ni(-nc - ph ) precatalyst 
 at ambient temperatures . detailed studies on the mechanism of 
 the amination reaction
the following conclusions about the mechanism of this 
 coupling process have been drawn from these studies : ( 1 ) the 
 oxidative addition of aryl chlorides to ( binap)ni(-nc - ph ) , together with the stoichiometric reactions of ( binap)niar(cl ) 
 with primary aliphatic amines in the presence of base , support a reaction 
 pathway involving a ni(0)/ni(ii ) couple in the catalytic cycle .
