is identified as a core competency in the practice of science with one example being  evaluating ethical implications of biological research 
( 1 ) . in this report of a 2009 national conference designed to develop a blueprint for real change in biology education , the  ability to understand the relationship between science and society 
many scientist - educators would also like to include in their courses the examination of the future implications of such discoveries , encompassing both the future basic and applied scientific potential as well as the accompanying bioethical dilemmas .
both involve exploring the scientific reaches of new discoveries , but examining bioethical future concerns additionally requires some familiarity with ethical theory and ethical reasoning . in effect , looking forward biologically , we ask  what can we do ?  while looking forward ethically we ask  what should we do and why ?  to educate our students responsibly , and to introduce bioethics effectively , we should not simply allude to future bioethical challenges  thereby raising awareness  but should also help students to begin developing a framework for reasoning through those challenges to some resolution about what ought to be done ethically . since its emergence as a discipline in the 1970s , bioethics has taken shape as an important academic discipline that intersects with the life sciences in myriad ways , and not only with genetic , biomedical , or biotechnological advances
