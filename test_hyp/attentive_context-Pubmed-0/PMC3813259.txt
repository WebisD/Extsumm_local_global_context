the aim of this study is to explore the pharmacokinetic differences of the four flavonoids after oral administration of pure baicalin , radix scutellariae extract and scutellariae - paeoniae couple extract to rats and to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of uc rats with those of normal rats .
the absorption speed of baicalin and wogonoside in the normal pure baicalin group was quicker than those in the normal radix scutellariae and scutellariae - paeoniae couple groups , tmax for baicalin were : ( 0.087  0.02 ) h , ( 0.27  0.03 ) h and ( 0.28  0.03 ) h ; tmax for wogonoside were ( 0.11  0.02 ) h , ( 0.22  0.09 ) h , ( 0.21  0.08 ) h , respectively .
in summary , the results of the present study highlighted that drug  drug interactions , herb  drug interactions and herb  herb interactions always existed and affected the pharmacokinetic behavior of herbal ingredients . statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) in pharmacokinetic parameters of baicalin and wogonoside including cmax and auc(0t ) were obtained among the rats orally administered pure baicalin , radix scutellariae or scutellariae - paeoniae couple extracts .
baicalin and wogonoside had a better absorption effect , which would improve the therapeutic efficacy .
