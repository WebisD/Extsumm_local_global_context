although a ct - based navigation system can allow surgeons to perform more precise procedures at the lower cervical and thoracolumbar spine , it still has some problems in the upper cervical spine , due to the region 's highly variable anatomy . even though there were no catastrophic complications , more experiences
this retrospective study included 25 patients who underwent upper cervical instrumentation , including c1 lateral mass - c2 pedicle screw fixation , between may 2005 and march 2014 .
postoperatively , the precise positions of the c1 lateral mass - c2 pedicle screws were 81.1% ( 47/58 ) ; 8.6% ( 5/58 ) of the screws were in a non - critical breach position and 10.3% ( 6/58 ) of the screws were critical breaches .
most ( 5/6 ) of the critical breaches and all of non - critical breaches were observed at the c2 pedicle screws , and only one case of a c1 lateral mass screw showed a critical breach ( p=0.033 , kruskal - wallis test ) .
we have used the ct - based navigation system in several cervical instrumentation surgeries , and report its safety and efficiency through the comparison of previous reports .
