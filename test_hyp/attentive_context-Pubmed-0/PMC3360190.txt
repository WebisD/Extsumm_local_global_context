we believe that this technique provides a good alternative option in managing the deficient patella in revision total knee arthroplasty , although any prolonged benefits will require long - term follow - up .
our described technique includes connecting wires to the three pegs of the patellar component , passing the wires from the undersurface of the patella to the outer surface through the bone holes and , after compression of a cemented prosthesis , twisting the wires under sufficient tension .
the procedure included augmentation with transcortical wiring of an onlay - type prosthesis in twelve knees ( nine patients ) after it had been determined that conventional resurfacing was inadequate .
also , the problems related with prominent hardware also may occur as is oft en seen with internal fixation of patellar fractures . at a mean 10.3 months follow - up of our series , there was one patellar fracture arising during flexion exercise one week after surgery that was treated with partial patellectomy .
the onlay - type all polyethylene patellar prosthesis is an efficient tool when patellar bone stock is sufficient , being over 10 to 12 mm.5 ) but it is not easy to determine an optimal procedure if bone stock is poor . according to maheshwer et al.,2 )
