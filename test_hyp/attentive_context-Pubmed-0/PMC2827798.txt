zinc isotope separations were studied by displacement chromatography in malate , citrate , lactate and edta systems . the zinc isotope fractionation was confirmed and the lighter isotope was found to be preferentially located on the resin stationary phase .
the average /m value for the isotopic pair of zn / zn was determined to be 1.55    10 which was in agreement with that obtained from benzo crown resins and much larger than that determined in strongly acidic cation exchange resins .
separation coefficients were calculated for each tested system where the edta ligand was found to make a more stable coordination bond with zinc ions that resulted in large  values .
the present study continued the effort to carry out zinc isotope separation by the use of chelating exchange resin .
chromatographic experiments were designed using the four ligands mentioned above in order to elucidate the isotope effect present during zinc complexation .
emphasis was placed on the impact of ligands on the separation coefficient (  ) and the separation coefficient per unit mass differences ( /m ) observed during the separation processes .
