specifically , the neuroimaging of the brain in relation to visual fatigue can yield rich neurophysiologic data to objectively and clinically classify and diagnose onsets of visual fatigue .
, stereoscopic display alignment errors can induce visual fatigue with accompanying underpinning physiological effects associated with visual task performance .
visual fatigue is likely to increase the hemodynamic response in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the brain and delta band waves can be used to predict cognitive fatigue across all the occipital cerebral cortex . to improve 3d or stereoscopic display systems for minimum visual fatigue to the users ,
regrettably , it is well documented that the introduction of three - dimensional displays such 3d tv , high - definition multimedia interface ( hdmi ) desktop , head - mounted display , helmet - mounted display , and 3d glass into consumer markets has resulted in the increase of oculist visits for visual complaints   . from the empirical findings
3d display designs with minimum magnification difference and rotational error are more likely not only to reduce visual fatigue but also to increase performances and satisfaction of the users such as aviators and flight pilots .
the optical axes system in display devices should be designed with minimum magnification difference and rotational error , as these errors were observed to be most prevalent .
