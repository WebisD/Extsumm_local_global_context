we present a unique case , a 10-year - old girl in whom prs presented on the right face , who later had recurrent episodes of monoplegic ataxia .
brain mri revealed very few findings with an increased signal at the ipsilateral hemipons and hemicerebellar peduncle .
the patient , a 10-year - old korean girl , is the younger daughter of two children .
parry - romberg syndrome ( prs ) , or progressive facial hemiatrophy , is a rare disorder presenting as a slowly progressive but self - limited atrophy of facial structures , sometimes followed by wasting of adjacent skin , connective or ocular tissue , muscle , cartilage , and bone1 ) . symptoms usually appear in the first or second decades of life23 ) , but a few cases with a late onset have been described4 ) .
we present a very curious patient with prs who had recurrent monoplegic ataxia due to ipsilateral hemipons involvement without fatal neurological deterioration . because clinical predictors of intracranial abnormalities are poor , neuroimaging
common magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings include ipsilateral high signal intensity in the white matter or gray matter78 ) , leptomeningeal enhancement7 ) , calcification7 ) , cerebral atrophy378 ) , and intracranial vascular malformation9 ) .
