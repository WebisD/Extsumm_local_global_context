summary of shear bond strength values in mpa and failure modes in percentage ( % ) combined ( adhesive and cohesive ) failure
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strength ( sbs ) of two commercial zirconia core ceramics to their corresponding veneering ceramics and microscopic characteristics of bond failure at fracture surface .
within the limitations of the current study it can be concluded that ( 1 ) sbs of veneering porcelain to zirconia core for both cercon and biodenta systems did not show significant difference and ( 2 ) failure mode for biodenta system was mostly adhesive while it was mostly combined ( adhesive and cohesive ) for cercon system .
the biodenta group exhibited mostly adhesive failures [ figure 2 ] ; whereas , the cercon group showed mixed cohesive / adhesive failures [ figure 3 ] .
bond strength is determined by a series of factors including strength of the chemical bonds , mechanical interlocking , type and concentration of defects at the interface , wetting properties , and the degree of compressive stress in the veneering layer due to a difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion between zirconia and the veneering ceramic.  since the mechanical integrity and adhesion of the veneering ceramic to the ceramic substructure have proven to be key factors for the successful performance of veneer / core bilayered restorations , the initial bond strength and their reliability after thermocycling obtained from in vitro investigations can provide useful information for the behavior and predictability of y - tzp all - ceramic systems in clinical application .
