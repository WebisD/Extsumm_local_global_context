this could represent a significant step forward in the management of a condition that can prove very difficult to treat .
, we would like to suggest that ibis also warrant consideration in the treatment of children with eyelid hemangiomas where conventional modalities have been unsuccessful or where treatment with beta - blockers may be contraindicated .
bleomycin was first isolated in 1966 by umezawa from a soil fungus , streptomyces verticillus .
pulmonary fibrosis is the most important dose - dependent complication of systemic bleomycin therapy but has not been reported after ibis . in one study ,
a 3-month - old girl was referred to our tertiary eye clinic with a large capillary hemangioma covering her forehead , nose and the left side of her face [ fig . 1 ] .
the side - effect profile of ibis therefore compares favorably with that of conventional treatment modalities . based on our experience
ten months later , after nine injections of intralesional bleomycin , the left visual axis is completely cleared and all treated areas show marked improvement a 10-week - old girl was referred to our clinic with a right periocular capillary hemangioma after earlier debulking surgery had not cleared the visual axis .
