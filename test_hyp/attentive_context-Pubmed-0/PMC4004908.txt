we converted 10 
 of our cah patients from ca to hc substitution therapy , compared clinical and laboratory 
 findings before and after the change .
whorwood and warne ( 4 ) determined urinary tetrahydrocortisone ( the ) / 
 tetrahydrocortisol ( thf ) ratios for 14 cah patients treated with ca , and found that better 
 control of the disease was associated with lower the / thf ratios .
in 10 patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency , we changed the glucocorticoid for the 
 substitution therapy from ca to hc .
treatment with hc is recommended for these patients as well . however , since hc has been 
 reported to be too bioavailable to maintain cortisol concentrations within physiologic 
 limits ( 11 ) , careful evaluation of physiologic 
 aspects of hc - based substitution regimens may be needed .
ca would seem inadequate for substitution 
 therapy not only in patients with cah , but also those with other forms of adrenal 
 insufficiency such as adrenal hypoplasia or hypofunction caused by pituitary disorders . 

congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( cah ) is caused by deficiency of 21-hydroxylase in the 
 adrenal glands .
cortisone acetate ( ca ) is used worldwide as an equivalent to hydrocortisone 
 ( hc ) , as the glucocorticoid component of substitution therapy for cah .
