this study was planned to evaluate the effect of 21.3% aluminum chloride , 0.05% oxymetazoline hydrochloride , and expasyl paste on smear layer .
the study protocol consisted of : 
 determination of ph of three different gingival retraction systemspreparation of tooth specimens for scanning electron microscope ( sem ) examinationprocessing of specimens for sem examination . 
 
determination of ph of three different gingival retraction systems preparation of tooth specimens for scanning electron microscope ( sem ) examination processing of specimens for sem examination .
hence , liquid hemostatic solution , i.e. , groups a and b , was allowed to remain in contact with prepared tooth for 10 min . in our study , ph of all three groups were determined by ph meter and found that group a , i.e. , 21.3% aluminum chloride had least ph of 1.82 followed by group c , i.e. , expasyl paste containing kaolin and aluminum chloride , of 3.86 .
results of this study need to be verified with other chemicals with variation in timeresults of the study are to be evaluated on other teeth of both maxillary and mandibular arch .
