proceeded to perform more stringent tests of the model by asking how it would respond to four perturbations : extinction of the expression of the delta gene , global expression of the pmar1 gene , extinction of hox11/13b expression , and most challengingly , the transplantation of four cleavage skeletogenic micromeres into the animal pole of an otherwise normal embryo that possessed its own set of four micromeres at the vegetal pole .
this may not seem surprising because the grn is based on interpretations of huge masses of expression data , perturbation data and cis - regulatory data .
is it possible to apply the general computational framework to test grn models derived from biological processes in addition to development , such as immunology and postnatal neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of the brain to mention only two of many frontiers before us that beckon for the grn approach ? with the advances of next generation sequencing technology and its cost now rocketing downward , a large amount of data will soon be in hand for various biological processes across diverse phyla .
