in addition , we aimed to analyze the relationships between selected polymorphisms and the parameters of lipid profile , including tch , ldl , hdl , tg , sex hormones , including tst , fts , e2 , dheas , shbg , and anthropometric parameters , including bmi , wc , and abp in middle - aged and elderly men , which may contribute to increased knowledge about the mutual relationships between metabolic and sex hormone disorders in aging men .
the fto rs9939609 and mc4r rs17782313 gene polymorphisms have little significant relationships with metabolic health problems ( t2 dm , ht , overweight and obesity , and lipid disorders ) and do not result in androgen disorders in aging men
this study showed no connection between the ppar ( rs1801282 ) polymorphism and the studied continuous variables . in the final step of our experiments , we aimed to establish whether recessive genotypes of the polymorphisms determined any of the clinical conditions ( t2 dm , mets , ht , overweight , and obesity ) , or continuous variables  anthropometric , hormonal , and metabolic indices  by means of logistic regression .
we also found no links between the presence of these polymorphisms and the levels of the tested hormones ( tst , fts , e2 , and dheas ) and shbg . with regard to biochemical parameters
