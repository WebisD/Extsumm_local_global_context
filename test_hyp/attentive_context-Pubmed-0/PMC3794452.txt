therefore , we intended to analyze the effect of -511 c / t polymorphism on il - i secretion from lps - induced lymphocytes in an attempt to reveal the possible role of this particular polymorhism in the etiopathogenesis of mtle - hs .
since il-1-511 t allele has been suggested to be associated with increased in vitro production of il-1 and that il-1 is involved in hs pathogenesis , we also analyzed the il-1 secretion between the patients and control individuals who carry the t allele at position -511 of the il-1 gene .
in addition , despite the fact that both spontaneous and stimulated secretion levels of il-1 were higher in mtle - hs patients who carry the t allele with respect to those patients who do not , the difference was not statistically significant ( figure 2 ) .
levels of secreted il-1 from the cultured lymphocytes incubated either with or without lps were measured at three different time frames during the culture period ( basal , 4 h and 24 h ) .
however , although spontaneous secretion levels of il-1 were higher in mtle - hs patients , there was no significant difference between the groups ( figure 1 ) .
