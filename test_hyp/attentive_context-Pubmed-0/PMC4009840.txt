the folding and assembly of proteins and protein complexes is essential for all aspects of cellular function , with profound consequences on the long - term health of the cell , as well as organismal lifespan [ 1 - 5 ] .
the challenge to proteome stability over the course of a lifespan is substantial and is impacted by mutations , expressed polymorphisms and intrinsic errors in gene expression on the one hand [ 5 - 7 ] , and by the acute effects of environmental and metabolic stresses on the other [ 8 - 12 ] .
because proteomic composition and stability are dynamic over the lifespan of an organism , the functional status of the proteome is also constantly monitored by stress signaling pathways so as to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation [ 5 , 13 - 15 ] .
proteostasis is , therefore , closely associated with the regulation of stress response pathways , including the heat shock response , the unfolded protein responses   , the oxidative stress response , and the metabolic stress response   . over - expression of thecorresponding stress response transcription factors , such as hsf-1 , atf-6 and ire-1 , skn-1 , and daf-16 , or enhancing the activity of chaperones , the ubiquitin proteasome system or autophagy , all have significant beneficial effects on lifespan extension and suppression of age - related misfolding diseases [ 12 , 19 - 24 ] .
