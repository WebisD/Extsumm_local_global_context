the most detailed evaluation to date of these systems is the merit study from australia , which was a multicentre cluster randomised trial of mets .
the continued inability of studies to demonstrate the efficacy of ccos and a complete lack of evidence for cost - effectiveness is worrying . a recent guideline by the national institute for health and clinical excellence on the management of the acutely ill hospital patient was unable to recommend outreach services due to a lack of supportive evidence .
the services were founded in australia in the 1990s with the concept of mets using the well - recognised principle that early recognition and aggressive intervention improves outcome from critical illness .
the analysis was performed on the intensive care national audit & research centre case - mix programme ( a high - quality clinical database of nearly 400,000 icu admissions ) and on data taken from a large national survey of ccos . a range of outcomes designed to ' reflect the ccos objectives of averting admissions , ensuring timely admission and enabling discharge were investigated ' , including the proportion of admissions direct from wards , the length of icu stay , icu mortality and hospital mortality . sadly , despite reductions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates and physiological disturbance in the time before icu admission , ccos were not associated with an improvement in icu mortality or hospital mortality .
