given the role of pai-1 in these tumor processes , the in vivo data showing fda - approved tzds decrease pai-1 in diabetic patients , and our results and those of others , one could draw the conclusion that tzd therapies may eventually prove to be a valid adjuvant therapy for some breast cancer patients .
the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of ppar- ligands on breast cancer cell motility and the plasminogen activator system .
our collective results suggest that the ppar- ligand ciglitazone decreases cell motility , in a ppar- independent manner , potentially though the down - regulation of pai-1 ; alternatively , the ppar- ligand ara promotes migration in a ppar- dependent manner that increases upa .
additionally , we found ciglitazone treatment reduces pai-1 protein levels , and this effect was not reversed by antagonism of ppar-. we hypothesize that the antimigratory effects of ciglitazone are mediated by the alteration of the pa system in these cells .
this study shows ciglitazone treatment reduces both normal and malignant epithelial cell migration in vitro , independently of ppar- activation .
the naturally occurring ppar ligand 15d - pgj2 also reduced wound - induced cell migration . interestingly , treatment with the -6 fatty acid arachidonic acid ( ara ) increased cell motility , while the -3 fatty acid docosahexanoic acid ( dha ) had no significant effect .
