qualitative studies have revealed that many doctors and nurses report both improved and worsening efficiency.2628 improved sharing of medication information is possible with cpoe , but reduced face - to - face communication between clinicians has also been identified as a potentially negative impact of system introduction , but there is little quantitative evidence to clarify this issue.15 
 29 we aimed to undertake a large controlled time and motion study of hospital doctors and nurses to measure whether the proportions of time spent in medication tasks , direct care , and communication with each other significantly changed following the introduction of an emms with electronic prescribing and emar .
the body of evidence regarding the impact of these systems on doctors and nurses work on general hospital wards is relatively sparse and reliance continues to be placed on results from important early studies.5

 13 significant advances have been made in understanding the ways in which systems may disrupt and enhance work patterns and qualitative studies have played a vital role in understanding the complex socio - technical issues associated with integrating information systems into clinical work.1419 however , concerns of clinicians regarding the impact that systems have on the efficiency of their work continue to be raised and are a significant barrier to adoption.2022 prior to the imminent introduction of an electronic medication management system ( emms ) ( with electronic prescribing and medication administration records ( emar ) ) , we interviewed 50 hospital clinicians ( doctors and nurses ) and managers to determine their expectations of system introduction.23 work practice change associated with the system was the most strongly and frequently raised issue by all groups.23 specific issues often center on the perceived increased time it takes for doctors to prescribe medications and for nurses to perform medication administration using a computer compared to paper medication charts.7

 24 as a result of this , there are concerns that there will be less time for clinicians to spend on direct patient care activities.20 these beliefs are often in contrast to the system benefits promoted to clinicians , namely that information systems will improve efficiency and patient care.21 
 25 time savings are anticipated by re - distributing time across medication tasks.12 for example , while it may take longer to type a prescription compared to writing it , the ability to modify existing orders rather than prepare new orders and to use ordersets is expected to save time
