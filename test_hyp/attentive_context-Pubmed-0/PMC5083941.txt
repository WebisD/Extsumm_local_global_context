now a days , its use is not limited to treat narcolepsy and other sleep wake disorders , but also in chronic fatigue syndrome , treatment resistant depression , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cocaine dependency.1 ) reportedly it has a much lower abuse potential but some have also suggested it to be having a definite potential for dependence.2 ) here we report a rare case of modafinil dependence who presented with hypersexuality behavior . till date , only one such similar case have been reported.3 )
modafinil , a novel wake - promoting drug has gained immense popularity among psychiatrists in recent times .
inspite of reportedly low abuse potential , we report a case of modafinil dependence and modafinil induced hypersexuality so as to increase awareness regarding this rare side effect of modafinil and for the need of regulation on its sale .
our case escalated the dose of modafinil so as to overcome fatigue , increase energy and improve concentration . later on , to overcome the fear of relapsing into depression he increased to a supratherapeutic dosage of 1,000 mg / day and started having symptoms which fulfilled the criteria of hypersexuality disorder ( as per kafka s criteria).6 ) these symptoms were temporally correlated with increment in dose of modafinil and subsided on decreasing the dose of the same in a controlled environment . hence , as neither any other drug used in the index case could be linked with such kind of behavior nor was there any switch to mania / hypomania / mixed episode which could explain such change in behavior , we concluded that the symptoms of hypersexual behavior was induced by modafinil .
