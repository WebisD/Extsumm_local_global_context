a 21-year - old man , who was an iv drug abuser , presented with fever and dyspnea .
cardiac surgery should be considered to debride abscesses , allowing the eradication of uncontrolled infection , and to reconstruct cardiac structures , restoring homodynamic and alleviating congestive heart failure .
cardiac surgery should be considered in patients with perivalvular abscess and intracardiac fistula to debride abscesses and to reconstruct cardiac structures , restoring homodynamic and alleviating congestive heart failure .
ie is a serious complication of iv drug abuse , with a reported mortality of 5 to 10%.1 endocarditis in iv drug abusers commonly involves the tricuspid valve , and staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism .
tee revealed severe aortic insufficiency , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , and an echo - lucent space between the tricuspid and aortic valves ( figures 1 ) .
tee is superior to tte for detecting invasive infection in patients with nve and prosthetic valve endocarditis ( pve ) .
the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) for the detection of vegetations in patients with native valve endocarditis ( nve ) is approximately 65% , whereas that of transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) in these patients is 85 to 95%.2 tee is the preferred approach in patients in whom tte is technically suboptimal and is the procedure of choice for imaging the pulmonic valve.3 when initial tee is negative and the clinical suspicion of ie remains , repeating tee within 7 to 10 days is advocated.4 perivalvular abscess or intracardiac fistula formation occurs in 10 to 14% of patients with nve.6 persistent , otherwise unexplained , fever despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy in patients with ie suggests infection extending beyond the valve leaflet .
