therefore , the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of 
 different heights of the hands of the supporting arms on the loads on the shoulder joint 
 during transfer movements in order to seek effective and safe transfer methods .
the purpose of the present study was to analyze the movements of the shoulder joint and the 
 trunk at different heights of the th and the lh in spt movements to provide reference data 
 for effective and safe transfer methods for spinal cord injury , paraplegia , and lower 
 extremity amputation patients .
the results of the present 
 study can be applied as guidelines for effective and safe methods for quadriplegia or spinal 
 cord injury patients spt , and can be utilized as reference data when considering the 
 appropriate heights of aids for wheelchairs .
hl : low hand height ( 40  cm ) , hn : normal hand height ( 50  cm ) , * p<0.05 the values of anterior / posterior force measured at the force plates below the th and lh 
 when the hand positions were low and normal were 8.98 ( 1.96)% ( bw ) and 7.89 ( 1.96)% ( bw ) , 
 respectively , at the th , and the difference was significant ( p<0.05 ) , but there was no 
 significant difference at the lh .
