the mgda test for the rapid detection of inh and rif resistance is an 
 inexpensive , easy to perform and interpretable method that can be used in laboratories 
 for routine drug susceptibility testing .
the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , negative predictive value 
 ( npv ) and agreement of the mgda test for inh were 92.5% , 91.3% , 92.5% , 91.3% and 92% , 
 respectively .
two additional isolates were sensitive to inh by the reference method , 
 but resistant by the mgda test . for rif , the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , npv and 
 agreement of the mgda test were 94.7% , 100% , 100% , 96.8% and 98% , respectively .
( 2008 ) reported that mgda could be 
 used for the rapid detection of drug susceptibilities of m. 
 tuberculosis clinical isolates ; the sensitivity , specificity and agreement 
 of the mgda test were found to be 100% for both rif and inh and the results were 
 obtained within six-17 days ( average of 12 days ) . in our study , the inh - rif 
 sensitivities , specificities , ppvs , npvs and agreements of the mgda test were 
 92.5 - 94.7% , 91.3 - 100% , 92.5 - 100% , 91.3 - 96.8% and 92 - 98% , respectively and the results 
 were obtained within eight - nine days .
