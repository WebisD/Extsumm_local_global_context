we also report the correlation between the years of meditation experience and the level of mindfulness .
consistent practice of moving meditation practices like cm can lead to development of higher levels of mindfulness .
this furthers the scope for clinical trials with cm as an intervention in the management of psychological disorders .
we found a positive correlation ( r = 0.620 ) between the years of meditation practice and the levels of trait mindfulness .
in the present study , we studied trait mindfulness and its correlation with duration of meditation practice using a maas .
this may positively impact mental states and attention , which can in turn help psychological well - being of individuals .
maas scores were significantly higher in meditators as compared to with the non - meditators ( independent samples t - test , t = 10.391 , p < 0.001 ) . the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the levels of mindfulness trait between meditators and non - meditators was ( 1.05 , 1.55 ) .
the meditation technique practiced in the current study comprises all these components , which justifies the higher levels of mindfulness in the meditation group . also , higher levels of trait mindfulness in cm practitioner can be accredited to the years of cm practice , which would have lead to the development of mindful trait in the meditators as signified by the positive correlation between level of mindfulness and the duration of meditation practice .
