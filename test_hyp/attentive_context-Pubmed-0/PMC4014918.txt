glp1 secretion was associated with pg during ogtt , and basal insulin secretion ( homa cell ) and gip secretion was associated with bmi and earlyphase insulin secretion ( insulinogenic index ) .
was not associated with auc of ffa , but was positively associated with bmi , homair , and auc of iri and cpr after glucose loading .
the subjects were diagnosed ngt according to who criteria with fasting plasma glucose and 2h glucose levels below 6.1 and 7.8  mmol / l , respectively .
we then analyzed the relationship between aucgip or aucglp1 and indices of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity .
the factors responsible for incretin secretion have been reported in caucasian subjects , but have not been thoroughly elucidated in japanese subjects . in the present study , we evaluated gip and glp1 levels during ogtt and determined the factors involved in gip and glp1 secretion ( area under the curve [ auc ] of gip and glp1 during ogtt ) in japanese ngt subjects .
are increased in obese subjects and there is a positive relationship between aucgip and auc of ffa during ogtt . in the present study , aucgip after glucose loading
