dialysis patients in group ii had greater odds of death ( odds ratio ( or ) , 1.76 , 95% confidence intervals ( 95% ci ) , 1.40 , 2.22 ) ) , those in group iii were more than twice likely to die ( or 2.20 , 95% ci , 1.792.71 ) , whereas patients in group iv were less likely to die compared to group i ( or 0.39 , 95% ci , 0.29 , 0.52 ) .
group iii patients ( those with > 3 times increase in creatinine prior to dialysis ) had the lowest levels of creatinine or bun on icu admission .
the frequencies of patients admitted with primary icu admission diagnoses of kidney disorders or electrolyte and metabolic disorders significantly varied across four groups and were 24% and 21% , respectively , in group iv ( < 0.3  mg / dl increase in creatinine before dialysis ) compared with only 1.9% and 2.1% in group iii ( > 3 times increase in creatinine before dialysis ) .
we interpret the data to suggest that prospective studies aimed at examining therapeutic interventions in aki requiring dialysis ( e.g. , timing of dialysis initiation ) would need to consider both the degree of kidney injury sustained prior to dialysis initiation and overall severity of illness , prior to performing equitable comparisons .
