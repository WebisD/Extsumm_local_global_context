the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of honey native to india at various concentrations against pseudomonas aeruginosa causing wound infection and its comparison with antibiotics and dettol .
this intriguing observation may have important clinical implications and could lead to a new approach for treating multidrug resistant p. aeruginosa infected wounds using honey of indian origin .
percentage of susceptibility pattern to different class of antibiotics to pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates used in the study the effects of honey on all the isolates of p. aeruginosa were studied by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) , indicating the highest dilution of honey in the culture medium which inhibits the growth of p. aeruginosa isolates .
all strains of p. aeruginosa including both resistant phenotypes and sensitive strains were inhibited at 20% antibacterial honey concentrations in vitro .
the mic of all the 50 strains ( 100% ) to honey was found to be 20% , of which 19 strains ( 38% ) were having an mic of 15% including the standard strain of p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 .
the present study shows the bactericidal activity of honey against p. aeruginosa strains . as honey
honey at concentrations of 20% , 25% , 50% could bring out complete destruction in 24 h , whereas concentration of honey at 75% and 100% could bring about complete destruction of p. aeruginosa in 12 h [ table 1 ] .
