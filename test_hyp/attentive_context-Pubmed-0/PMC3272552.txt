the aim of this study was to compare the outcomes in patients who underwent surgery in 1985 to 1989 ( before the widespread use of medical therapy for bph ) , in 1995 to 1999 ( when medical therapy was developed and began to be prescribed as alternative treatment to surgery ) , and in 2005 to 2009 ( when medical therapy superseded surgical intervention to become first - line treatment and when combination therapy became widely adopted ) .
medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients who underwent surgery for bph from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 1989 ( group 1 ) , from 1 january 1995 to 31 december 1999 ( group 2 ) , and from 1 january 2005 to 31 december 2009 ( group 3 ) .
perioperative and postoperative parameters were investigated representatively in patients who underwent turp , who were divided into 3 subgroups according to time period : 1985 to 1989 ( subgroup 1 ) , 1995 to 1999 ( subgroup 2 ) , and 2005 to 2009 ( subgroup 3 ) . transfusion and the weight of the resected tissue were evaluated as operative parameters . the postoperative course was evaluated on the basis of length of hospital stay , the postoperative day on which the catheter was removed , and postoperative complications .
