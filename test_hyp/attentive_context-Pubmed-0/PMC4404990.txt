it is indicated for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunctive therapy to diet.7,8 the aim of this article is to review the pharmacologic , pharmacokinetic , efficacy , and safety data of pitavastatin specifically in older populations .
it has been well established that elevated serum cholesterol levels are associated with increasing cardiovascular risk as the population ages.13 meta - analyses have suggested significantly higher cardiovascular mortality rates in older individuals compared with their younger cohorts , with a 10-fold higher risk seen with every 38.6 mg / dl increase in total cholesterol ( tc ) seen.2 trials with statins in older patients ( > 65 years of age ) with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease show significant reductions in total mortality ( relative risk 0.78 , 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.89).4 thus , prescribing cholesterol - lowering therapy in the form of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in older patients is of considerable benefit . with the practice - shifting changes made with the most recent american college of cardiology / american heart association guidelines for treating blood cholesterol ,
this can be particularly troublesome with the development of frailty which increases patients susceptibility to adverse events.1,6 therefore , it is imperative that practitioners have not only a working knowledge of information related to statins , but more specifically to their efficacy and safety in older populations
