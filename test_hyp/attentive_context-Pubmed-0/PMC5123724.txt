the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of epidural morphine and bupivacaine in patients with chronic neuropathic pain associated with lumbosacral radiculopathy .
in this study , we evaluated pain improvement after the cessation of epidural treatment with morphine and bupivacaine . at follow - up ,
the present results showed significant efficacy of combined epidural morphine and bupivacaine in the treatment of radicular neuropathic pain , which was maintained for up to 1 month after the end of administration . as a result of multiple pathophysiological events
half of the patients suffering from moderate - to - severe pain at baseline reported a significant improvement , which was confirmed with two validated scores , affecting the sensory and evaluative as much as affective aspects of pain . to our knowledge , this is the first study to report the effectiveness of epidural treatment with combined opioids and anesthetics persisting after catheter removal .
the oswestry disability index was applied for clinical purposes and showed an overall improvement at follow - up . nevertheless , considering the frequent association with low back pain , disability caused by axial pain
maintaining significant pain relief with low doses of epidural bupivacaine / opioid may allow the physician to minimize adverse effects , neurotoxicity , and drug dosages , or to adopt more conservative approaches ( eg , physical therapy ) in pain management .
