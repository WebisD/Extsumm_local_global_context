, as well as multidrug - resistant cocci such as mrsa and vre , which have acquired an extraordinarily high level of resistance to various aminoglycosides through production of 16s rrna methylases , especially in clinical environments .
as described previously , arbekacin still shows a very broad antimicrobial spectrum from gram - positive to gram - negative nosocomial microbes and has been approved solely to treat methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) infections in japan since 1990 to ensure the prudent use of this agent .
the use of semisynthetic aminoglycosides , including arbekacin , in japanese clinical settings for > 10 years may have promoted the emergence and dissemination of the 16s rrna methylase - producing gram - negative microbes in japan .
the large amount of various aminoglycosides used in livestock - farming environments could have also been a selective pressure for the emergence and spread of pathogenic microbes that harbor genetic determinants for the newly identified 16s rrna methylases , as exemplified by recent isolation of arma - producing e. coli from swine in spain ( genbank accession no .
the emergence and presence of the 16s rrna methylase - producing gram - negative bacilli , however , has not been well recognized in japan to date ; arbekacin has not been listed among the antimicrobial agents for daily antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram - negative microbes .
