with respect to paired t - tests , both comparisons of the means between the femtosecond laser and the microkeratome group using either ocp or confocal microscopy were statistically significant ( p<0.001 ) , while the difference between the type of measurement ( ocp or confocal microscopy ) for either group was not ( figure 1 ) .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the flap predictability and the visual outcomes during a follow - up period of 6 months , investigating the potential advantages or disadvantages regarding both flap creation technologies .
the udva was significantly increased at the end of the first week ( p=0.0043 ; mean : 0.0020.13 logmar ) and at the end of the first postoperative month when compared to the baseline cdva ( p=0.001 ; mean : 0.0410.13 ) .
the study included patients with the following types of refractive errors : myopia from 0.75 to 7.0 ; hyperopia ; and astigmatism < + 4.0 d. central corneal thickness was measured using corneal topography ( orbscan ii version 3.0 ; bausch & lomb zyoptix ) and was at least 500 m or more .
in the microkeratome ( amadeus ii ) group , the efficiency index at the first day , and until the first week after surgery , was reduced ( p<0.0001 ) .
