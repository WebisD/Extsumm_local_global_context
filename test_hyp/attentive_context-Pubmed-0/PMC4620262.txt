inkt cells are innate - like effector lymphocytes that not only are directly cytotoxic , but also possess the unique ability to nucleate the antitumor responses of other effector lymphocytes and alter the cellular and angiogenic makeup of the tumor microenvironment . as such , the promise of an effective inkt cell - based immunotherapy can only be realized by devising and evaluating strategies that simultaneously maximize each of these antitumor effector mechanisms . the challenge for the future will thus be to identify these strategies and apply them to tumors against which inkt cells wield the most optimal responses .
natural killer t ( nkt ) cells are innate - like lymphocytes typified by coexpression of receptors characteristic of natural killer and conventional t cells . as such , murine nkt cells generally bear ly49 receptors , nkg2 family of receptors , cd94 , and nk1.1 ( the latter only being expressed in specific strains , including the commonly used c57bl/6 ) .
both human and mouse nkt cells display a variety of stimulatory and inhibitory t cell - associated receptors and ligands ( e.g. , cd28 and cd154 ) , whose expression depends on the activation status of the cell .
