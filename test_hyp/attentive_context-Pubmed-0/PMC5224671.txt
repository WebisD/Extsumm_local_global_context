the aim of our study was to analyze epidemiological features of our patients with dilated heart of mild to moderate systolic dysfunction , who were at sinus rhythm .
therefore , these patients should be watched more carefully and possibly initiate the anticoagulation therapy , despite the fact that they are in sinus rhythm and their lv systolic function is not severely impaired .
male patients with dilated cardiomyopathy at sinus rhythm with lower body weight tend to have larger la and consequently might be at higher risk of developing atrial thrombus and its subsequent consequences .
la diameter and its normalization for body surface area ( bsa ) were significantly greater in favor of patients with a history of cad ( 46.93  4.98 mm vs. 44.70  4.68 mm , p = 0.024 ; 24.10  3.16 mm / m vs. 22.68  2.76 mm / m , p = 0.02 , respectively ) .
our main aim was to analyze the relationship and prediction of these epidemiological data to la and laa size and function as predisposing features of thromboembolic events .
relevant relationships among epidemiological and echocardiographic parameters of left atrium diameter , area , and volume assessed by transthoracic echocardiography in all patients ( n=101 ) cad = coronary artery disease , bmi = body mass index , bsa = body surface area , dm = diabetes mellitus , la = left atrium , lav = left atrial volume analysis of relationship among clinical parameters and tee assessed laa area and function [ table 5 ] showed that older age , lower weight , lower bmi , and presence of hypertension were significantly related to lower laa ef .
