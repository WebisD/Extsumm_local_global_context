depiction of the structures of the derivatized c60 vectors ; the positively charged amino - c60 compounds ( iiv ) , the neutral serinolamide - c60 compound ( v ) , and the negatively charged c3-c60 compound ( vi ) ( chemical structures depicted at neutral ph in aqueous solution ; counterions in solution not shown ) .
. herein we report transfection efficiencies , cytotoxicity profiles , and biophysical structure / activity studies for a new class of water - soluble c60 vectors prepared using the hirschbingel reaction which is one of the simplest , highest - yielding , and most versatile c60 functionalization methods known . as shown in figure 1 ,
the successful demonstration of intracellular dna uptake , intracellular transport , and gene expression from dna using c60 vectors suggests the possibility of developing analogous gd@c60-based vectors to serve simultaneously as both therapeutic and diagnostic agents .
these vectors , which have been analyzed for their ability to promote dna transfection , offer the opportunity to elucidate the roles that hydrophobicity ( due to the fullerene core ) , hydrophilicity ( due to the water soluble substituents ) , and overall charge state displayed by the c60 derivatives have on dna transfection , gene expression , and cytotoxicity .
