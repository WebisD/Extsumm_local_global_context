the use of semitendinosus for acl reconstruction with preservation of its distal insertion should be the gold standard in skeletally immature patients .
the most noteworthy findings in the current study were : 1 ) the semitendinosus graft did not undergo full ligamentization and , after 48  weeks , its original appearance at the microstructural level was different ; 2 ) a marked reduction of cellular necrosis was observed in the early phase of the neo - ligament healing process .
the study was performed on growing animals to determine the type and the extent of the lesions that develop in the intrarticular tract .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the morphological and histological changes that occur in the intra - articular tract of a semitendinosus tendon , when used to reconstruct the acl in growing rabbits , preserving its distal insertion .
however , the minor surgical cases and the rarity of degenerative disease in this population make second - look arthroscopy extremely rare and conditioned by small percentage of biopsies taken from the center of the graft .
despite the time points of the samples explanted were not completely overlapped , in the first month after surgery the results were similar ( absence of avascular necrosis , disorganized collagen fibers ) .
