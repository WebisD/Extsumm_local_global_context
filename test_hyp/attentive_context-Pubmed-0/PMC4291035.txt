we further investigate the pmfs and interfacial fluctuations 
 as single gdm / urea approach this aqueous protein hydrophobic 
 interface , demonstrating the resemblance between liquid 
we begin with discussion of potentials 
 of mean force ( pmfs ) and interfacial fluctuations as single gdm / urea cross the aqueous liquid  vapor interface .
the context in which we consider the present work is relevant 
 for discussion of the nature of direct chemical interactions between 
 typical chemical denaturants of proteins , gdm and urea , 
 specifically at hydrophobic regions of a model protein , hfbii .
our results for both the protein  water 
 interface and the pure liquid  vapor interface are in agreement 
 with previous studies .
ii we discuss 
 the simulation protocols and computational details 
 of the liquid  vapor interface and aqueous protein interfaces . 

in this article , we continue to explore and 
 demonstrate a connection 
 between interfacial stability and induced interfacial fluctuations 
 as interfacially stable solutes approach ostensibly hydrophobic aqueous 
our analysis of simulation data from 1 m gdm solutions 
 with no restraints demonstrates a propensity for the gdm to the hydrophobic region .
we 
 consider gdm / urea density distributions around the aqueous 
 hfbii hydrophobic interface in 1.0 m solutions in 
 the second part .
