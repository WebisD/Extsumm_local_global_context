ha when applied to patients with chronic periodontitis showed reduction in bleeding on probing ( bop ) , probing pocket depth ( ppd ) , and clinical attachment level , and hence , can be used as an adjunct to scaling and root planning .
a 24-year - old female reported to the department of periodontics with her esthetic concern and complaint regarding the loss of interdental papilla , i.e. black triangle , in the anterior maxillary region [ figure 1 ] .
this study indicates possible improvements in regenerating lost interdental papilla and removal of black triangle by injecting ha into the lost papilla using a nonsurgical approach . because of its property of modulating periodontal wounds ,
this nonsurgical approach limits the use of surgical procedures for regenerating lost papilla , and hence , it is a noninvasive method and also reduces patient discomfort .
therefore , this study demonstrates ha to be a nonsurgical approach for regenerating lost papilla and gave significant and satisfactory results . to overcome the limitations of using of ha for regenerating lost papilla , this study need to be elaborated with more number of patients depending upon the size of the black triangle .
