fvc , fvc% , and fev1 levels were significantly increased after the hemodialysis session ( p<0.05 ) . as regards the bia parameters , oh / ecw% were significantly lower in post - hd patients compared to pre - hd patients ( p<0.05 ) .
fvc , fvc% , fev1 , fev1% , fef2575 , fef2575% , pefr , and pefr% were significantly lower in patients with fluid overload than in those without fluid overload ( p<0.05 ) .
male sex and increased ultrafiltration volume were independently associated with higher fvc , whereas increased age and oh / ecw% ratio were independently associated with lower fvc ( r=0.569 , p<0.001 , table 5 ) .
there were significant negative correlations between oh / ecw and fvc , fvc% , fev1 , fev1% , fef2575 , fef2575% , pefr , and pefr% ( table 4 ) .
we particularly focussed on the relationship between pulmonary function and fluid status in esrd patients on regular hemodialysis , using a novel bioelectrical impedance analysis device to measure the fluid status .
the present study indicates that fluid overload is closely associated with restrictive and obstructive respiratory abnormalities in patients with end - stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis treatment . in addition
