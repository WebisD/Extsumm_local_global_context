earlier studies have shown that mosquito cell line or a susceptible mosquito , once infected with an arbovirus , does not get infected from subsequent infection with another virus of the same group1011121314151617 .
tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes ( intrathoracic inoculation method ) ; ( a ) differential yield of jev in mosquitoes infected simultaneously with bagv to mosquitoes infected with jev alone ; ( b ) differential yield of jev in mosquitoes previously infected with bagv to mosquitoes infected with jev alone ; ( c ) differential yield of wnv in mosquitoes infected simultaneously with bagv to mosquitoes infected with wnv alone ; ( d ) differential yield of wnv in mosquitoes previously infected with bagv to mosquitoes infected with wnv alone .
it was observed that mosquito cell lines persistently infected with sindbis virus altered the productivity of other togaviruses in the cell lines upon subsequent infection .
the unfolding of the mechanism , therefore , would have great epidemiological significance as viruses of less pathogenicity could be used as a tool to control / limit the spread of highly pathogenic mosquito borne viruses such as jev , wnv and other encephalitis causing viruses .
quinquefasciatus mosquitoes ( intrathoracic inoculation method ) ; ( a ) differential yield of jev in mosquitoes infected simultaneously with bagv to mosquitoes infected with jev alone ; ( b ) differential yield of jev in mosquitoes previously infected with bagv to mosquitoes infected with jev alone ; ( c ) differential yield of wnv in mosquitoes infected simultaneously with bagv to mosquitoes infected with wnv alone ; ( d ) differential yield of wnv in mosquitoes previously infected with bagv to mosquitoes infected with wnv alone .
