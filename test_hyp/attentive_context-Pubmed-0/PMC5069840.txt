, we report a case of non - luminal her-2/neu - positive breast cancer in a patient without history of sarcoidosis and initially suspected to have metastatic disease . 

furthermore , the present case report highlights the importance of histological determination in lymph nodes for distinguishing metastasis from sarcoidosis .
a 52-year - old woman was presented to our hospital . she noted a lump in her left breast during self - examination .
the correlation between sarcoidosis and malignancy remains unclear , despite that this topic has been increasingly investigated . in this article
this case report emphasizes the importance of differential diagnosis of lymph node involvement in cancer patients .
the diagnosis is established on the basis of compatible clinical and radiological findings and supported by histological evidence in one or more organs of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas in the absence of organisms or particles 
 .
this study reports a case of non - luminal her-2/neu - positive breast cancer in a patient presenting non - caseating epithelioid cell granulomas of sarcoidosis after treatment and initially suspected to have metastatic disease .
urgent histodiagnosis revealed clear margins and demonstrated a lump in the breast , which was identified as infiltrative carcinoma .
