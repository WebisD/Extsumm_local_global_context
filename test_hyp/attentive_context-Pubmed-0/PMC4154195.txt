to our knowledge , few cases of lcnec with egfr gene mutation have been described up to now , and only one case was treated with gefitinib , with a good response   .
during the last years tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) have changed the natural history of metastatic non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) mutations .
we report the case of a patient affected by lcnec carrying all of the predictive characteristics associated with egfr mutation ( caucasian , female , never - smoker ) .
lcnec is a rare tumor which is usually treated with cisplatin - based chemotherapy as sclc   as it shares many characteristics with it . usually , the administration of tkis is considered only for advanced lung adenocarcinoma because the most important studies demonstrating higher activity of tki , in comparison with standard platinum - based chemotherapy , were conducted in patients affected by nsclc with egfr mutations .
a 47-year - old caucasian woman with no family history of neoplastic diseases and no comorbidities was examined by a general practitioner after the appearance of back pain unresponsive to usual non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs .
