to present a unique case of a 58-year - old female with toxic anterior segment syndrome ( tass ) , following a triple procedure : descemet 's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ( dsaek ) , phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation .
the anterior chamber reaction improved gradually , with tapering down of topical and oral treatment , until a complete resolution of the anterior chamber reaction was observed .
the patient was treated with topical dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% and topical atropine sulfate 1% . due to a slow improvement in her clinical status , oral prednisone 1 mg / kg / day was added .
taking into account the estimated volume of dsaek triple procedures performed worldwide , we would expect an annual incidence of several tass cases , following triple dsaek procedures . however , we were unable to find any such previous reports in the literature .
this fact raises questions regarding the cause of reduced tass incidence following triple dsaek procedures .
it is probable that the cataract extraction constituent of the triple dsaek procedure is responsible for the occurrence of tass in our patient .
nevertheless , the fact that there is no previous report of tass following such a procedure raises questions regarding the cause of the reduced incidence of tass following triple dsaek procedures . due to the fact that the inflammatory reaction may jeopardize the integrity of the endothelial graft and reduce the chances of a successful transplant
