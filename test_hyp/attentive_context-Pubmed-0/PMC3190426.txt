the purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy using of fluoroscopy cpf in a standardized clinical protocol for patients with spinal spondylotic myelopathy treated by laminectomies .
many surgical procedures may be performed for cervical spondylotic myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament , and associated with a high incidence of neurologic morbidity , construct failure , and pseudoarthrosis in lateral mass screw placement.  we theorized that laminectomy and stabilization of the cervical spine with cpf would obviate the advantages in osteoporotic cervical spine decompression , prevent the development of kyphotic deformity .
we performed a total of 70 posterior cpfs in 10 cases in a clinical study held in our clinic between 2006 and 2009 .
use of the cpf provides a very strong three - column stabilization but also carries vascular injury without nerve damage .
this technique yielded good fusion rate without complications and can be considered as a good alternative compared to other techniques .
the various posterior fixation techniques , spinous process wiring , triple - wire technique , and sublaminar wiring require use of the lamina as the stabilizing anchor . these techniques allow simultaneous posterior decompression with fixation and stabilization in patients who have undergone previous laminectomy in the cervical spine however , postoperative rigid external support using a halo vest was required for many patients .
