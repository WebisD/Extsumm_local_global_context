in the present study , we were able to isolate the olfactory arteries from mouse brain without causing apparent traumatic damage and measure the vessel reactivity to vasoactive agents , suggesting that mouse olfactory arteries can be used to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cerebrovascular function .
for example , anatomically , intracerebral large subarachnoid arteries [ as middle cerebral artery ( mca ) ] of rodents show a short interbranch distance relative to vessel diameter , which makes it difficult to find a long ( 0.5 - 1 mm ) , branch - free segment feasible for cannulation . in this study , we developed the method for isolation of the olfactory artery from the mouse brain and characterization of vascular reactivity .
in the present study , we recorded the vascular reactivity of isolated mouse olfactory artery ex vivo which constricted in response to various vasoconstrictors , including kcl , pe , et-1 , and a thromboxane agonist ( prostaglandin pgh2 ; u-46619 ) . moreover , this isolated vessel demonstrated vasodilation in a dose - dependent manner when treated with vasodilatory agents including acetylcholine and bradykinin .
tissue - organ bath systems have been widely used in ex vivo studies for cerebrovascular function by measuring the forces in strips or rings of isolated vessel segments9,19,20,23,25 ) , whereas the transcranial window methods have been developed to study the vessel function in vivo in live experimental rodents18 ) , in particular , in leptomeningeal arteries and arterioles ( only to a depth of 250 m from the cortical surface)17,24 ) .
