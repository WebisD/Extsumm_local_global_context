table  2staphylococcus species and pfge types from bangladeshi fingerprints before washing with soap representing elements of the transient ( tm ) microflora and after washing representing resident fingertip microflora ( rm ) staphylococcus species and pfge types from bangladeshi fingerprints before washing with soap representing elements of the transient ( tm ) microflora and after washing representing resident fingertip microflora ( rm ) to conclude , we see only limited geographic differentiation between microbial dna fingerprints from dutch europeans and bangladeshi south asians , indicating that geographic inferences of human hosts from fingertip microbial dna analysis is not feasible .
if a comparable relationship exists between humans and their skin microbiota , as has been observed for h. pylori , new methods for human geographic origin determination could be developed based on dna analysis of fingertip microflora , with interesting new applications to molecular analyses of physical fingerprints left at crime scenes .
furthermore , our results from dna profiling of transient and resident fingertip microflora show that human fingertip microflora is too dynamic and thus does not fulfill the criteria required for forensic marker developments to infer any human host information from physical fingerprints .
