rates of diabetes mellitus are rising dramatically across the globe , threatening both individual health as well as the stability of national health systems . in the united states , diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness , kidney failure , and non - traumatic amputations while also playing a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease , the leading killer of those with the disease . with estimates that diabetes currently affects nearly 24 million people in the us and that this number will rise to over 44 million individuals by 2034 , the staggering $ 245 billion spent annually on diabetes - related healthcare costs is sure to rise dramatically .
our recent work demonstrating that dietary exposure to the phenylsulfamide fungicide tf promotes weight gain , adipose accretion , and glucose intolerance as well as systemic and cellular insulin resistance provides further support to the theory that environmental toxicants likely contribute to the current global epidemic of metabolic disease . while exposure to certain edcs has been shown to be sufficient to initiate the development of diabetes , this occurs rarely .
the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of exciting epidemiological and basic science data suggesting that environmental contaminants play a pathogenic role in the development of metabolic disease ( reviewed in refs . ) . indeed , while initially implicated in perturbations of sex steroid and thyroid hormone signaling , environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) have now been shown to be associated with or to directly alter body weight and glucose homeostasis after either adult or developmental exposure ( reviewed in refs . ) .
