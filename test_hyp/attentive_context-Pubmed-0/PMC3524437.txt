the aim of this study was to characterize the risk factors for development of rickets in elbw infants fed with high mineral containing preterm formula .
the duration of hospitalization and parenteral nutrition were significantly longer in the rickets group versus the control group ( table 1 ) . in univariate analysis , elbw infants with rickets had a significantly higher occurrence of pda ( p = 0.025 ) , pnac ( p = 0.041 ) , severe pnac ( p = 0.013 ) , bpd ( p = 0.019 ) , and moderate / severe bpd ( p = 0.012 ) ( table 2 ) .
common neonatal illnesses such as hmd , air leak , nec , rop , ivh and periventricular leucomalacia ( pvl ) were not different between the groups . in multiple regression analysis after adjustment of gestation and birth weight , rickets in elbw infants significantly correlated with severe pnac ( or 18.5 ; 95% ci , 1.1 - 285 ; p = 0.042 ) and moderate / severe bpd ( or 3.2 ; 95% ci , 1.2 - 26.5 ; p = 0.04 ) ( table 3 ) .
we suggest that in elbw infants with severe pnac or moderate / severe bpd , aggressive prevention or treatment for rickets and fractures can be instituted earlier in the course of management .
