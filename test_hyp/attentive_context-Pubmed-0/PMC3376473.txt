total pe is associated with significant surgical morbidity , a fact that underscores the importance of careful patient selection and counseling . the emergence of minimally invasive surgery and application of this technology to radical pelvic surgery including pe may result in a reduction operative morbidity and mortality .
pe is a radical operation , involving en bloc resection of pelvic organs , including reproductive structures , bladder , and rectosigmoid . in gynecologic oncology , it is most commonly indicated for the treatment of advanced primary or locally recurrent cancer .
as the best chance for disease - free survival is surgical resection of regional disease , this procedure is an opportunity to cure advanced and recurrent cancers confined to the pelvis .
pelvic exenteration ( pe ) describes a radical surgery involving the en bloc resection of the pelvic organs , including the internal reproductive organs , bladder , and rectosigmoid .
patients need to be carefully selected and counseled about risks and long - term issues related to the surgery .
pe has also been used for palliation of symptoms related to radiation necrosis or extensive tumor burden .
advances in laparoscopic and robotic assisted technology applied to pe have improved operative recovery . despite these significant advances and five - year survival rates of approximately 50% , pe remains a radical procedure with significant complications ( 3192% ; see table 1 ) , both physical and psychological .
