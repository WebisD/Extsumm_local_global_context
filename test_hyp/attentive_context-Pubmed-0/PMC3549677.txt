we present a case of a 19-year - old woman with a univentricular heart who suffered a major stroke .
patients with univentricular heart malformations are at increased risk of suffering from thromboembolic events ( te ) . at least 20% of patients with univentricular hearts have reported to experience te , of which 25% are fatal . despite the high incidence of te , no consensus has been reached regarding the role of long - term anti - thrombotic treatment in this group of patients . here ,
spontaneous thrombi in 19-year old patients are , however , extremely rare . hence , seen in the light of a known cardiac malformation , the probability of a cardiac - derived cerebral embolus is very high .
a 19-year - old woman born with a univentricular heart was found unconscious in her bed in the morning .
since no cardiac thrombi were identified , it is not known whether the described stroke was caused by a cardiac - derived embolus or spontaneous cranial thrombi .
the patient suffered mild brain damage and was now described as behaving at the level of a 12-year - old .
the technique has evolved from the classic fontan3 ( right atrium - to - pulmonary artery connection ) through an intracardiac lateral tunnel procedure , and it is currently performed in many centers as an extracardiac tunnel procedure by insertion of a tube graft between the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery.4 te , both systemic venous and arterial , are a major cause of early and late mortality in tcpc patients .
