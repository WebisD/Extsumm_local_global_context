however , the association of acc with scm is considered very rare variant and only two reports of this condition are available .
aplasia cutis congenita ( acc ) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by noninflammatory , well - demarcated defects of all skin layers , subcutaneous tissue , with possible co - defects in muscles , periosteum , bone and dura .
a full - term girl , the first child of a 24-year - old mother was born with large skin , muscle , bone and dural defect in the lumbo - sacral area .
variants of this malformation associated with a split of the spinal column , spinal bony spurs , myeloceles , myelomeningoceles , lipomas and dermal sinuses has been previously reported in the literature .
acc is most often a benign isolated defect , but can be associated with other physical anomalies or malformation syndromes . on the other hand , a split cord malformation ( scm ) , also called a diastematomyelia , is a rare spinal anomaly and refers to a sagittal division of the spinal cord into two symmetrical or asymmetrical hemicords .
recent studies demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and 3d ct are useful for the diagnosis of scm . in this case , however , we approached this variant as an open dysraphism without preoperative mri as the lesion was totally exposed and identifiable .
