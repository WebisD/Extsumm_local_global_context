the purpose of this article was to report a case and describe the use of pet / ct to make a diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation for lch involving thyroid .
to the best of our knowledge , few studies had reported that the positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) was used for diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation for lch involving thyroid in detail .
a 27-year - old man came to our hospital with painless thyroid nodules that had been present for more than 3 months .
when the thyroid nodule fnab results showed the possibility of langerhans cells infiltration , the lch involving thyroid should be considered .
langerhans cell histiocytosis ( lch ) is a rare monoclonal disease , of which incidence rate is 4 to 5 per 1 million individuals , and mortality rate is about 3% in adults .
however , due to the fact that involvement of the thyroid either as an isolated mass or as part of multisystemic disease is extremely rare , the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation for such disease is still controversial . according to preliminary statistics ,
the pet / ct should be kept in mind for lch involving thyroid , which provides evidence to select the most effective and reliable treatment , and contributes to the individualized treatment for lch .
