the primary sources of the studies addressed in this review were full - text articles and abstracts published in english in the pubmed database between 2010 and february 2013 .
the impact of this disease is the limited development of drugs to prevent or treat load , which is mostly attributable to incomplete characterization of the basic underlying pathologic mechanisms . determining which genes and gene networks contribute to load risk would reveal basic pathogenic mechanisms , highlighting key proteins and pathways for drug development (  druggable targets  ) , and inform the development of genetic testing methods for identifying those at greatest risk of load when preventive measures become available . in recent years , the genetic analysis of load has focused on identification of common variants through genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) and has identified several novel susceptibility genes implementing specific pathways in the disease .
this article reviews these studies , discusses their potentials and limitations , and provides suggestions for future research .

gwas have identified several susceptibility genes , and sequencing studies have identified specific causative variants in these genes , but have also provided invaluable evidence for an involvement of rare variants in this complex disease , overturning the common disease
