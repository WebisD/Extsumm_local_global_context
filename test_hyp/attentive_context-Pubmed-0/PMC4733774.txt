patients with lbbb and an abnormal q wave have a high probability of cardiovascular death and need early targeted management for mild systolic dysfunction .
kaplan - meier analysis showed that a higher probability of cardiovascular death was observed in patients with nyha class iii / iv ( p = 0.018 ) , those with severe systolic dysfunction ( lvef  35% ) ( p = 0.045 ) , and those with the presence of left bundle branch block ( lbbb ) ( p = 0.002 ) and an abnormal q wave ( p = 0.001 , figure 2 ) .
p = 0.02 ) , and the presence of lbbb ( hr : 2.36 ; 95% ci : 1.324.22 ; p = 0.004 ) and a q wave ( hr : 2.68 ; 95% ci : 1.425.04 ; p = 0.002 ) . in the multivariate model , after adjusting for confounding factors , nyha class iii / iv at the diagnosis of end - stage hcm ( hr : 1.99 ; 95% ci : 1.053.80 ; p = 0.036 ) , the presence of a q wave ( hr : 2.21 ; 95% ci : 1.164.23 ; p = 0.016 ) , and lbbb ( hr : 2.80 ; 95% ci : 1.475.31 ; p = 0.002 ) were identified as independent predictors of cardiovascular death .
