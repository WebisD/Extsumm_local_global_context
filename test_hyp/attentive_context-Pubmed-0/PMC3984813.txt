therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the adiponectin gene by real - time pcr , to determine the concentrations of adiponectin protein in the porcine ovary ( corpora lutea , granulosa and theca interna cells ) and to compare gene and protein expression levels during different stages of the oestrous cycle in pigs . additionally , we sought to determine the in vitro effect of adiponectin on the secretion of steroid hormones ( progesterone , oestradiol , testosterone , and androstenedione ) by ovarian luteal , granulosa , and theca interna cells of sexually mature swine .
the presence of adiponectin mrna and protein in porcine ovaries observed in this study as well as the presence of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 in the gonads noted in our previous work could provide evidence for auto / paracrine actions of the analysed hormone .
the variations in adiponectin gene and protein expression during the oestrous cycle indicate that adiponectin expression is determined by the hormonal status of pigs .
the above authors observed higher levels of cyclooxygenase-2 , prostaglandin e synthase , and vegf gene expression in cells primed with adiponectin , an increase in the expression of the star gene and a decrease in the expression of the p450 aromatase gene .
