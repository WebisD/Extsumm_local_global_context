we used molecular community fingerprinting ( automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis ) of more than 100 samples as well as next generation amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene to assess bacterial and archaeal community composition .
we accompanied the molecular analyses with a comprehensive characterization of environmental conditions , including bottom and pore water chemistry , sediment permeability as well as carbon and nitrogen content . through these analyses we further identified microbial taxa that may constitute  losers and 
thus , for future research on the impact of oa on sediment microbial communities , we strongly recommend performing a detailed assessment of the environmental conditions in the sediment and of other parameters than those of the carbonate system .
we conclude that naturally co2-rich sites such as the co2 seeps in png may continue to be used for oa research on sediment microbial communities under the premise that the environmental conditions in the sediment are well documented .
this will enable a more reliable selection of naturally co2-rich sites as analogues for oa scenarios and will also improve the comparability between studies from different naturally co2-rich sites .
the detailed characterization of the sediment based on 29 different environmental parameters showed that carbonate chemistry alone , specifically the ph gradient , was insufficient to describe the environmental conditions at these sites . whereas some of the observed environmental parameters , e.g. sediment permeability , grain size , and nitrogen , organic and inorganic carbon content , supported the classification of sites along the ph gradient , mainly pore water element concentrations varied among sampling sites with comparable ph .
