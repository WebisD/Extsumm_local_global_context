twenty - eight post mortem lower eyelids ( 14 right , 14 left ) from 16 japanese cadavers were examined and divided into 2 groups .
although all the cadavers were in an eye - closed state , and the muscle tonus of the orbicularis oculi had been completely lost , this state would have been similar to the eye - opening state in live humans whose muscle tonus of the orbicularis oculi is little . as the lacrimal probing syringing and trephining
the course of the laterally directed vertical portion of the lacrimal canaliculus should be considered not only in lacrimal probing , syringing , and trephining but also in eyelid surgeries .
most vertical portions of the lower lacrimal canaliculus examined here demonstrated a laterally inclined course of approximately 5 degrees ( figure 4 ) .
in the first group , which underwent a strict sagittal incision , 10 canaliculi of 7 cadavers ( 6 right , 4 left ; male 5 eyelids , female 5 eyelids ) were interrupted at the halfway point of the vertical portion and so the distal part of the canaliculi were not included ( figures 2a , b ) .
the 5 degrees lateral inclination of the vertical portion significantly emphasizes the need of a laterally directed insertion and lateral lid traction during the passage of a lacrimal probe , syringing needle or trephine to accord with the true course of the vertical portion . as well , since the vertical portion takes its lateral course within 1 mm laterally from the lacrimal punctum ( whitnall 1979 ; hwang et al 2005 ) , surgeons , during eyelid surgery , need to recognize the area within 1 mm laterally from the punctum as being a zone with a potential for serious lacrimal canalicular injury .
