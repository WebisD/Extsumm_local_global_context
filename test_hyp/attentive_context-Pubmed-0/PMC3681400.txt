a 51-year - old pakistani man presented to the emergency department with a painfully swollen right lower limb .
cvvh at a dose of 35 ml / kg / h and using a highly adsorptive membrane might be an excellent tool for rapid and adequate elimination of colistin , avoiding any rebound effect .
therefore , it is of utmost importance that clinicians remain aware of this rare but life - threatening complication when prescribing colistin .
, adsorption is the main mechanism of removal of colistin and might be responsible for 80% of the whole removal . in conclusion , a case of colistin - associated neuromuscular blockade presenting as sudden severe respiratory muscle weakness and apnea is described .
his medical history revealed insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and a recent hospitalization in pakistan with a crush trauma of the right foot .
this finding may offer important perspectives with regard to urgent treatment of life - threatening colistin toxicity in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients . according to the reports of li et al14 and our findings
of note , no clinically significant neurotoxicity was observed during colistin treatment in a large group of patients with underlying neurological disorders admitted to a neurosurgical icu.6 except for one ( not so well documented ) case of diffuse muscular weakness in an icu patient that spontaneously resolved 1 month after discharge , neuromuscular toxicity has never been described in prospective studies evaluating colistin treatment.2 diagnosis of neurotoxicity is mostly made on clinical grounds , making it difficult to discriminate eventual colistin - induced neurotoxicity from the more frequently observed  critical illness polymyoneuropathy  in icu patients . in only one study ,
