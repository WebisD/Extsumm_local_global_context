pulmonary embolism is a relatively rare cause of cardiac syncope , which may explain why it is frequently ignored.1 the variability of presentation sets the patient and clinician up for potentially missing the diagnosis .
forty percent of these patients had been seen by a physician in the weeks prior to their death.2 when syncope is the presenting symptom of pulmonary embolism , it should raise the clinical suspicion for a massive clot burden or saddle embolism requiring prompt treatment .
a 52-year - old man was referred to our hospital because of two episodes of syncope within a fortnight .
the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is amongst the most challenging problems encountered in clinical practice . despite the awareness amongst physicians of the risks associated with a delay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ,
an experimental catheter embolectomy used in cardiac catheterization appears promising.11 ivc filters are an appropriate option for patients with high bleeding risks . the insertion rate of ivc filters has increased in recent years ; this increase , however , has occurred without proven improved safety and efficiency.12 another important point in the management of this patient was the optimal duration of anticoagulation . despite the fact that the patient had a weak family history of hypercoagulable states , a proper course of action required his management as a case of idiopathic venous thromboemboli and with an indefinite duration of oral anticoagulant ( warfarin ) therapy.13
