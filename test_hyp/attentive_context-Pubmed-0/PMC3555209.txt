studies involving bone biomarkers in gd show variable results which do not currently support their routine use for the clinical assessment of bone status , as an indication for therapy initiation , or for monitoring the response to therapy . a greater understanding of bone markers and their relation to the bone manifestations of gd is required .
gaucher disease ( gd ) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism , characterized by the accumulation of glucosylceramide in cells of the reticulo - endothelial system , due to deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme , beta - glucosidase ( glucocerebrosidase , ec 3.2.1.45 ) .
the identification of a sensitive biomarker specific for bone disease in gd would , therefore , be of significant benefit for detecting and monitoring bone involvement , and would help clinicians determine optimal timing of treatment for the prevention of bone complications .
studies in gd patients that measure biomarker response after the initiation of bisphosphonate therapies showed a decrease in bone biomarkers . a reduction in osteocalcin and hydroxyproline , and osteocalcin , bsap and ntx , together with statistically significant increases in bmd suggest that bone markers may be responsive to bisphosphonate intervention in gd , and that the use of biomarkers may be relevant to the study of bisphosphonate treatment response .
