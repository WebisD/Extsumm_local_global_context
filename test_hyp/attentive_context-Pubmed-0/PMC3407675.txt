the personalized approaches in advanced cancer therapy and the evolution of molecularly targeted will streamline chemoprevention research and facilitate the development of rational , effective , and safe preventive drugs , involving different pathways and with the ability to modify carcinogenesis in early phases .
in conclusion , the success of chemopreventive approach depends on a tumor - specific risk model for identifying high - risk subjects , increasing preclinical drug test over the development novel and more safety chemopreventative agents , and identifying new surrogate endpoint using molecular pathways and new targets of drugs activity .
despite the success of action showed for example in endocrine intervention is a promising starting point in order to continue to evolve with the rapid integration of molecular approaches into research and clinical practice .
  while decreases in both breast cancer incidence and mortality have been apparent in recent years , the societal and economic impact of this malignancy continues to be enormous .
thus , the current thinking is that prevention is a highly feasible approach to breast cancer control . despite several factors which increase the woman ' risk ( gender , age , and family history ) are not changeable , other modified risk factors such as alcohol intake , dietary fat , obesity in postmenopausal age , and hormonal stimulations have been identified and for these reasons interest in strategies to prevent breast cancer remains strong and intriguing .
