the patients in the experimental group ( eg , 
 n = 15 ) and control group ( cg , n = 15 ) performed task 
 practice with and without 3ns kinesiology taping , respectively .
a previous study evaluating the effects of kinesiology taping indicates that applying tape 
 to the affected upper limbs of post - stroke patients reduces spasms , resulting in improved 
 range of motion , strength , and function9 . 

therefore , this study determined the effects of kinesiology taping on 
 upper - extremity function and activities of daily living ( adl ) in patients with hemiplegia . 

this study was conducted from june 4 to december 22 , 2012 on 30 post - stroke patients who 
 were hospitalized in a rehabilitation hospital in chungcheong province , south korea .
there was no significant change in the 
 brunnstrom recovery stage of the hand after the intervention in either group , but the meanof 
 post - intervention score tended to be higher in the eg . however , post - intervention , the fim 
 changed significantly within each group and differed significantly between groups ( table 1table 1.changes in upper - limb function and activities of daily living ( n
