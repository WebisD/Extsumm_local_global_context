the purpose of this review is to discuss the application of animal models for the study of the three main food allergens : cow 's milk , hen 's egg , and peanuts / tree nuts and to provide an overview of the contribution of animal models to our understanding of these allergens and food allergy in general .
this has stimulated great interest in the use of relevant animal models to predict possible triggers for allergy , identify possible mechanisms involved in setting up the allergic pathway , as well as the testing of novel therapeutic treatments   .
despite our improved understanding of food allergy in recent years , there is still no specific therapeutic option available . currently , strict avoidance and the use of adrenaline in the event of an accidental exposure are the only approved treatments , although several forms of immunotherapy are presently under investigation including oral ( oit ) , sublingual ( slit ) , epicutaneous ( epit ) , and subcutaneous allergen - specific immunotherapy ( scit )   .
research in humans is limited by ethical concerns and the chance of fatal anaphylactic reactions .
this escalation in the prevalence of food allergies underlies the importance of further research to improve prevention and treatment strategies .
