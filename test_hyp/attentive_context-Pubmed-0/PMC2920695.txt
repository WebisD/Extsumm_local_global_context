attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) is a behavioral disorder usually diagnosed during childhood .
the behavioral difficulties of patients with adhd inattentive type may be markedly different from those of children with combined or hyperactive / impulsive type and the targets of treatment will need to be tailored accordingly . while behavioral interventions targeting organization , planning and time - management can not be classified as 
the interventions evaluated to date have varied in where the intervention is delivered ( e.g. school , home , or clinic ) , and dissemination models will need to account for these factors . providing intervention directly in the setting where the skills are most relevant / problematic ( e.g. school ) should allow clinicians to achieve higher levels of skills generalization . to promote dissemination , intervention protocols should be developed that do not require a high degree of clinical specialization to implement and that can be implemented directly in the setting of interest .
a central challenge will be figuring out how to disseminate these interventions into clinical practice .
diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - iv ) diagnostic criteria define three adhd subtypes based on the presence of inattention and hyperactivity / impulsivity symptoms : predominantly inattentive type , predominantly hyperactive / impulsive type , and combined type . a recent us national epidemiological study of 8- to 15-year - old school children found an 8.7% prevalence of adhd , with the predominantly inattentive type most prevalent ( 4.4% ) among the adhd subtypes ( combined type , 2.2% ; predominantly hyperactive - impulsive type , 2.0% ) .
