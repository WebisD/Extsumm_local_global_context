third , the levels of knee 
 pain were different among individual patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis , and the 
 effects of medication and previous treatment could not be eliminated . to further determine 
 the frp of the erector spinae in elderly females with chronic knee osteoarthritis , further 
 studies that account for the limitations of the present study may be required .
in the present study , the frp of the erector spinae in elderly females with chronic knee 
 osteoarthritis and healthy young females were measured to determine whether the erector 
 spinae flexion - relaxation rates could act as a useful pain evaluation tool for patients with 
 knee osteoarthritis . although no significant differences were evident in the 
 flexion - relaxation rates of the left and right thoracic erector spinae or right lumbar 
 erector spinae , significant differences were shown in the flexion - relaxation rates of the 
 left thoracic erector spinae .
first , the study sample was small and was limited to females 
 with chronic knee osteoarthritis
there are currently insufficient studies examining the effects of osteoarthritis on the frp 
 of the erector spinae and on how the frp of the erector spinae observed in young adults is 
 different from that of the elderly in whom osteoarthritis has occurred . therefore , the 
 present study compared the frps of the erector spinae occurring during ( 1 ) trunk flexion , 
 ( 2 ) complete trunk flexion , and ( 3 ) trunk extension motions in both healthy , young females 
 and elderly females with chronic knee osteoarthritis . in addition , data regarding whether 
 the frp of the erector spinae can be used as a method of evaluating the degree of pain in 
 chronic osteoarthritis in the elderly will be presented .
