the full study has recently been published   and these datasets may serve as a platform to understand the toxic mechanisms and ecological hazard of environmental radionuclides such as du in fish .
to study the short - term effects of waterborne depleted uranium ( du ) , atlantic salmon parr ( n  =  6 ) were exposed for 48  h to 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 1.0  mg / l uranyl acetate ( uo2(ch3coo)22h2o , purity    98.0% , specific activity 1.459    10  bq / g , fluka , sigma - aldrich , buchs , switzerland ) dissolved in lake water collected from lake maridalsvannet , oslo , norway .
this article describes high quality transcriptomic datasets generated from an ecotoxicological study on the early stress responses in atlantic salmon after short - term ( 48  h ) exposure to waterborne depleted uranium ( du ) using a custom microarray for salmonid fish .
after raw data processing , in total 40,267 features were log-2 transformed and used for downstream statistical analysis to determine differentially expressed gene transcripts ( degs ) .
