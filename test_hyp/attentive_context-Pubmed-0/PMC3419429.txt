the data showed that both asgr1 and asgr2 are expressed in human monocytes in the circulation , that expression can not be detected in lymphocytes and granulocytes , that the transcripts of both genes differ between individuals and that , in a given individual , the transcription profile for asgr2 is restricted to one of two patterns .
in this study , expression of asgr1 and asgr2 was demonstrated in peripheral blood monocytes . for both genes ,
the present study investigated the expression of asgr1 and asgr2 in human peripheral blood monocytes .
is expressed in rat peritoneal macrophages , it was considered possible that monocytes , the lineage precursor of tissue macrophages , may also express the receptor . to the best of our knowledge ,
monocytes play a pivotal role in inflammation and immunity , the finding of asgpr transcripts within these cells offers new insight into their biochemistry and functional potential .
the findings of the present study do not suggest expression of alternative asgpr - related genes in monocytes , rather they are entirely consistent with transcription of asgr1 and asgr2 , as occurs in the liver .
the data were interpreted to indicate that the rodent macrophage asialoglycoprotein - binding protein and the liver asgpr were encoded by related genes ; however , it now seems possible that alternative splicing may underlie the differences .
