the prevalence of smoking and the levels of tg , lipoprotein(a ) , fpg , creatinine , hs - crp , and ctni were significantly higher in patients with cad compared to patients with nca group ( all p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , ifn- , il-4 , il-17 , tgf-1 , high - sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) , and the classical atherosclerosis risk factors were evaluated .
the use of aspirin , -blockers , and statins was rare in patients with acs ( all p < 0.05 ) , whereas the levels of lipoprotein(a ) and hs - crp were markedly higher in patients with acs ( all p < 0.01 ) .
in the present study , we found that participants with cad had lower serum gal-9 levels compared with nca . furthermore , serum gal-9 levels in the acs group were significantly lower than those in the sap or nca group .
compared with stemi group , patients in sap and nsteacs groups showed markedly higher hdl - c levels and age and lower levels of lipoprotein(a ) , fpg , hs - crp , and ctni ( all p < 0.01 ) . compared to patients with sap ,
