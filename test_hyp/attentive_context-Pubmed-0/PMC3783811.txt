the following case presentation deals with wt of the left parotid gland and highlights its clinicopathologic concepts along with its therapeutic management .
this is a curious benign neoplasm with its intimidating histological name , papillary cyst adenoma lymphomatosum .
earlier in the literature this was also referred to as adeno - lymphoma , papillary cyst adenoma , cystadeno - lymphoma , and epitheliolymphoid cyst .
a 65-year - old male patient visited the department of oral medicine , with the chief complaint of swelling below the left ear lobe since six years .
benign neoplasms of the salivary glands are frequently encountered in dental practice . these account for 3% of the tumors involving the head and neck .
histopathologically , it has a cystic appearance with a double layer of oncocytes surrounding a lymphoid stroma .
the most accepted hypothesis about the origin of wt is that it develops from salivary duct inclusions in the lymph nodes , after the embryonic development of the parotid gland .
another complication of lesser importance is the change of facial contour due to resection of a large portion of the parotid gland .
since wt can be multifocal , a preoperative diagnosis by means of fine needle aspiration biopsy is mandatory and complete bilateral screening of the gland by mri is needed to program surgery .
