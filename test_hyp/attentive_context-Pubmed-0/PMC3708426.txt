because the prevalence of ehpvo is the highest in developing countries and the condition affects mainly the poor   , most of whom do not have access to blood transfusion facilities and are not treatment compliant , the benefits of using a less invasive procedure like endoscopic therapy must be weighed against surgery which , in the best centres carries an operative mortality of 1% , is a onetime treatment , is not associated with encephalopathy and followed by rebleeding rates of less than 10% .
extrahepatic portal venous obstruction ( ehpvo ) is accompanied by replacement of the extrahepatic portal vein by a cavernoma with or without thrombosis of the intrahepatic portal , splenic , or superior mesenteric veins . in developing countries ,
the main disadvantages of endotherapy are that it requires multiple sessions and a long - term followup with a recurrence rate of up to 40% in some studies .
. however mortality rates of between 5 and 30% have been reported for a single bleeding episode because of the large volumes of blood lost in patients who do not have access to sophisticated medical facilities including blood transfusion . till the middle of the 20th century , surgery was the only treatment available for these patients . however , with the advent of endoscopic therapy , this soon became the predominant treatment modality for the control of acute bleeding and also an important method for the prevention of a repeated bleeding episode .
