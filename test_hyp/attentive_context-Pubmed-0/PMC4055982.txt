septic shock is consistently the most common causative factor identified for acute kidney injury ( aki ) in critical illness , and has been associated with nearly 50% of cases internationally . despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of septic aki ,
prospective data are required to evaluate the true contribution of raised venous pressure to renal and other organ dysfunction and to determine better endpoints for fluid resuscitation in sepsis .
treatment aimed at reversing or preventing septic aki remains primarily based on supportive haemodynamic management . in the previous issue of critical care , legrand and colleagues examine the association between haemodynamic targets of resuscitation ( cardiac output , mean or diastolic blood pressure , central venous pressure ( cvp ) and central venous oxygen saturation ) and development or persistence of aki in a single centre study of patients with septic shock admitted to a surgical icu .
it is now important to determine whether uncritical pursuit of cvp targets such as those advocated by the surviving sepsis campaign might , in some patients , add insult to sepsis - induced organ injury .
the association between elevated cvp and renal dysfunction has been made previously in the setting of chronic cardiac failure .
