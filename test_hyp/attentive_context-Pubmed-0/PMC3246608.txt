we have also synthesized nanorods of molybdenum oxide and mixed oxides of molybdenum and vanadium using similar strategy .
in summary , we demonstrate a thermal decomposition method for the synthesis of 1-d wo3nanorods in high yield using a single source precursor . one of the important aspects of this method is the in situ formation of nanostructures due to the surfactant encapsulated metal oxide clusters . the advantage of this method is the tunability of the metal precursor and the surfactant group .
this aspect of the method can be exploited for the synthesis of several other transition metal oxide nanorods .
the as synthesized wo3nanorods perform well as an electrocatalyst with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for her when compared to its bulk counterpart .
the results show the possibility of minimizing the loading of noble metal electrocatalyst for her by using wo3nanorods as catalyst support .
the as - synthesized tungsten trioxide nanorods have been employed as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction ( her ) .
