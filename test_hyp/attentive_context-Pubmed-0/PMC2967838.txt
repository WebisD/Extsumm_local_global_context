the jsis features provide rich information for lesion segmentation . both by visual inspection on different types of lesions ( lung nodules and colonic polyps ) , as well as using a quantitative evaluation on 101 solid nodules and 80 ggo nodules , demonstrate the potential of the proposed method .
a second original contribution is our energy function , which incorporates the image intensity and the shape feature into a markov random field ( mrf ) minimized with graph cuts . in particular , the intensity and shape information appear in both our unary and pairwise terms . compared to our previous work in , we have improved our unary term in the energy function by considering both image intensity and shape features and investigated the method on a relatively large dataset that contains different types of nodules , including juxtavascular , juxtapleural , as well as ggo . moreover ,
the method can not only successfully segment lesions adjacent to structures of similar intensity but different shape , but also can correctly identify some part of lesions with different intensity ( due to pve in ct imaging ) but similar shape .
the experimental results , evaluated both visually and quantitatively , demonstrate high performance for ct lung nodule segmentation .
