therefore , we compared the frequency distribution of malnutrition between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients and its relationship with echocardiographic findings .
, there was no significant relationship between mis and echocardiographic findings ( p > 0.05 ) , except for aortic and mitral valve insufficiencies ( p < 0.05 ) . table 2 indicates that there was no significant relationship between mis and echocardiographic findings in pd patients ( p > 0.05 ) .
the frequency distribution of the malnutrition - inflammation score index there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the frequency distribution of malnutrition indicators ( mis ) ( p > 0.05 ) .
the relationship between malnutrition - inflammation score and echocardiographic findings in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups
this case  control study was done in a dialysis center , both hd and continuous ambulatory pd , in 20112012 in isfahan university of medical sciences , iran .
malnutrition - inflammation score ( mis ) index was used for the evaluation of malnutrition .
successful management of mis may ameliorate the cardiovascular epidemic and poor outcome in dialysis patients . in the comparison between the frequency distribution of mis in the participants of pd and hd groups , despite the 1.8% participants with severe malnutrition in the hd group , no statistically significant differences was observed .
