a 48-year - old woman , asymptomatic , with no medical history of interest , presented in a mammography made as part of a breast cancer screening programme a lesion in the left upper - breast .
our case report is a malignant eccrine spiradenoma ( mes / spiradenocarcinoma ) diagnosed in an asymptomatic woman on the basis of breast cancer prevention programme . because of its rare incidence and lack of imaging workups
only a few cases have been reported , being described for the first time by kersting and helming . though the majority of eccrine spiradenomas involve the head , trunk , and extremities , they can also appear all throughout the skin , mostly as painless solitary nodules .
our aim is therefore to discuss the main characteristics of it , and to review the literature available on this issue .
the sentinel lymph node retrieved from axillary dissection was submitted for intraoperative histological examination obtaining a negative result for metastatic carcinoma .
after 32 months of follow - up , there is no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease .
however , the development of neoplasms with eccrine sweat gland phenotype in the mammary ducts is not surprising in as much as the breast is considered a modified sweat gland . since the original report , 102 cases of mes   have been documented in the literature . of these , only six are described affecting the breast .
