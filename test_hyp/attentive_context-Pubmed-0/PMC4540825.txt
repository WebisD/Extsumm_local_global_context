the study subjects were 230 patients who underwent mammography and biochemical marker tests 
 between march 1 and october 1 , 2014 , at soonchunhyang university hospital .
a limitation of this study was that , because there were a 
 small number of subjects , it was difficult to identify correlations between breast density 
 and biochemical markers objectively . thus , an effort is needed to make more precise risk 
 evaluations of breast density by conducting a large - scale prospective study of korean 
 women .
items exhibiting significant correlations with breast density were : age , 
 0.55 ; height , 0.26 ; weight , 0.30 ; bmi , 0.48 ; hematocrit , 0.15 ; mch , 0.19 ; rdw , 0.15 ; 
 glucose , 0.15 ; ast(got ) , 0.22 ; alt(gpt ) , 0.27 ; alp , 0.28 ; uric acid , 0.16 ; gt(ggt ) , 
 0.18 ; triglyceride , 0.30 ; total cholesterol , 0.16 ; hdl - cholesterol , 0.23 ; and 
 ldl - cholesterol , 0.29 ( p < 0.05 ) . the results of multiple regression analysis using 
 breast density - related variables are shown in table
