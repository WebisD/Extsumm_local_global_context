to summarize , sxrd data 
 have been acquired from -cr2o3(0001 ) 
 as a function of h2o partial 
 pressure . in uhv , after exposure to 2000 l of h2o , the surface is terminated by a partially occupied double layer 
 of chromium atoms ; the lack of adsorbed oh / h2o is concluded 
 to be most likely a result of either adsorption only at defects , or 
 x - ray induced desorption .
this surface geometry is largely consistent 
 with those determined in recent leed - iv and sxrd studies of clean -cr2o3(0001 ) in uhv , although there are differences 
 in the values of atomic coordinates and fractional layer occupancies . 
 at  30 mbar of h2o
, which predict that surface termination evolves 
 as a function of h2o partial pressure at around room temperature 
 as cr  o3cr  ( oh)2cr  o3  ( h2o(oh)2)cr  o3. one possible explanation 
 for this discrepancy between theory and experiment is that the calculations 
 do not explicitly take into account multiple layers of interfacial 
 h2o , which is the expected sxrd measurement environment , 
 as the relative humidity is 100% .
this work builds 
 on a previous sxrd study examining the impact of o2 on 
 the surface structure of -cr2o3(0001 ) .
