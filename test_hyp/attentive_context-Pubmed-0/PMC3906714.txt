the most notable finding in this study is the detection of bioluminescent activity among zooplankton during the polar night , which may be an important ecological feature . while the ultimate and proximate explanations for both the bioluminescence and the dvm behavior detected during the campaign fall outside the data collected during this study , these results provide evidence for both endogenous and exogenous control of poorly understood or previously unknown processes
the goal of the current study was to characterize plankton abundance and distribution patterns during a time of year that has rarely been studied by means of vertical net tows and autonomous underwater vehicle ( auv ) surveys .
fitted on the auv were adcps , a ctd and a bathyphotometer designed to register bioluminescence potential in the water column .
in contrast , this study quantified the bioluminescent community during the polar night and demonstrated the absence of circadian rhythm in bioluminescence .
. also , during this expedition , which took place during the darkest period of the polar night , we observed five different species of seabirds actively foraging at sea ; little auk ( alle alle ) , black - legged kittiwake ( rissa tridactyla ) , northern fulmar ( fulmarus glacialis ) , black guillemot ( cepphus grylle ) and brnnich s guillemot ( uria lomvia ) .
