we report a case with ruptured cerebral aneurysm arising from pcoma , which originated from the internal carotid artery ( ica ) distal to the origin of achoa .
a 40-year - old woman presented with sudden onset of headache . computed tomography ( ct ) revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) which was slightly predominant in the left basal and sylvian cisterns .
it is notable that careful review of the preoperative angiograms helps to find unexpected vascular anomalies which may impose an additional surgical risk .
although several detailed reports about anatomical variations of achoa have been reported , transposition of achoa as to posterior communicating artery ( pcoma ) origin was demonstrated only in 3 reports2 - 4 ) .
cerebral angiography demonstrated a small aneurysm arising from left fetal type of pcoma with suspicion of rupture and the other small aneurysm originating from right pcoma or perforating branch of ica . in this study , left achoa originated from ica proximal to the origin of fetal type of pcoma ( fig .
therefore , complete knowledge about vascular anatomy of achoa is very important before surgical or endovascular manipulations .
the anterior choroidal artery ( achoa ) supplies several important structures including the optic tract , geniculate body , posterior limb of internal capsule , globus pallidus , cerebral peduncle , uncus , amygdala , ventrolateral nucleus of thalamus , and choroid plexus .
