the single campylobacter isolate from a later , non  outbreak - associated batch of duck liver clustered with isolates from wild waterfowl rather than the outbreak isolates or other isolates from farmed ducks . the limited data on campylobacter populations in poultry other than chickens restrict our ability to interpret this discrepancy .
the attack rate of 86% among persons who ate duck liver pt was similar to rates for outbreaks associated with chicken liver pt ( 5,6 ) .
the high level of internal and external contamination in chicken liver in these studies and failure of insufficient cooking to destroy the bacteria in the current outbreak suggest that internal contamination of duck liver also occurs .
, the diversity in the outbreak in this study could reflect individual livers co - infected with > 1 campylobacter strain , > 1 infected liver in the food item , or both .
the clustering of c. jejuni isolates from this outbreak with sts associated with farmed duck and farmed chicken and the genetic separation from wild duck and wild goose isolates ( figure 2 ) suggests that the farm environment may favor some campylobacter spp .
this diversity suggests that bacterial invasion of chicken and duck livers is possible for a wide range of fairly distantly related campylobacter spp .
