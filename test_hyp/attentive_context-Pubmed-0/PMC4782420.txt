the addition of 0.1 mg / kg dexamethasone to caudal ropivacaine for paediatric herniotomies as a single shot injection resulted in a significantly longer duration of analgesia as compared to the use of ropivacaine alone , and the quality of analgesia was better after the first 2 post - operative hours , without any side effects .
the mean duration of analgesia in group b was significantly more than in group a , i.e. , 478.046  104.57 min and 248.4  54.1 p < 0.001 respectively . when pain score was compared within two groups ,
this prospective double - blind study was designed to investigate whether dexamethasone as an adjuvant to 0.2% ropivacaine enhances the analgesic potency in paediatric herniotomies performed under caudal block , .
our study demonstrated a significant prolongation in the post - operative analgesia by adding dexamethasone to caudal ropivacaine .
there was a decrease in pain score and demand for rescue analgesic requirement during 24 h post - operative period and time for first analgesic administration was significantly longer with dexamethasone .
group  b received a bolus of 1 ml / kg of 0.2% ropivacaine with dexamethasone 0.1 mg / kg in saline to make a total volume 1 ml . on receiving the patient in the operation theatre , monitoring was attached in the form of electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , pulse oximetric oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) , non - invasive blood pressure ( nibp ) and parameters recorded .
