parosteal lipoma is an extremely rare benign tumor composed mainly of mature adipose tissue with a bony component .
thought to arise from mesenchymal cells in the periosteum , parosteal lipomas share histopathologic features with the commonly occurring soft - tissue lipomas , and cytogenetic evidence suggests a common histopathogenesis . depending on the degree of chondroid modulation and enchondral ossification , parosteal lipomas may rest directly on the cortex without cartilage or bone elements ; may have a narrow bony stalk with a lucent lipomatous cap , mimicking a pedunculated exostosis ; may have a densely ossified broad - based osteochondromatous element beneath a thin lipomatous cap , simulating a sessile exostosis ; or may have patches of chondroid and bone scattered throughout the lipomatous mass .
malignant transformation of a lipoma should be suspected when rapid bone destruction is seen in a radiolucent lipoma .
