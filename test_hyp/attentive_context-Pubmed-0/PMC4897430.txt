the effects of ion slip on unsteady mhd flow of an incompressible electrically conducting viscoelastic fluid past an impulsively started vertical plate embedded in a porous medium with chemical reaction in presence of heat and mass transfer are studied in this paper .
some of the important conclusions of this paper are as follows.the flow field is significantly affected with the variation of viscoelastic parameter.the effect of ion slip parameter on velocity is prominent throughout the boundary layer in presence of other flow parameters.the rates of heat transfer , that is , nusselt number , and rate of mass transfer , that is , sherwood number , are not significantly affected during the variations of viscoelastic parameter throughout the fluid flow phenomenon.the axial and transverse components of shearing stress are prominently affected by the viscoelastic parameter along with other flow parameters .
the axial and transverse components of shearing stress are prominently affected by the viscoelastic parameter along with other flow parameters .
furthermore , attia   has investigated the effects of heat and mass transfer in elasticoviscous fluid past an impulsively started infinite vertical plate by considering ion slip . in the present study , we propose to investigate the effects of simultaneous heat and mass transfer on the free convection mhd flow of an incompressible electrically conducting viscoelastic fluid characterized by walters liquid ( model b ) past an impulsively started infinite vertical plate embedded in a porous medium considering hall and ion slip effect into account with chemical reaction .
