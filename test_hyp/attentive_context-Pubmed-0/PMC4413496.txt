the above picture helps us to compare the three modalities of lipoaspiration and also helps us to note the advantage of our technique
hence , we recommend our technique as a reliable and routine method for extracting sterile emulsified fat in an economical way .
restoration of structure and function using autologous free fat grafts has always been a challenge .
( figure 1 ) we have devised a novel method of lipoaspiration to overcome these problems .
when the liposuction aspiration using a liposuction pump is performed the whole suction system , and the container needs to be kept sterile .
materials required 20 - 50 cc disposable syringe , a piece of 2  2 cm polypropylene mesh , lipoaspiration suction pump ( figure 2a ) . ( a ) materials required for the procedure , ( b ) connected syringe mesh system , ( c ) close - up view of the mesh in liposuction aspiration , a suction pump is used . in our technique , a piece of polypropylene mesh is kept at one end of the lipoaspiration syringe , which is then connected to the suction pump .
the advent and refinement of liposuction and lipoinjection techniques , abundant donor - tissue availability , and relative ease of harvesting have made autologous fat an attractive material for use as soft - tissue filler .
