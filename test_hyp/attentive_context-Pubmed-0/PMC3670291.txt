initially uncovered by experiments aimed at understanding ifn and ifn- induced transcriptional activation , a new pathway of signal transduction from the cell surface to genes in the nucleus has been recognized in last decades of 19th century . the pathway is called the jak - stat pathway . similar to other pathways , association of ligands to their receptors leads to activation of one of the jak family of tyrosine kinases associated with a trans - membrane receptor , and subsequently leads to the phosphorylation on tyrosine of one or more of a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors called stats .
the details of early experiments in hematopoietic and other systems with the ifns and cytokines have been summarized in many decent reviews ; however , its cardiovascular responses are still limited in literature . in current review , we will mainly discuss the critical role of stat pathway in cardiovascular diseases .
another area of research that should make a significant stride in the next few years is to generate safer agonists and carrier molecules that can be given to patients with an end - stage disease condition to improve heart function .
stat signaling is an important mechanism in the protection of cardiac cells from different stress . to understand the mechanisms and inhibit the transition of adaptive hypertrophy to maladaptive hypertrophy , stat
