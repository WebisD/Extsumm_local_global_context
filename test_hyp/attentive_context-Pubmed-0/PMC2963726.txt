the authors report the use of foreskin as skin graft to repair a loss of substance due to excision   of an interdigital nevus of the foot .
the foreskin is a good autologous full - thickness skin graft in several conditions .  
a four - year - old boy presented a 2  cm  1.5  cm congenital compound nevus entirely covering the plantar surface of the second finger of his left foot ( figure 1 ) .
paediatric dermatologist 's indication was a radical excision because of the site and the dimension of this melanocytic lesion .
furthermore , the site of lesion could indicate surgical excision to prevent continuous microtraumas   .
congenital melanocytic nevus is a frequent condition in childhood ( 0,21% )   .
primary closure of the skin defect secondary to radical excision of the lesion was not indicated because of the large loss of substance and the risk of retractive scar .
surgical excision could determine loss of substance due to the dimension of the nevus that could not be easily directly repaired .
hyperpigmentation was not a contraindication for the use of foreskin as skin graft because the lesion was hidden localizated .  
then we performed circumcision and a radical excision of the nevus ( figure 3(a ) ) ; foreskin , trimmed in a rectangular shape ( figure 2 ) , was sutured into the residual defect ( figure 3(b ) ) .
