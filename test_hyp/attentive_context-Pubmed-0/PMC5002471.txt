our aim was to investigate whether the absolute value of pct measured in critically ill patients on the day when infection was suspected , or the change in pct ( delta - pct ) from the day before to the day when infection was suspected , was a better indicator of infection .
the main finding of this observational study was an increase in pct levels from the day before ( t1 ) to the day when infection was suspected ( t0 ) predicted infection , while in patients with no proven infection pct remained unchanged .
the clinical implication of these results is that daily pct measurements in patients at high risk of infection allow the opportunity to evaluate pct kinetics , which may improve diagnostic accuracy and rationalise antibiotic therapy on the icu and improve outcome .
both absolute values and kinetics of c - reactive protein are poor indicators of infection ; furthermore , conventional indicators of infection such as white cell count and body temperature have limited use for predicting infection in the icu .
