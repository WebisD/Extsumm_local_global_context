, we proposed a randomized , two - armed , open - label study to analyze the efficacy and safety of optimized axillary vein puncture versus conventional subclavian puncture in cied implantation .
second , it was a single - centered trial and all the procedures were performed by one operator , thus interpretation and extrapolation of the results should be cautious . a multi - centered trial with larger scale and longer follow - ups is necessary to present more evidence of the advantage of the axillary vein puncture technique . in conclusion , optimized axillary venous approach may be superior to conventional subclavian vein approach for cied lead placement .
the mean time spent in puncture of the axillary vein group was 45.9  14.1 s , whereas in the subclavian vein group , it was 28.7  13.9 s ( t = 9.679 , p < 0.001 ) .
patients aged 18 years or older with the indication of permanent pacemakers , cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers / defibrillators ( crt - p / crt - d ) , and implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( icd ) were included in the study .
the complication rate in perioperative period and follow - ups of the axillary and subclavian vein group was 1.6% ( 2/125 ) and 8.2% ( 10/122 ) , respectively (  = 5.813 , p = 0.016 ) [ table 3 ] . complications in perioperative period and follow - ups
