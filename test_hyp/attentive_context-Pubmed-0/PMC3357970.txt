and in many regards , this specific model is just a representative , and many of its properties , like those building on second moment properties , large deviation theory , quasi - stationarity and early growth and ultimate extinction , extend to more general structures . in the next two sections , neither the mutation probability nor
any mutation step distribution will occur , though in section 3 the fact that we consider two populations , one of which called the resident starts from its carrying capacity , the other called the mutant population starting from one individual , certainly reflects having a mutation probability in mind , which is taken to be small enough for the first population to have grown to its carrying capacity before the mutation occurs . in section 4 , these mechanisms will be made explicit .
the difference from the series of papers by champagnat , ferrire , mlard and lambert lies in our taking discrete time , non - overlapping generations , i.e. galton  watson - style processes as the simple  pure structure for first study .
the assumption of normal distributions is also ad hoc though a central limit style argument from many small effects might have passed through the minds of the first proponents of this distribution for mutational steps .
