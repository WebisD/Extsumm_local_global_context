the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) was first coined by charcot , who postulated the primacy of the upper motor neuron ( umn ) in als pathogenesis.1 assessment of cortical function in als and identification of the characteristic clinical phenotype involving combined upper and lower motor neuron abnormalities remain the key for als diagnosis.24 however , despite charcot 's initial observations , the site of disease onset and mechanisms underlying als pathophysiology remain areas of intense study and debate.5 in this setting , assessment of motor cortical and corticospinal function using non - invasive techniques , such as transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) , has enhanced our understanding of als pathophysiology and resulted in novel diagnostic approaches .
the present review will focus on the mechanisms underlying the generation of these tms measures , while at the same time assessing the contributions tms has made in the understanding of als pathophysiology . with an eye towards the future , the review will also consider the potential diagnostic utility of tms in als and incorporation of tms as a disease biomarker in the assessment of neuroprotective medications in a clinical trial setting .
single- , paired- and multiple - pulse tms techniques have all been used ( figure 1 ) with the following measures taken to reflect corticomotoneuronal function : motor threshold ( mt ) , motor evoked potential ( mep ) amplitude , central motor conduction time ( cmct ) , cortical silent period ( csp ) , intracortical inhibition and facilitation .
