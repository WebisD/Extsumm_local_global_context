patients who had pad showed increased incidence of fu ( 41% versus 4% ; p = 0.001 ) , major amputation ( 14% versus 2% ; p = 0.02 ) , and mortality ( 80.5% versus 29% ; p = 0.001 ) than non - pad . on the other hand , among non - dm patients
patients in fu group also had higher percentage of dm ( 83.3% versus 56% ; p = 0.001 ) , major amputation ( 26% versus 1% ; p = 0.001 ) , need for 3 vascular accesses ( 69% versus 47% ; p = 0.01 ) , and coronary artery disease
development of pad ( 71% versus 32% ; p = 0.001 ) , new foot ulcers ( 47.6% versus 2.4% ; p = 0.001 ) , and need for major amputation ( 16.7% versus 1% ; p = 0.001 ) were significantly higher among fu group as compared to no - fu group . in the following two years ,
also , a high percent of patients needed tunneled catheters ( 88% versus 82% ; p = 0.03 ) and aspirin ( 62% versus 45% ; p = 0.04 ) in the fu group , whereas , history of renal transplant ( 14% versus 2.4% ; p = 0.03 ) was observed more in no - fu group .
