we designed this study to analyze the factors influencing the clinical outcome and efficiency of repeat discectomy for recurrent lumbar disc herniation at the same level and on the ipsilateral side after primary discectomy .
based on the results of this study , repeat discectomy can be recommended for the management of recurrent lumbar disc herniation.however , patients with traumatic event before revision seem to show poor clinical outcome .
conventional open lumbar discectomy performed as a revision surgery for recurrent herniation showed satisfactory results .
the outcome of postoperative clinical symptoms was evaluated using macnab criteria , and the results were as follows : excellent ( 28 ) , good ( 22 ) , fair ( 1 ) , and poor ( n=1 ) .
from january 1990 to september 2011 , a series of 2816 patients underwent lumbar discectomy for disc herniation .
the group consisted of 35 men and 17 women and their average age at repeat discectomy was 40.4 years ( range 18 - 72 years ) ( table 1 ) .
no factors affected clinical outcome of repeat discectomy for recurrent disc herniation assessed by macnab criteria and vas score according by age , sex , diabetes mellitus , smoking , time interval between repeat and primary discectomy , symptom durationbefore the repeat discectomy , and extent of disc herniation . traumatic event showed significantly affected the vas score , however not significantly on the macnab criteria . according to clinical success ,
