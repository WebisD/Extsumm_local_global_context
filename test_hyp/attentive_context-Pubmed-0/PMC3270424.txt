the present study , part of that larger series of sleep deprivation studies , focuses on the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive function in persons at risk for hypertension .
we hypothesize that persons at risk for hypertension will show declines in higher cognitive performance during sleep deprivation .
no consistent differences between high- and low - risk groups in cognitive function were seen at the earlier times of testing , but the cognitive decline in high risk groups emerged most consistently at the 5:30  am and 10:00  am tests , after significant sleep deprivation .
for example , some of studies from our sleep laboratory recently showed that a night of sleep deprivation increased blood pressure in young adults with a positive family history of hypertension versus negative family history controls .
, these results suggest that cns changes may parallel , precede , or even contribute to blood pressure dysregulation in the early stages of the development of hypertension .
young adults at risk for hypertension development later in life show a spectrum of neural , endocrine and circulatory changes during stress   , possibly including the systemic stress of sleep deprivation .
consistent with these and other studies of sleep deprivation , measures of higher cognitive performance declined over time across all participants , regardless of risk status   .
