the concentration of sperm along with the motility and morphological characteristics of the sperm recovered through the two centrifuges were assessed and compared .
ovulation induction combined with iui seems to be the first line of treatment in idiopathic infertility .
the nature of this study was to compare the efficacy of non - temperature and temperature controlled centrifugation on semen preparation techniques for iui and their possible effects on pregnancy outcome in unexplained infertility .
no significant difference in the pregnancy rate was observed between the non - temperature and temperature controlled centrifuge in terms of sperm concentration , motility and morphology .
a total of 671 patients of unexplained infertility were assigned to two different groups : group a ( n = 303 ) had their semen samples prepared by ntc and group b ( n = 368 ) had their semen samples prepared by tc . the patient 's demographic and semen characteristics ( pre- and post - washing ) of the study population between the two groups are shown in tables 1 and 2 .
the present study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of non - temperature and temperature controlled centrifugation on semen preparation techniques for iui and their possible effects on pregnancy outcome in unexplained infertility .
