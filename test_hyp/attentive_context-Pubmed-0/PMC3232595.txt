the sizing of pda for device implantation is based on the automatic calculations of dimension by the inbuilt sizing software in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory and many experienced interventionists believe their eyeball measurements more .
calibration by comparing with the fluoroscopic images of measured metallic sizing devices placed outside body can be misleading because of magnification errors.1 in order to circumvent these problems we suggest some novel ways which take care of magnification errors and avoid the need for aortic root angiography .
the estimations can be erroneous if the calibrations are not proper , leading to catastrophic embolisation of the device , needing emergency surgical removal as was needed in our patient .
technological advances have made nonsurgical closure of the pda a simple and a routine percutaneous intervention .
however making an impression of the ductus by inflating a balloon across it can give a detailed anatomy about the length and breadth of the ductus in multiple planes without the need for multiple dye injection and may help in the selection of proper sized device .
an eight year child with echocardiographically documented 6 mm patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) was planned for device closure .
sizing of atrial septal defect ( asd ) by inflating a balloon across the asd till a circumferential waist is created and measuring the waist ( stretched balloon diameter ) and also inflating the balloon outside by same amount of dye across sized rings , is a standard method.45 using a similar method for the pda is not routine since angiographic visualization is usually adequate .
