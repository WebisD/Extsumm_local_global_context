based on the evaluation of 446 pregnant women with itp , a diagnosis of itp or citp prior to their estimated date of conception may indicate a higher risk for stillbirth or fetal loss , premature delivery , and infants with specific congenital anomalies than an itp diagnosis during pregnancy .
our study is unique because of the availability of data on congenital anomalies in infants born to mothers with itp and citp .
the prevalence of low birthweight was higher among women with a diagnosis of itp before pregnancy ( 10 of 56 or 17.9% ) compared to women with a diagnosis of itp during pregnancy ( 28 of 290 or 9.7% ) .
preterm birth was present in 16/58 ( 27.6% ) infants born to mothers with itp diagnosed prior to pregnancy and in 15/75 ( 20% ) infants born to mothers with itp diagnosed during pregnancy , with an overall prevalence of 23.3% .
therefore , the results of this study provide further evidence that the duration of maternal itp may be an important determinant of the outcomes of pregnancy .
two infants ( 0.6% ) had 3 or more confirmed major malformations . among the subgroup of 68 infants of women with claims for citp , 7/68 ( 10.3% )
