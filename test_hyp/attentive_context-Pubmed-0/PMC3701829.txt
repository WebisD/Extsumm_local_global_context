an 18-year - old man presented with a soft tissue mass of five months ' duration in the right forearm .
soft tissue myoepithelioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue epithelioid and spindle cell neoplasms .
soft tissue myoepithelioma is a rare tumor composed of neoplastic cells with features of myoepithelial differentiation .
the tumor presents as a painless or painful mass in the dermis , subcutis , or deep soft tissue.3,4 while most myoepitheliomas are of salivary gland origin , they have been reported in the soft tissue , retroperitoneum,3 lung,5 and testis.6 the histogenesis of myoepithelial tumors arising in soft tissue is unknown .
recognition of the cytomorphologic features of soft tissue myoepithelioma is necessary for the correct cytological diagnosis .
immunohistochemical expression for epithelial markers ( cytokeratin and/or ema ) , s100 protein or gfap is useful for confirmation of myoepithelial differentiation.3,7 although most cases of myoepithelial neoplasms of soft tissue are benign , approximate 20% have a risk for local recurrence.3 the histopathologic criteria for malignancy in soft tissue myoepithelial neoplasms are moderate to severe cytologic atypia , increase of nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio , nuclear pleomorphism , and readily identifiable nucleoli.2,3 no cytologic features of malignancy were present in this case of myoepithelioma .
