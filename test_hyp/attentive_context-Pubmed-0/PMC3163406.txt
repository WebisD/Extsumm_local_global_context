in conclusion , the present study shows the feasibility of the intramedullary implantation of bmscs in the attempt to rehabilitate the irradiated bone . our data suggested that bmscs appear to remain around the injection site , without evident body redistribution , for at least a 7-day period along with a transient benefice on bone blood flow and bone metabolism .
the assessment of bmscs ' retention and distribution were conducted up to 7 days following transplantation using in - oxine - labeling technique . therapeutic effect on bone perfusion and metabolism
the study was designed to explore , in a rat model of hindlimb irradiation , the feasibility of rehabilitating irradiated tibial bone tissue by intramedullary implanted bmscs .
the pretherapeutic data of the group control and the cell - treated group were resumed in the table 1 . in both groups , compared with the total body activity , irradiation of the hindlimb produced similar alteration in tibial values of bone perfusion blood flow ( early uptake of tc - hdp ) and bone osteoblastic metabolism ( late uptake of tc - hdp ) .
at 2-mo scintigraphic imaging , radiation - induced bone defects appear as areas of attenuation of signal intensity covering the irradiated lower limb , with pronounced effect in the tibia ( see figure 1(b ) , e.g. , ) .
