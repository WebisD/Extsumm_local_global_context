we report what we believe to be the first case of large bowel obstruction caused by an impacted gallstone without primary pathology distal to the stone and discuss potential management options from the literature to rationalize our choice of a defunctioning loop colostomy with the stone left in situ .
gallstone ileus causing small bowel obstruction is a well - document phenomenon ; however , gallstones causing large bowel obstruction are much rarer and almost always secondary to existing bowel pathology .
gallstone ileus is not an uncommon phenomenon ; however , large bowel obstruction due to stone impaction is rarely seen due to the large calibre of the colon , with few case reports in the literature   .
a 92-year male , with no significant co - morbidities apart from peptic ulcers , was admitted with 6 days of obstination . on examination
we believe this to be the first instance that an impacted gallstone has been left in situ post - operatively with a proximal loop colostomy used for symptomatic relief .
on the other hand , it could be left alone , as although fears remain that such a stone might erode through the wall or cause a localized abscess , decompression of the bowel has significantly reduced the chance of pressure necrosis and related complications .
