combining children 's healthcare encounter information from payer records with their immunization records gives a more accurate assessment at each milestone age of the effect of missed opportunities and missed visits on age - appropriate immunizations and overall immunization rates .
this study provides an example of using a milestone approach to assess a specific population and their progression through early childhood immunizations , where both payor - administrative and state - level immunization information system ( iis ) data are available .
however , the results of this study warrant some caution in the use of immunization record data only in assessing failure to have age - appropriate immunizations because of the chance of misclassification of missed opportunities by providers as missed visits by parents
the milestone approach to evaluating early childhood immunizations provides a useful perspective for understanding the time - based progression of children through immunization periods .
. nevertheless , for local assessment by public agencies or health plans , and for the design of interventions to improve immunization rates , looking at the patterns by which children fall behind or catch up on immunizations at milestone periods is a valuable next step beyond the count of vaccine doses received by age two .
