in conclusion , the m - rapc technique is technically feasible , safe , and reproducible ; further , rapc leads to favorable oncological , functional and quality - of - life outcomes in patients eligible for pc .
zero percent of the patients expressed regret and 0% expressed dissatisfaction ( in all 3 domains for both the questions ) .
further , we report on perioperative , oncological , functional , and quality - of - life outcomes in patients undergoing rapc .
no patient had a psm ; a potential psm was prevented ( case 6 ) by virtue of m - rapc , as a positive intraoperative frozen - section lead to further tissue excision from the complementary site on the bladder , with subsequent negative surgical margin ( nsm ) ( on the outer side ) on final pathology .
accordingly , in the current study , we sought to test the feasibility , safety , and reproducibility of a novel ' modification ' of rapc that recapitulates the open technique and allows for intraoperative surgical margin assessment .
this patient ( case 6 ) was a high - risk patient who had developed bca secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy for skin lymphoma , and presented with high - grade multiple urothelial carcinomas ( ucs ) clustered together at the dome ( table 1 ) .
