, we reviewed cases of af in patients treated at the cardiac electrophysiology department of madras medical mission , india , between the years january 2010 and march 2014 , with view to describing the burden of af , electrophysiologic characteristics , associations , lines of management , as well as the initial outcome following radiofrequency catheter ablations ( rfa ) .
this study shows that rfa of af had a high success rate and very low incidence of complication .
we retrospectively studied records of cases of af that underwent cardiac electrophysiologic studies ( eps ) carried out from january 2000 to march 2014 .
basic electrophysiologic characteristics of the study group variable p waves and ventricular rate in surface electrocardiogram irregular potentials from the high right atrium in atrial fibrillation echocardiographic findings were documented in 36 ( 73.5% ) of patients .
asymmetrical septal hypertrophy , left atrial clot with global hypokinesia , severe lv dysfunction , atrial septal defect , and moderate lv dysfunction were all present at frequency of 1 ( 2.8% ) while 17 patients ( 47.2% ) had a normal echo study .
the frequency of associated cardiovascular diseases in the patients studied are diabetes mellitus 8 ( 16.3% ) , hypertension 18 ( 36.7% ) , coronary heart disease 14 ( 28.5% ) , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1 ( 2.0% ) , tachycardia - induced cardiomyopathy 1 ( 2.0% ) , mv prolapsed 1 ( 2.0% ) , dilated cardiomyopathy 1 ( 2.0% ) , degenerative aortic valve disease 1 ( 2.0% ) , atrial septal defect 1 ( 2.0% ) , congenital bicuspid aortic valve 1 ( 2.0% ) , rheumatic heart disease 1 ( 2.0% ) , myxomatous mv 1 ( 2.0% ) , and hypothyroidism 1 ( 2.0% ) . over the study period ,
