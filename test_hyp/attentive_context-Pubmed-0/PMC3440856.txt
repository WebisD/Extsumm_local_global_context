serum levels of ngal reflecting the inflammatory status could show the severity of coronary clinical syndrome ( ua , nstemi , and stemi ) .
in this study , we demonstrated that serum levels of ngal are higher in patients with cad than in healthy controls patients . among acs patients
, our study shows that serum levels of ngal increase in patients with cad with every coronary clinical syndrome and reflect the inflammatory status in the same population . having high negative predictive value
, we hypothesized that levels ngal in blood may reflect the extent of neutrophil activation in various stages of acs and could discriminate various types of acs ( ua , nstemi , and stemi ) and stable from unstable coronary syndromes .
our data agree with the above studies since we found a positive correlation between levels of serum - ngal and systemic inflammation ( expressed by the serum hs - crp levels and neutrophil count ) , and also serum levels of ngal were higher in patients with acs than with sa .
as far as the gradual increase of serum - ngal , according to the seriousness of unstable coronary clinical syndrome , this could reflect the intensity of the inflammatory reaction , as it is expressed by the incremental increase of hs - crp and neutrophil count and their combination with serum ngal . especially between serum - ngal and hs - crp ,
