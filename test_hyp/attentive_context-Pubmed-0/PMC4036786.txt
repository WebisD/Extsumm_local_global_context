we found co - infection with m. perstans in 23% of buruli ulcer patients in a disease - endemic district in ghana , but this prevalence was not significantly difference from prevalence among household contacts who served as controls ( 13% ) .
because filarial nematodes are known to polarize the host immune responses from t - helper type 1 cells needed for protection against mycobacterial infections , toward humoral and t helper type-2 mediated immunity , we plan to undertake a study to investigate this interaction .
as with buruli ulcer , m. perstans filariasis is predominantly found in rural populations and infection begins in childhood ; the highest infection rates are found in children 1014 years of age ( 11 ) , similar to those for children at highest risk for m. ulcerans infection .
our findings suggest that m. perstans nematodes are common in rural ghana and coincidentally infect patients with m. ulcerans disease , necessitating the consideration of these organisms in the management plan of buruli ulcer patients .
we compared the proportion of household controls versus the proportion of buruli ulcer patients infected with m. perstans nematodes and the time to complete healing of m. ulcerans lesions in co - infected versus monoinfected patients .
