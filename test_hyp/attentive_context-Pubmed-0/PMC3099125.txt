this case report discusses a successful treatment outcome of pulpotomy treatment in a symptomatic mature molar with established irreversible pulpitis associate with condensing apical periodontitis .
there is a realistic biological argument to perform pulpotomy as a promising alternative endodontic treatment in mature permanent teeth ; the results of this case clearly show that cem cement can be used clinically in the treatment of a mature molar associated with irreversible pulpitis and condensing apical periodontitis .
there is a body of evidence for biocompatibility and sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate ( mta ) .
six months , one - year , and 2-years follow - ups revealed no clinical or radiographic pathological findings ( i.e. inflammation , infection , calcification , and resorption ) on the first mandibular molar ; radiographs showed normal periodontium apparatus , an evidence of complete periapical healing [ figure 1b  d ] .
( a ) preoperative radiograph shows a large carious lesion associated with a condensing apical periodontitis .
it is well known that the most common cause of pulp / periapical diseases is the presence of bacteria and their by - products within the involved tooth , and the most common pathway of their entrance is through carious lesions ; when further bacterial recontamination is prevented with a good biological seal , the exposed dental pulp has the capability to heal and construct a new dentinal bridge and periapical tissues have the ability of regeneration .
