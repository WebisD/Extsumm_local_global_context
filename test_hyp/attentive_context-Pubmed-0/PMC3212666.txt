accordingly , we conducted a screening test for sti by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) in asymptomatic people .
the prevalences of ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis were 22.1% and 11.6% , respectively . in people who were infected with chlamydia trachomatis , the prevalences of ureaplasma urealyticum ( 35.0% ) and mycoplasma hominis ( 22.5% ) were higher than in those not infected with chlamydia trachomatis ( table 1 , 2 ) .
of these patients , the number of patients with a single pathogen was 47 ( 6.6% ) , for which the number with isolated chlamydia trachomatis , neisseria gonorrhoeae , mycoplasma genitalium , or trichomonas vaginalis was 37 , 1 , 1 , and 8 , respectively .
50 ( 7.1% ) had pathogens of sti in their urinary tract ( table 2 ) .
the prevalences of chlamydia trachomatis , neisseria gonorrhoeae , mycoplasma genitalium , ureaplasma urealyticum , mycoplasma hominis , and trichomonas vaginalis in asymptomatic people were 5.6% ( 40/709 ) , 0.4% ( 3/709 ) , 0.3% ( 2/709 ) , 22.1% ( 157/709 ) , 11.6% ( 82/709 ) , and 1.1% ( 8/709 ) respectively(table 1 ) . among all persons ,
