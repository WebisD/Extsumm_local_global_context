the proposed fe(oh)3 co - precipitation in 1  % ammonium carbonate combines the effective pre - concentration of the trace - level constituents with the removal of the uranium matrix .
the presented method is not just useful for the trace - level nd isotope ratio analysis as demonstrated , but it is also a versatile and straightforward sample preparation procedure , which can be applied to pre - concentrate and separate other elements of interest , such as th , pu or am from a single sample aliquot .
though the primary purpose of the study is the separation of ln , the methodology can be extended for the pre - concentration of other important elements for nuclear forensics present at trace - levels , such as th , am or pu .
nd / ndtru corresponds to the results obtained by using only tru separation , while nd / ndpreconc are the results of the present method with preconcentration moreover , the uncertainty of the new result is almost an order of magnitude better . for shirley basin and can esi the nd isotopic composition
2ree patterns of investigated uranium ore concentrate samples obtained with two different separation procedures : extraction chromatography with tru resin ( tru ) and in this work developed pre - concentration ( preconc ) ree patterns of investigated uranium ore concentrate samples obtained with two different separation procedures : extraction chromatography with tru resin ( tru ) and in this work developed pre - concentration ( preconc ) the nd / nd isotope ratio for three uoc samples ( rssing , shirley basin and can esi ) and bcr-2 geological standard was measured ( table  1 ) .
