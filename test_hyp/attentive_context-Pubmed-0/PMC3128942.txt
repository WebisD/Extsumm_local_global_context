2008 ) and mice ( manuscript in preparation ) to investigate and determine the oncolytic activities and capacities of btvs and their selective degradation of human cancer cells as potential treatment of human cancers .
are now in progress to document and investigate this unique oncolyitc potential of btvs which will provide us better and safer application in humans either in monotherapy or combination therapy in the near future .
as we learn more about cancer biology and oncolytic viruses , new strategies for treating cancers are rapidly evolving .
our ongoing in vitro work with different human cancer cell lines will assist us in elucidating the potential mechanisms of the btv oncolytic activities .
thus , btvs selective cytotoxic effects to human tumor cells in vitro and partially in vivo have been clearly indicated and demonstrated . further in vivo research and clinical studies
is oncolytic btv a vital alternative for cancer therapy ? what are the pathways btv used to carry out this task ?
recent data and epidemiological analysis of many tumors reveal that most fda - approved cancer therapeutic drugs can only provide small incremental improvement and survival to cancer patients .
a significant effort is underway to understand the genetic and mechanistic basis of cancers , selective degradation of cancer cells by these oncolytic viruses , and their effects on downstream cellular events and pathways ( strong et al .
