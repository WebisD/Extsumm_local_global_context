therefore , it was our objective to assess the potential antimicrobial activity of aristolochia bracteolata using a bioassay - guided fractionation , in order to produce pure compound that can act as the lead compound in developing new , safe , and effective drug to replace the use of the harmful crude plant material .
using bioassay - guided fractionation technique , the present study directly linked the antibacterial activity of aristolochia bracteolata to the aa-1 .
aa-1 showed strong activity against moraxella catarrhalis ( standard strain and clinical isolates ) and sea urchin - derived bacillus sp .
the crude extract failed to inhibit the growth of all test fungi in addition to the following bacterial strains : klebsiella pneumoniae , escherichia coli , salmonella typhimurium , streptococcus pyogenes , streptococcus agalactiae , staphylococcus epidermidis , neisseria lactamicus , enterobacter cloacae , bacillus cereus , aeromonas hydrophila , salmonella typhi , vibrio cholerae , and yersinia enterocolitica .  
bioguided fractionation of methanolic extract of aristolochia bracteolata led to isolation of aa-1 and its structure was elucidated by interpretation of its nmr and ms data and by comparison with those reported in the literature .
( table 2 ) , with equal mic and mbc values of 25 and 50  g / ml . both the piperonylic acid moiety of aa-1 ( figure 1 ) and aa-1-methyl ester showed no activity against bacteria ( table 2 ) , which suggests that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa-1 antibacterial activity .
