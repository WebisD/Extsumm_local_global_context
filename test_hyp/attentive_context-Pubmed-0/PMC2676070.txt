these resins have good mechanical properties , being light cured , the operator has some control over the material s working time and colour is relatively stable but marginal fit can be poor.10,13 acrylates and mainly methacrylates were found to cause cytotoxic effects.14 evaluation of the cytotoxicity of dental resin materials showed a relationship between their composition and the degree of cytotoxicity.15 continuous cell lines , like l929 mouse fibroblasts are being routinely used for the testing of cytotoxic properties of dental materials because of their reproducible growth rates and biological responses.1 the purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of current bis - acryl and urethane dimethacrylate based provisional materials on the fibroblast cell viability .
the results showed that , eluates of the revotek lc and protemp 3 garant lead to 99% and 101% cell survival . statistically revotek lc and protemp 3 garant were not cytotoxic for cells when compared to control group ( p>.05 ) .
tempofit duomix was cytotoxic for cells when compared to control group and other tested materials ( p<.05 ) .
the results of this study demonstrated that cytotoxic potential may vary among provisional materials . taking into consideration the limitations of this in vitro study
