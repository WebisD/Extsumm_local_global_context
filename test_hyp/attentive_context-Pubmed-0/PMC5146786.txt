the aim of this study was to determine whether improved intermittent clamping of a drainage tube helps to reduce the drainage amount and avoid complications after dsc and internal fixation .
the mean total drainage amount ( in ml ) of the one- and two - segment procedures was significantly greater in the cnpd group than the icd group ( 272.1  55.2 and 363.2  62.3 vs. 95.6  32.1 and 112.2  33.2 , respectively , p < 0.01 ) .
it is essential to focus on the effect of clamping drainage with long - segment surgical procedure and complex lumbar disease in the further investigation , as well as the effect of clamping on long - term functional outcomes and patient satisfaction .
the drainage amount was significantly greater in the cnpd group as compared to the icd group in 6 h to 48 h ( p < 0.01 ) . especially in the first 24 h , the mean drainage amount in the icd group was significantly less than those in cnpd group ( p < 0.01 ) . however , there was no significant difference between the two groups after 48 h ( p = 0.34 ) .
the mean pressure in the drainage cavity and drainage density were 34.5  2.9 cmh2o and 1.1  0.1 g / m , respectively .
