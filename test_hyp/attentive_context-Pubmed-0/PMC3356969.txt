cbz is still used as a first - line agent along with lithium and valproic acid in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
this was a rare case of life - threatening erythema multiforme major / stevens johnson 's syndrome with the use of cbz when given along with higher doses of valproic acid .
although there are case reports of stevens johnson syndrome ( sjs ) occurring in schizophrenia , bipolar affective disorder , and during a manic episode when treated with cbz , we were unable to find reports of sjs in patients having epilepsy with bipolar affective disorder .
cbz was originally introduced in therapeutic armamentarium as an anticonvulsant , and is known to produce such adverse drug reaction ( adr ) , but the reports are rare .
there is a need of continued adr monitoring and reporting of adrs , more so with the use of cbz .
sjs is a blistering disorder , characterized by mucosal erosions at two or more sites with small blisters and purpuric macules .
drug - induced dermatological reactions are common with the antiepiletic drugs such as carbamazepine ( cbz ) , phenytoin , lamotrigine , ethosuximide , and phenobarbital .
