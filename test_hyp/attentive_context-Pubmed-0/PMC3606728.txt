potential therapies using normal inhabitants of the oral microbiota that have an antagonistic relationship with the red complex are discussed .
studies using animal models have reported the synergistic pathogenicity of mixed infections with p. gingivalis - t .
this paper focuses on interspecies pathogenic interactions within the red complex , in particular the combinations of p. gingivalis - t .
periodontal diseases are polymicrobial immune - inflammatory infectious diseases that can lead to the destruction of periodontal ligaments and adjacent supportive alveolar bone . the subgingival plaque contains more than 700 bacterial species , and some of these microorganisms have been shown to be responsible for initiation / progression of periodontal diseases   .
organisms antagonistic to periodontopathogens that are derived from typical representatives of the oral microbiota and have probiotic potential may overcome the weaknesses associated with exogenous probiotic bacteria .
most therapeutic modalities for treatment of periodontitis aim to remove pathogens and kill all bacteria in the periodontal pocket . understanding the effect of interbacterial interactions on the pathogenesis of periodontitis
these bacteria are not usually found alone , but in combination in the periodontal pockets , suggesting that some bacteria may cause destruction of the periodontal tissue in a cooperative manner .
