as the approval of intravitreal use of bevacizumab and its subsequent availability in the market in single dose ( 0.05 ml ampoules ) is still awaited , using the single - dose vial and aliquoting into smaller doses for multiple uses , is the call of the day .
however , the present incident highlights the risks of microbial contamination and the need to stay vigilant against preexisting contamination within the vial or its access to the drug via multiple pricks . the alternative protocol , as described previously , is recommended to increase the safety margin of the intravitreal injection of bevacizumab .
four of the eight patients reported to the hospital on the 3rd day after injection with complaints of pain , watering , and diminution of vision .
presentation of cases with signs and symptoms of endophthalmitis and response with intravitreal injection of antibiotics led us to assume infective pathology despite the negative culture report .
contaminants could possibly be introduced during the compounding process and compromise the sterility of the aliquoted drug . multiple pricks ( procedure common in india ) were made in vial to prepare administrating dose for eight patients .
while pegaptanib and ranibizumab are labeled for intravitreal use , bevacizumab is labeled for use in cancer therapy and is currently being used  off - label  for the treatment of ocular neovascular diseases .
