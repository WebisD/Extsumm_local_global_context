. this brief review will discuss the mechanisms of emt and suggest strategies for the prevention of emt and preservation of peritoneum during long - term pd .
recent data ( 7 - 9 ) suggest that human peritoneal mesothelial cells ( hpmc ) undergo emt during pd and that emt may play an important role in the development and progression of peritoneal fibrosis leading to failure of peritoneal membrane function
long - term peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) is associated with progressive increase in the thickness of peritoneal membrane , predominantly in the submesothelial compact collagenous zone ( 1 ) , and membrane hyperpermeability ( 2 ) .
cell culture and animal studies suggest that high glucose , gdp , glucose - based pd solution , tgf-1 , loss of bmp-7 , and activation of the mtor pathway induce emt of hpmc and that antioxidants , bmp-7 , and rapamycin may prevent emt and allow better preservation of structural and functional integrity of the peritoneal membrane during long - term pd .
accumulating evidence implicates emt as a potential mechanism for the development and progression of peritoneal fibrosis during long - term pd leading to failure of peritoneal membrane function .
