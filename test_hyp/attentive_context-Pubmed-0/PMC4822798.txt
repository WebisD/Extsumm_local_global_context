auc24/mic ratios of 500 , 700 , and 900 gh / ml gave probabilities of treatment success of 0.50 , 0.72 , and 0.87 , respectively .
we herein examined patients with mrsa infections who were administered with teicoplanin in order to determine the target auc / mic ratio of teicoplanin .
teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that has been used to treat serious , invasive infections caused by gram - positive bacteria.3 the area under the drug concentration  time curve ( auc)/minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) has been identified as a pk / pd parameter of glycopeptide antibiotics that correlated with bacteriological responses and clinical outcomes.4,5 the guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin suggest that an auc / mic ratio of 400 is the pk / pd parameter associated with clinical and bacteriological responses to vancomycin therapy.6,7 although optimized dosing regimens
patients with auc24/mic ratios of 900 had significantly stronger bacteriological responses than those with auc24/mic ratios of < 900 ( p<0.05 ) .
the bacteriological treatment successes were evaluated in 15 patients with auc24/mic ratios of 900 and 31 patients with auc24/mic ratios of < 900 using the kaplan  meier curve analysis ( figure 2 ) .
