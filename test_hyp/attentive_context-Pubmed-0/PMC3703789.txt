is a possible previous step to urinary tract infection , this work was designed to see if there is any difference in papg alleles ' distribution ( especially papg allele ii ) among e. coli vaginal isolates from pregnant and nonpregnant women and also to evaluate the possible ability of papg allele ii isolates to cause pyelonephritis by genotypic analyses of e. coli phylogenetic groups and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli virulence factors ( expec vfs ) .
papg vaginal isolates clustered in groups b2 ( 78.2% ) and d ( 21.7% ) , whereas all of the fecal isolates clustered in group d. except for sfa / foc , for all the studied vfs ' genes ( table 5 ) , papg vaginal isolates did not differ significantly in comparison with papg fecal isolates . also pregnant and nonpregnant
so , it can be concluded that vaginal colonization by papg allele ii  e. coli is possibly one of the predisposing factors of both pregnant and nonpregnant women to pyelonephritis , but its potential is modified by other factors especially host factors .
the possible role of vaginal colonization by such isolates as predisposing factor to pyelonephritis can not be excluded and required further in vitro and in vivo analyses , as it previously had been found that vaginal colonization by e. coli represents an intermediate stage in extraintestinal e. coli pathogenesis   and women often suffer from an enhanced susceptibility to recurrent urinary and genital tract infections in association with uropathogenic e. coli strains .
