single - crystalline kinked nanowires were synthesized by the nanocluster - catalyzed vls method described previously18,19 in quartz tube connected to gas manifold and vacuum pump and heated by a temperature controlled tube furnace .
the silicon ( si ) nanowires were synthesized at 450460 c using silane ( sih4 ) as the silicon reactant source , hydrogen ( h2 ) as the carrier gas , and phosphine ( ph3 , 1,000 p.p.m . in h2 ) and diborane ( b2h6,100 p.p.m . in h2 ) as the n- and p - type dopants . in a typical synthesis of uniform n - type , 80 nm kinked silicon nanowires ,
p - n silicon nanowires were 500:1 for both p - and n - type segments . in n - kink - n - kink-(n - n ) dopant modulated silicon nanowires , the silicon - phosphorus feed - in ratios were 200:1 and 10000:1 for n- and n - type segments , respectively , and the n- segment was grown for 30 s. germanium nanowires were synthesized at 270290 c , 40 torr , with germane ( geh4 , 10 % in h2 ) and h2 as the reactant and carrier gas , respectively .
