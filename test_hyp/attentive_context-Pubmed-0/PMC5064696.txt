the secondary outcomes measured were number of insertion attempts , insertion time , ease of insertion of size sgds ( 2 i - gel or plma ) and orogastric catheter , quality of initial airway , fibre - optic grading and pulmonary mechanics .
size 2 i - gel exhibited superior oropharyngeal leak pressure and quality of airway in paediatric patients with controlled ventilation as compared to same sized plma although the pulmonary mechanics were similar .
the oropharyngeal leak pressure in i - gel group was 29.5  2.5 ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 2830 ) cmh2 o as compared to 26.1  3.8 ( 95% ci , 2427 ) cmh2 o in plma group ( p = 0.002 ) [ table 2 , figure 2 ] .
the primary aim of the present study was to compare oropharyngeal leak pressure of size 2 i - gel and plma for airway management in paediatric patients .
the quality of initial airway was better in i - gel as compared to plma ( p = 0.018 ) .
insertion time was shorter for i - gel as compared to plma and none of the patients had failures in the insertion of sads .
