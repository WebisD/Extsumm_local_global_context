we present a case of giant renal aml , which is the heaviest ever reported , encountered in a tertiary care hospital in india .
renal angiomyolipoma ( aml ) is an infrequent tumor that , in most cases , follows a benign course and has clearly defined radiological and histological characteristics .
a 49-year - old lady , a native of afghanistan , presented with a 3-year history of steadily increasing abdominal girth and bloating sensation in the abdomen .
we present a case where the patient presented with a huge abdominal mass in the left kidney diagnosed as aml and was managed by left nephrectomy .
, an estimated 20 - 30% of amls are found in patients with ts syndrome , which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mental retardation , epilepsy , and adenoma sebaceum .
she underwent investigation in another institute and was found to have a huge abdominal mass .
aml is the only benign renal tumor that is confidently diagnosed on cross - sectional imaging .
positive immuno - histochemical staining by hmb-45 ( a melanosome - associated protein ) for epithelioid component confirms the lesion as aml .
the giant tumor is the heaviest aml ever reported in the literature . at 6 months post - operative follow - up
