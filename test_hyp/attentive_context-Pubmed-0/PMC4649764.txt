the principle of informed choice and the harm of overdiagnosis are well recognized in prostate cancer screening , and both are applicable to screening mammography . screening mammography is a complex topic , and many seemingly plausible screening statistics are misleading .
overdiagnosis distorts screening statistics and can change the delicate balance between benefit and harms from positive to negative .
the simplistic but effective mantra that  early detection saves lives  is one cause of the general enthusiasm for cancer screening . in the united states ( u.s . ) , a double standard exists : women are encouraged to participate in screening mammography , while men are advised to make informed decisions regarding prostate screening , although the fundamental issues to consider are very similar .
one challenge is that important screening harms are often not mentioned or misrepresented in promotional campaigns for screening and in the medical literature .
while professional society screening guidelines generally promote breast screening , they may be influenced by intellectual and financial conflicts of interest and generally have a poor evidence base compared with , for example , those from the u.s .
the typical adult individual seen by a primary care physician most likely believes that cancer screening is a good idea , but without comprehending the trade - off of harms to benefit or the uncertainties surrounding their magnitude .
