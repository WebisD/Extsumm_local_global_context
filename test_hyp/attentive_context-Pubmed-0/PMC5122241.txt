urbanism , increased life expectancy , reduction in childbirth , aging and elderly population , epidemiological changes , socioeconomic status , geographical conditions , and lifestyles such as poor diet , stress , and low mobility are the main causes of the burden of noncommunicable diseases , particularly stroke . because the determinants of stroke in different communities are various , we require knowledge about the risk factors and determinants of mortality in a community for effective planning and selection of appropriate strategies for the prevention and management of stroke and heart attack as the most important causes of death . since no comprehensive study has yet been investigated the status and mortality determinants of stroke in mi patients in iran , this study is conducted to determine and compare the determinants of mortality due to stroke in mi patients .
the adjusted or of mortality in patients with stroke history was derived 7.02 ( 95% ci : 5.429 ) for chest pain resistant to treatment , 2.39 ( 95% ci : 1.972.9 ) for stemi , 3.02 ( 95% ci : 2.53.64 ) for lack of thrombolytic therapy , 2.2 ( 95% ci : 1.662.91 ) for heart failure , and 2.17 ( 95% ci : 1.62.9 ) for ventricular tachycardia . considering other potential covariates and the confounders of hospital mortality in patients with stroke , we obtained the highest adjusted or of hospital mortality in patients with stroke for chest pain resistant to treatment followed by lack of thrombolytic therapy and stemi .
