the objectives of this study were ( 1 ) to use an ex vivo split tooth model to simulate the bacterial biofilm ( 2 ) to use the above biofilm model to assess the influence of various factors like canal taper , volume of the irrigant , mode of irrigation , open port of the needle upon the removal of bio - molecular film at various levels of root canal .
within the limitations of this study , it can be concluded that a bacterial biofilm , adherent to the root canal surface at the apical third of the root canal may be efficiently removed by : 
 sufficient enlargement of the canal by increasing the canal taper.agitation of an irrigant , with an passive ultrasonically activated file.irrigation of the canal with a side vent needle like max-i-probe.large volumes of irrigant imparting lavaging effect . 
 
two types of ultrasonic irrigation has been described in the literature : one where irrigation is combined with simultaneous ultrasonic instrumentation ( ultrasonic instrumentation ) and another related to the non cutting action of the ultrasonically activated file called as passive ultrasonic instrumentation.7 the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficiency of two irrigating techniques - static and dynamic ( passive ultrasonic instrumentation ) irrigation in the elimination of bacterial biofilm .
