therefore , we wondered whether application of a synthetic oligodesoxynucleotide ( 1668-thioate ) would be sufficient to depress cardiac function in vivo . with respect to the importance of effective inhibition of tlr signaling in sepsis , the aim of the present study was to test different tlr9 inhibitors ( h154-thioate , irs954-thioate , and chloroquine ) for their effectiveness in protecting the cardiovascular system during systemic inflammation . in order to distinguish tlr9 signaling from other inflammatory pathways the specific tlr9 ligand 1668-thioate was chosen as stimulus .
taken together , here we show that systemic tlr9 stimulation is able to depress cardiac function in vivo and that a pharmacological intervention is possible and may be a promising strategy for human clinical trials in future .
the present results are first to formally demonstrate that specific tlr9 stimulation with 1668-thioate lowers hemodynamic parameters in vivo in a murine model of systemic inflammation .
chloroquine application induced a biphasic response of il-6 , enhancing its expression at 2  h and diminishing it at 6  h ( figures 3(e ) and 3(f ) ) . in cardiac tissue of tlr9-d animals , application of 1668-thioate did not influence the mrna expression of the investigated mediators . in clinical symptoms and survival as well as in cytokine
