the similarity of some benign lesions and normal breast structures to malignant neoplastic lesions ( false positive results ) ; the similarity of some malignant lesions to normal breast structures or benign lesions ( false negative results ) ; the characteristics of some breast diseases , with the absence of focal lesion ( both false negative and false positive results ) ; lack of visualization of the lesion by the examiner ( false negative results ) ; technical aspects ( false positive and false negative results ) .
should be included in the program of prophylactic breast cancer examinations . in high and very high risk groups of breast cancer morbidity
to improve penetration , an increase in general beam enhancement and/or compression force on the examined breast can be used . in the case of large breasts , breasts during lactation , breast inflammation , inflammatory cancer or breasts with radiation lesions , the number of errors can be decreased using a linear transducer of lower frequency , e.g. 5 mhz .
this can result from : the similarity of some benign lesions and normal breast structures to malignant neoplastic lesions ( false positive results);the similarity of some malignant lesions to normal breast structures or benign lesions ( false negative results);the characteristics of some breast diseases , with the absence of focal lesion ( both false negative and false positive results);lack of visualization of the lesion by the examiner ( false negative results);technical aspects ( false positive and false negative results ) .
