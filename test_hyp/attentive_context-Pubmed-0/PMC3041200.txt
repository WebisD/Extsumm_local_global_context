an increasing burden of diabetes was observed in non - south asian and south asian children and young people , with a rising incidence of type 1 diabetes confirmed in children ( 3,4 ) and stable rates for young adults ( 1,2 ) .
although the proportion of south asians in the diabetes population ( 13% ) was similar to the background population , south asians had a lower incidence of type 1 diabetes but an excess of type 2 , with an apparent shift from diagnosis of type 1 to type 2 from 2000 onwards .
data on individuals aged 029 years diagnosed with any type of diabetes ( excluding gestational ) from 1 january 1991 to 31 december 2006 were extracted from clinical notes by a dedicated register manager and entered onto the population - based yorkshire register of diabetes in children and young people for residents of west yorkshire , which has a 97.6% level of completeness ( 1 ) .
the incidence of type 1 diabetes was 17.6 ( 16.918.3 ) , with significantly higher rates in non - south asians ( 18.3   ) than in south asians ( 13.1   ) .
the previously reported steep rise in incidence of type 1 diabetes in south asian children up to 1999 ( 5 ) was not sustained , possibly as a result of a change in the recognition that type 2 and other forms of diabetes are emerging in younger age groups .
