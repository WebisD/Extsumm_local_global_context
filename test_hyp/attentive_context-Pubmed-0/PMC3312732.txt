antibiotics can often be prescribed to the patients who are non - responsive to conventional mechanical therapy , for patients with acute periodontal infections associated with systemic manifestations , as a prophylactic agent in medically compromised patients and as an adjunct to mechanical therapy .
periodontal disease is a multifactorial disease , characterized by periodontal pocket formation , loss of clinical attachment , and alveolar bone resorption .
this case report presents a case of a female patient with severe gingival inflammation , bleeding gums even on the slightest provocation , and generalized deep periodontal pockets .
a 28-year - old female patient reported with complaints of generalized swollen gums since last one year , preventing proper speech , articulation , and mastication causing inadequate lip apposition and poor aesthetics .
however , dynamic interactions between bacterial factors and host response with genetic and environmental factors are considered as the primary cause for tissue destruction in periodontitis . in consideration to this bacterial - host response , treatment approach to periodontitis should be conventional mechanical debridement and the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents .
oral hygiene maintenance and the plaque accumulation have a very crucial effect on prognosis of any periodontal therapy .
