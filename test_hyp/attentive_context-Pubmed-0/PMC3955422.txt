the objective of this cross - sectional study was to assess the relationship of sperm parameters as well as chromatin integrity and apoptosis with iui outcomes in two groups of patients with female or mild male factor infertility .
according to infertility etiology , patients were divided into two groups with mild male factor ( group m ; n = 29 ) and female factor infertility ( group f ; n = 31 ) .
this study confirmed that there was no correlation between abnormal sperm morphology and high rate of dna damage in iui program .
therefore , this technology may not be recommended for patients with mild male infertility , since high rate of dna damage was observed in their spermatozoa .
non - pregnant group showed a significant number of immotile sperm , when compared with pregnant patients ( p < 0.01 ) .
comparisons of sperm parameters in two groups with female or male factor infertility undergoing iui data are presented as meansd , ns : not significant , values inside parentheses represent ( % ) comparisons of sperm characteristics in pregnant and non - pregnant patients data are presented as meansd , ns : not significant , values inside parentheses represent ( % ) the findings also showed that the rate of sperm with protamine deficiency increased in sperm samples from patients with mild male infertility , when compared with the other group ( p < 0.01 ; figure 1 ) . also , the rate of protamine deficiency significantly increased in non - pregnant when compared with pregnant patients ( p < 0.05 ; table 2 ) .
