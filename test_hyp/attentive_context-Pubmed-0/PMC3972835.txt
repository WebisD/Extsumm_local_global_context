the significant proportion of pregnant women infected by hsv-2 that presented morphological alterations in the uterine cervix suggests the importance of including the colposcopy or cytology exams as part of routine prenatal care .
however , the prevalences of hsv-2 were significantly higher in women with colposcopy abnormalities in both pregnant and nonpregnant women , compared to those with normal colposcopy ( table 2 ) .
we evaluated the prevalence for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 genital infection among pregnant and nonpregnant women , its association with the presence of cervical abnormalities detected by colposcopy and cytology , sociodemographic characteristics , and reproductive activity .
results of the current study show a high prevalence rate of both hsv-1 and hsv-2 in the studied population .
we observed in this study a higher proportion of women infected with hsv-2 among those who had abnormal colposcopy and/or cytology , in both groups of pregnant and nonpregnant women .
the presence of any of the serotypes of hsv alone or both together was detected in 95 women , revealing an overall prevalence of 40.3% of genital infection in the studied population ( 23.7% hsv-1 alone , 11.9% hsv-2 alone , and 4.7% the two serotypes together ) .
