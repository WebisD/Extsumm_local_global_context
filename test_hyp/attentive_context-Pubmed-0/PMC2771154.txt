we investigated the role of candidate gene polymorphisms in a case - control study of patients with large adenomatous polyps ( n = 295 ) , compared to patients with small adenomatous polyps ( n = 302 ) and polyp - free controls ( n = 568 ) .
analysis of single polymorphisms for the different comparisons , la versus pf , la versus sa , and sa versus pf did not reveal any association for most of the genes studied .
we investigated , through a case - control study , the relation between polymorphisms within a series of candidate genes involved in colorectal tumorigenesis and putatively in the formation and the development of colorectal adenomas such carcinogen metabolism enzymes , methylation enzymes , dna repair genes , oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes .
thus , our negative results certainly do not definitively demonstrate the absence of specific combination influencing colorectal tumorigenesis , but more probably that , if it exists , this ( of these ) effect(s ) is ( are ) low and could be found through the initial ( and further ) genome - wide association studies of colorectal cancer testing much larger numbers of patients and controls   .
