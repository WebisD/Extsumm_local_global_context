based on the results , we found that unprocessed digital images had higher diagnostic accuracy than inverted images for detection of small and large peri - implant defects .
this study aimed to compare the diagnostic value of unprocessed ( psp ) and inverted digital images for detection of peri - implant defects using scanora software .
based on the results , unprocessed images had a higher diagnostic value than inverted images . according to the t - test , in the equality of the means , no significant difference was detected in the sensitivity of unprocessed and inverted images for detection of peri - implant defects ( absolute positive predictive value ) and for detection of a probable lesion ( complete positive predictive value)(p>0.05 ) .
the mean  standard deviation of absolute and complete negative and positive predictive values of unprocessed and inverted images the mean  standard deviation of sensitivity and specificity of unprocessed and inverted images for detection of small and large defects significantly different from zero ( p<0.05 ) considering the equality of variances , the t - test showed that unprocessed images had a higher absolute sensitivity for detection of small defects than inverted images ( p=0.48 ) .
