hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection is a leading cause of end - stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma   .
we presented a female patient with living donor - related graft reinfection with hcv genotype 2a who was treated with a combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks .
12-week treatment with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin is relatively safe and highly effective for the eradication of hcv genotype 2 in ldlt patients .
the use of interferon - free regimens is possible for the eradication of hcv in post - ldlt patients with grafts from hepatitis b core antibody - positive donors , as was demonstrated by our patient , who was successfully treated with hbig and entecavir to prevent hbv reactivation . in conclusion ,
a 66-year - old japanese woman developed liver failure due to cirrhosis and hcv genotype 2a infection .
hcv genotype 2a was eradicated by a 12-week treatment with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with hbig plus entecavir , one of the nucleos(t)ide analogs , for the successful prevention of hbv reappearance .
unfortunately , liver transplantation is not a cure for hcv infection , and the occurrence of graft reinfection with hcv is universal , leading to progression of liver fibrosis and occasionally to graft loss at rates higher than in transplant patients not infected with hcv   . in japan , because of long - standing legal difficulties associated with cadaveric donation , ldlt is the main type of liver transplantation for end - stage liver disease .
