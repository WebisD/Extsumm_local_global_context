adult onset retinoblastoma is a rare intraocular malignancy that has been previously reported in the literature.12 many of the reported cases have been treated with enucleation due to the advanced nature of the disease .
focal therapy and chemotherapy have also been attempted , but with poor outcomes.34 here we report a case of adult onset retinoblastoma , which initially responded very well to chemotherapy ; however , massive recurrence of the tumor necessitated enucleation of the eye .
a 30-year - old female diagnosed elsewhere with choroidal melanoma with retinal detachment , presented to our emergency department with complaints of seeing black spot in front of the right eye accompanied with intermittent flashes for 20 days . on examination , the best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) was 6/9 in the right eye and 6/5 in the left eye .
attempts to salvage the globe in adult onset retinoblastoma with chemoreduction and focal therapy may be possible ; however , regular long - term follow - up is needed for potential recurrence , which mandate timely intervention .
what was unique to our case was that it showed excellent response initially and had near normal vision and then failed therapy with reactivation necessitating enucleation . whether it is the genetic make - up of the adult onset retinoblastoma that makes it difficult to salvage the eye ,
