population , we found an increased percentage of aas and hispanics with type 2 dm and early ckd associated with both crp and uae .
we postulated that in contrast to the general population , the prevalence of early ckd in patients with primarily type 2 dm would be higher in aas and hispanics than in whites . in the current study , we tested this hypothesis in the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) 19992008 and speculated that elevated levels of systemic inflammatory markers in general , and crp in particular , may be associated with the posited increase in early ckd ( egfr 60 ml / min/1.73 m and urinary albumin excretion [ uae ]  30 g / ml ) in racial / ethnic minorities .
aas had higher crp and fibrinogen levels ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 , respectively ) and lower wbc levels ( p < 0.01 ) relative to whites and hispanics .
relative to whites and aas , hispanics had a lower prevalence of cvd , uric acid , and history of smoking ( p < 0.01 ) .
we also showed that diabetic aas and hispanics had a higher prevalence of early ckd compared with whites , and we found higher levels of uae in aas and hispanics , higher absolute crp levels in aas , and an association between crp and uae in aas and hispanics ( stronger in hispanics ) , providing additional evidence for a role of inflammation in the increased prevalence of early diabetic ckd in both ethnic groups .
