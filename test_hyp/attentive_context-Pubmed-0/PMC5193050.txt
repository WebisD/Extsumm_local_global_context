taking advantage of the widespread symbiotic interactions pre - existing between yeast and drosophila , we have recently developed an oral delivery method to induce rna interference ( rnai ) in a pest insect by knocking down essential genes expressed in its digestive tract ( fig .  1 ) .
the fact that the target insect for our study , d. suzukii , is a species without systemic rnai mechanism suggests that our approach may even be more effective in species with systemic rnai , in which the silencing signal can be more efficiently disseminated beyond the intial target cells , i.e. cells in the digestive tract .
recent advances in genetic and molecular biology offer a broad range of powerful technologies to manipulate expression and function of specific genes . with the development of genome engineering methods like znfs , talens and
we propose that microbial delivery of dsrna for gene silencing may be less time - consuming and labor - intensive than genome engineering and could be potentially applied to a broad range of organisms for reverse genetics study as well as integrated pest management .
in addition , it remains to be tested in future experiments whether the delivery of dsrna by microbes , rather than naked dsrnas , could enhance the propagation of the rnai silencing signal .
