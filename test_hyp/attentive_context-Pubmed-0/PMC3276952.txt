premature ovarian aging ( poa ) is defined by elevated age - specific basal follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ) cut - off levels with menstruation .
they proved the hypotheses that poa is a precursor stage of pof and hence requires similar evaluation .
a total of 21 cases of pof with triple x syndrome have been reported in the literature , but to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report of poa with triple x syndrome .
 concluded that presumed underlying etiologies of poa follow a similar distribution pattern as reported for pof .
can we extend causes of pof to poa ? if causes are similar and we evaluate women for poa , can we delay the process of pof ? with these thoughts , we evaluated this patient and we are reporting the case . a study by gleicher et al . titled
prenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with triple x syndrome is definitely required as there will be 25% chance of x chromosomal abnormalities in the offspring .
hence , we conclude that it is essential to consider karyotyping for all cases of poa , and age - specific basal fsh values will help us detect cases of poa .
