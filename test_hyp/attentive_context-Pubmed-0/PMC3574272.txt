, could lessons learned from global efforts to control malaria help inform strategies to prevent and perhaps reverse the spread of dengue ? in this personal view , we compare and contrast malaria and dengue with respect to epidemiology , current and future interventions available for prevention and control , and their prioritisation as global health issues , in terms of funding , capacity , and international collaborations .
we also argue that improved data on the range and endemicity of dengue are a vital component of global prevention and control efforts .
based on lessons learned from malaria control , we propose that development of better methods to quantify dengue endemicity and disease burden , permitting comparisons across countries and regions , is an essential step towards halting the current rise in disease range and intensity
this fact reinforces the importance of developing improved indicators of local , regional , and global dengue endemicity and disease burden , to advocate for funding directed to areas of greatest need , to identify locations where interventions are most likely to succeed , and to monitor future progress of disease prevention efforts , including vaccines .
, dengue is a vector - borne disease of the tropics and is a major cause of morbidity in endemic areas , particularly in children and young adults ; however , the scale of dengue morbidity and mortality is uncertain and thought to be less than that of malaria .
