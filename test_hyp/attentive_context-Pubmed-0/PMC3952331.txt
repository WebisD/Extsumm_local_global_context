phenobarbital ( pb ) is added if the seizures continue.3 a pharmacologically induced coma , using the barbiturates , propofol or midazolam , is also a frequently used therapy for refractory status epilepticus ( rse),2,4,5 which is defined as the persistence of discrete seizures without return to baseline , despite treatment with benzodiazepines and at least two adequate aeds.6,7 however , it requires artificial ventilation and hemodynamic support , and is associated with significant complications and increased mortality.2,4 topiramate ( tpm ) is an aed with demonstrated efficacy for a broad spectrum of seizure types8 ; it has multiple activities at receptors and ion channels that may be more effective than conventional anticonvulsants in treating rse.7,9 we report our experience with the use of tpm for the treatment of benzodiazepine - refractory status epilepticus ( se ) or recurrent seizures in 16 patients who are under severe medical complications such as systemic infection , renal dysfunction , hepatic dysfunction , and pancytopenia from bone marrow suppression .
generalized convulsive status epilepticus ( gcse ) and non - convulsive status epilepticus ( ncse ) are important neurological conditions potentially associated with significant morbidity and mortality.1 even with the best current practice , the mortality of patients with refractory gcse is up to 50% .
