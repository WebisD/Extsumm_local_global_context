although these are preliminary data , they are likely to contribute to establishing the role of specific concentrates for the long - term prophylaxis of severe cases of vwd . nevertheless , a large collection of clinical data is needed so as to assess regimens , comparative effectiveness , and the cost - effectiveness of long - term prophylaxis treatment in patients with vwd , in order to evaluate which of the available concentrates has a better cost  benefit ratio in patients with severe vwd .
this analysis shows that vwf with a low fviii content was more able to control bleeding episodes and , consequently , to reduce the health care interventions necessary , with respect to vwf / fviii concentrates , in four patients with severe vwd .
the analysis has been based on four case reports of type 3 ( n=1 ) , type 2 m ( n=1 ) and type 1 ( n=2 ) vwd from hemophilia centers at the molinette hospital of turin and university hospital of catania on the long - term treatment of vwd with vwf / fviii concentrates and vwf with a low fviii content .
von willebrand disease ( vwd ) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder , with a prevalence of approximately 1% according to population studies,1 but clinically relevant cases have a tenfold lower prevalence.2 the 2011registro nazionale delle coagulopatie congenite [ national registry of congenital coagulopathy],3 which reports data relative to 51 of 54 hemophilia centers in italy , indicated that a total of 8,411 subjects are affected by coagulation disorders  25% by vwd ; 43% by hemophilia a ; 9% by hemophilia b ; 14% by disorders of other coagulation factors ; and 9% by platelet disorders , carrier hemophilia a / b , or other disorders .
