melting point determinations 
 were performed by the open capillary method and are reported uncorrected .
low- and high - resolution 
 mass spectra were recorded on a time - of - fight mass spectrometer using 
 electron impact ( ei ) .
authentic 
 samples of products were used to determine response factors relative 
 to tetradecane , a known amount of which was added to reaction mixtures 
 to allow quantification of product yields .
h and c nmr chemical shifts (  ) are reported 
 in parts per million ( ppm ) relative to tms , and coupling constants j are reported to the nearest 0.1 hz .
c , ch , ch2 , or ch3c signals are assigned from dept-90 
 and 135 spectra . in a number of cases ,
characterization 
 details of the other boronate esters 13 can be found 
 in our previous publication .
carbon atoms attached to boron 
 gave very broad peaks in c nmr spectra , and these could 
 not always be distinguished .
boronate 
 esters 3 where r = bu , i - pr , and cyclohexyl 
 were prepared from the reaction of their corresponding boronic acids 
 with pinacol in pentane in 73 , 36 , and 32% yields , respectively .
