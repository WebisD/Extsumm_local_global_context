, we describe a rare case in which a lesion was initially thought to be a single tumor but was ultimately diagnosed as 2 contiguous tumors ( malt lymphoma and hemangioma ) using contrast - enhanced ultrasonography ( ceus ) with sonazoid ( daiichi sankyo , tokyo , japan ) .
most cases are diffuse large b - cell lymphoma , and the incidence of hepatic malt lymphoma is low among cases of primary hepatic malignant lymphoma   . here
marginal zone b - cell malignant lymphoma is a low - grade malignant non - hodgkin 's lymphoma that develops in mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) .
the lesion in our patient was initially considered to be a single tumor , but contiguous hepatic malt lymphoma and hemangioma were actually present .
the concomitant occurrence of these tumors is rare , and no cases with 2 tumors in contact have been previously reported .
the patient was a 60-year - old female in whom a tumor of 15 mm in diameter was detected in the couinaud 's segment ( s6 ) of the liver on the grayscale us in a medical examination .
the tumors gave different enhancement patterns on ceus and their presence was confirmed histopathologically , based on which we were able to make the final diagnosis .
