this reaffirms that , currently , qspr methodologies 
 are the most - accurate and time - efficient methods for accurate solution 
 free energy predictions . in addition , we show that state - of - the - art 
 machine learning methods , with a modest number of cheminformatics 
 descriptors , are capable of making solution free - energy predictions 
 that are consistent with those of commercially available programs 
 and newer deep - learning approaches . here
since both sets of descriptors ( theoretical 
 energies and cheminformatics descriptors ) produce a similar level 
 of accuracy when used alone in the machine learning methods , and little 
 improvement is seen when they are combined , we can conclude that the 
 information conveyed is of a similar nature and that the theoretical 
 energies are , for this reason , a more efficient form of information 
 storage , as 10 descriptors contain equivalent information to 123 molecular 
 descriptors .
the closest thing to an exception among contemporary 
 theoretical models may be 1d rism , which requires only a few minutes 
 of calculation time per compound and has been previously combined 
 with cheminformatics to build the 1d - rism / sdc method . by combining lower levels of theoretical chemistry 
 with cheminformatics , 
 we hope to produce results in good agreement with experiment , but 
 at a lower cost than higher - level theoretical methods , and with higher 
 accuracy than using cheminformatics descriptors alone .
