preoperative embolization and the postoperative methotrexate therapy facilitate the safe surgical treatment of abdominal pregnancy .
the placenta was left in the abdominal cavity because of the high risk of massive and often uncontrollable bleeding , and treatment with methotrexate was applied postoperatively .
the authors report the case of a 17-week intact abdominal pregnancy diagnosed in the course of an investigation of lower abdominal pain .
subsequent angiography was performed to occlude the supportive artery of the pregnancy by selective embolization .
reports on its frequency vary , ranging from 1 in 3371 deliveries to greater than 1 in 10 200 deliveries   .
as in the majority of cases in the literature , the outcome of our case was successful . therefore , preoperative selective angiography and embolization followed by laparotomy and adjuvant methotrexate therapy can be a safe and effective method in the treatment of abdominal pregnancies in the second trimester .
retaining the placenta in its original place is a common method during operative procedures of abdominal pregnancies .
the main indication was massive pelvic hemorrhage ( eg , in certain cases of advanced , bulky cervical cancers ) . in our case ,
methotrexate therapy is a well - known alternative treatment in certain cases of ectopic pregnancies in order to hasten trophoblastic degeneration . in this case , it was administered in the postoperative interval to promote the absorption of the retained placenta .
