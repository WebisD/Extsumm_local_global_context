finally , this study raises several issues that require further investigation : assess the prevalence and incidence of hev infection throughout the algerian territory , identify the risk factors other than age ( e.g. , socioeconomic condition , working in animal breeding , working in the health sector , and co - infection with other pathogens ) , and evaluate the risk of transmission via blood donation .
the seroprevalence of hev is 46% in healthy people , 22% in blood donors , and 12% in pregnant women ( 23 , 24 ) .
the results revealed that the immunoreactivity of anti - hev antibodies raised against genotype 1 strains was stronger than that against the p166 antigens generated from genotypes 1 and 2 ( p166w01 and p166mex ) and that against the p166 antigens generated from genotypes 3 and 4 ( p166us and p166chn ) .
the prevalence of anti - hev antibodies reached 84.3% in pregnant women , 67.6% in rural areas , 56.4% in semi - urban areas , and 45.3% in blood donors ( 19 - 21 ) . in morocco ,
by contrast , the reaction of anti - hev antibodies raised against the zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4 was more significant than that against the p166 antigens generated from genotypes 3 and 4 ( p166us and p166chn ) as shown in figure 1
