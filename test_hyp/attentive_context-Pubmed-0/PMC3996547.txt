( in press ) . we therefore conclude that common polymorphism within the apoe gene is likely not a major genetic determinant of left - handedness in adults .
left - handedness was the dependent variables coded as 0 ( non - left - handed ) and 1 ( left - handed ) ; the presence of apoe2 allele was coded as 0 ( no apoe2 allele present ) and 1 ( at least one apoe2 allele present ) . adjusted for age and sex further analyses , stratified by 5-year age group , did not reveal any significant association between left - handedness and apoe genotype in any age group , nor any interactions between apoe and age group ( table 2 ) .
the distribution of left - handers based on either self - report or grip strength did not differ between carriers of different apoe genotypes ; the p - values were 0.828 (  2.1 , 5 df ) and 0.557 (  3.9 , 5 df ) ( table 1 ) .
the assessment of handedness in our study was based on subjective self - report and on measurement of grip strength , not allowing to us to detect the potential ambidextrous individuals .
