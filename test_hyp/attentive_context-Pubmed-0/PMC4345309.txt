we review previous paediatric cases of this unusual vascular injury to highlight the pathology and most appropriate management option .
traumatic arterial occlusion following major or minor blunt trauma , especially in the absence of any other bony injury , is a rare phenomenon . 
a 15-year - old male presented to the emergency department following a direct blow from his bicycle handlebars to his groin .
long - term follow - up , beyond the 12-month period , is needed , particularly in relation to known vascular complications including pseudoaneurysms , arteriovenous fistula formation and restenosis .
injury to iliac vessels remains exceedingly rare , given its posterior position within the pelvis , representing only 0.4% of vascular injuries . in this case , we highlight a delayed presentation of external iliac artery occlusion secondary to  motor - scooter handlebar syndrome , in a paediatric patient .
motor - scooter handlebar syndrome is one such type of arterial occlusion affecting vascular structures following direct blow by a handlebar of a motorbike or bicycle to the groin .
the latter two were contraindicated in our patient and open surgery was the most appropriate option .
only a handful of paediatric cases have been reported   . the common femoral vessel is the most commonly affected vascular structure .
