mean volume flow in patients with steal was 1542  ml / min compared to 1087  ml / min ( p < 0.002 ) in patients without evidence of steal .
however , a significant difference in flow volumes between those with steal and without steal syndrome was only seen in patients with brachial - cephalic upper arm avf ( p < 0.002 ) .
when comparing between types of access in patients with steal syndrome , brachial - cephalic upper arm avfs had significantly higher volume flows than the upper extremity av graft ( avg ) group ( p = 0.04 ) .  
women were more likely to present with steal than men ( chi - squared test p < 0.04 ) .  
this was a retrospective review of 118 consecutive patients who underwent us exams of their functioning hemodialysis access during a 30-month period .
one hundred and eighteen consecutive patients of which 82 ( 69.5% ) had clinical evidence of steal were evaluated by duplex ultrasound ( us ) .  
finding may be present , which warrants further investigation into the dynamics of flow and resistance in different av access conduits and their interplay with the underlying arterial pathology in the development of ischemic steal syndrome .
