we report 2 fatal mrsa cc398 infections after human - to - human transmission in institutional settings .
the sequence of events leaves no doubt that septicemia attributable to mrsa cc398 was the cause of death in both cases .
both patients had debilitating underlying diseases but were in a stable condition until the time of their infections .
the organism implicated in these 2 fatal cases was by all accounts spread from person to person .
the cc and spa types of the isolates causing fatal infections were typical for mrsa isolates from pigs .
these findings suggest that this clonal complex can be of high pathogenicity and is readily transmissible among humans .
transmission of mrsa cc398 in hospitals and institutions has been reported elsewhere , which underscores its potential to spread through person - to - person contact ( 911 ) . in conclusion ,
phylogeny of methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) clonal complex ( cc ) 398 isolates linked to fatal septicemia in a hospital patient and a nursing home resident in denmark .
phylogenetic analyses of whole - genome sequences indicated that the human isolates from the 2 transmission chains were located in different clusters that intermingled with isolates from pigs .
