should be adjusted to reflect these measures . in this study , we focus on imo and uscg proposed phase 1 standards ( hereafter  imo standard  ) and organisms of 50 m minimum dimension ( hereafter  zooplankton  ) to ( 1 ) characterize the uncertainty associated with estimating the concentration of organisms in bw due to the stochastic nature of sampling bw ( i.e. , sampling error ) ; and ( 2 ) demonstrate , using specific examples , how various regulatory decisions regarding rates of both type i ( i.e. , false positive ) and type ii ( i.e. , false negative ) errors(17 ) affect the sample volumes needed to verify organism concentrations . in particular , we estimate the statistical power to detect bw concentrations that exceed the current imo standard of < 10 organismsm using different sample volumes and regulatory scenarios .
the sampling and analysis of bw are prone to the same kinds of error ( see supporting information for detailed summary of sampling and recovery errors associated with bw discharge analyses ) . in the absence of standardized sampling and analytical protocols , currently available data are insufficient to create a comprehensive model that quantifies all sources of uncertainty for bw discharge analysis , as has been possible for drinking water . although we are not yet able to parameterize all potential sources of error , we present a theoretical model that is designed specifically to ascertain the baseline sample volumes required to robustly discern noncompliant zooplankton concentrations under ideal sampling and detection conditions , thereby establishing a rigorous lower limit ( or minimum threshold ) for sampling effort .
