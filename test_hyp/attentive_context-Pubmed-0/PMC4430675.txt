, we aimed to investigate the influence of obesity on the association between epicardial fat thickness ( eft ) and circadian bp changes in patients with recently diagnosed essential hypertension ( eh ) , with a gender subgroup analysis .
bp variability was associated with sbp and eft only in female patients ; therefore , eft may be a more valuable parameter in the evaluation of bp severity and obesity in women than in men .
this cross - sectional observational single - center cohort study included patients who underwent 24 h abpm and echocardiography between january 2008 and october 2013 .
, p = 0.937 ) . when we compared the 24-hour abmp parameters and eft between male and female patients , female patients had significantly higher eft ( 7.0  2.6 versus 5.9  2.2  mm , p < 0.001 ) and a greater daytime bp variation ( 15.1  4.72 versus 13.6  4.45  mmhg , p < 0.001 ) than male subjects
when we investigated the association of quotient of eft / bmi with bp values , eft / bmi showed positive correlation with 24-hour systolic bp ( r = 0.172 ; p = 0.009 ) , 24-hour mean bp ( r = 0.134 ; p = 0.041 ) , day systolic bp ( r = 0.150 ; p = 0.022 ) , day systolic bp variation ( r = 0.133 ; p = 0.043 ) , night systolic bp ( r = 0.217 ; p = 0.001 ) , night systolic bp variation ( r = 0.181 ; p = 0.006 ) , night diastolic bp ( r = 0.132 ; p = 0.047 ) , and night diastolic bp variation ( r = 0.179 ; p = 0.007 ) .
