using the data from the three - month study , researchers found that intervention with the paro robotic pet seal provided a viable alternative for controlling symptoms of anxiety and depression in elderly patients with dementia , often in lieu of pharmacological modalities .
therefore , the primary purpose of this study was to rigorously assess the effectiveness of paro robotic pet therapy in treating dementia - related symptoms such as anxiety and depression .
oxygen saturation , pulse rate , gsv , raid , and csdd and medication use were all positively impacted in patients participating in the interventional group , indicating improvement in symptom control .
compared to the controlgroup , pulse oximetry and gsv were increased , while raid , csdd , pulse rate , pain medication , and behavior medication were significantly decreased in the treatment group .
the interventional group received treatment with the paro robotic pet three times a week for 20 minutes , and the control group received the standard of care , which includes music , physical activity , and mental stimulation in 20-minute segments .
the before and after outcome measures included : rating for anxiety in dementia ( raid ) , cornell scale for depression in dementia ( csdd ) , global deterioration scale ( gds ) , pulse rate , pulse oximetry , galvanic skin response ( gsr ) , and medication utilization .
