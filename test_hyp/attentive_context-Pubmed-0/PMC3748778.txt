this study has shown that ipecs based on cs and el could be exploited successfully for colon - targeted delivery of ibf in the treatment of ibds .
thus , this study was designed to investigate the formation of ipec between cs and el , to characterize the product formed , and to evaluate its performance as a matrix for controlled release of drugs , using ibuprofen ( ibf ) as a model .
the differences between the different ipecs that were observed during the swelling experiments as well as during the drug release studies show that drug release could be tuned based on the composition of the ipec , with cs  :  el ( 3  :  2 ) ipecs as the best formulation .
similar results of high ph sensitivity were observed in polycomplex systems made up of cs - pectin   and cs - dextran sulfate . in order to assess the potential of the ipecs to be used in matrix controlled drug delivery systems
a group of researchers evaluated the swelling behavior of polycomplex matrices made from cs and el 100 in simulated gastro - intestinal tract ( git ) and all systems used were stable in ph 1.2 ( 1  h ) and ph 6.8 ( 2  h ) . according to the specifications of degussa , the dissolution of el depends on the copolymer structure and is well regulated by the ratio between methyl methacrylate or ethyl acrylate and methacrylic acid .
