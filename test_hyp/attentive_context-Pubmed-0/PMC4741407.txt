the diagnostic success and ercp success rates for billroth ii gastroenterostomy with the duodenoscope without or with braun anastomosis were 86.7% ( 117/135 ) and 84.0% ( 21/25 ) , respectively . for patients who underwent total gastrectomy with roux - en - y reconstruction ,
the study group included 220 patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy ( 77 women and 143 men ; mean age , 72.2 y ; range , 11 to 93 y ) .
the overall enterography success rate was 90.5% ( 199/220 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 88.6% ( 195/220 ) . among patients who underwent billroth i gastroenterostomy and proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy , endoscopic success rate was 100% ( 42/42 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 100% ( 42/42 ) .
for billroth ii gastroenterostomy , the endoscopic success rates without or with braun anastomosis were 88.9% ( 120/135 ) and 88.0% ( 22/25 ) , respectively .
the endoscopic success rate was 62.5% ( 5/8 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 62.5% ( 5/8 ) .
procedure may improve the enterography success rate in patients with billroth ii and roux - en - y reconstruction postgastrectomy
