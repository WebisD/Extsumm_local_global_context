the purpose of our study was to compare two ppe ensembles used by volunteers with minimal prior training , and to evaluate the feasibility of fluorescent markers as an assessment tool for ppe effectiveness .
eight healthcare providers ( six registered nurses and two physicians ) volunteered for this preliminary study .
the concept could also be used for some pathogens with a significant respiratory mode of transmission , such as pandemic influenza and novel pathogenic corona viruses , which have a recommended contact component of ppe .
non - toxic and mixed with an appropriate carrier , these agents can potentially mimic the natural contamination which occurs with an infectious agent spread by contact route .
an unprecedented outbreak of ebola virus disease ( evd ) is occurring in west africa .
the contamination in the alternate ppe ensemble arm likely could have been prevented if a larger range of gown sizes was available .
the participants were randomized to one of two ppe ensembles that meet current ( as of 10/20/14 ) cdc recommendations for ppe .
clinical activities as part of the assessment process , as the contamination likely would not have occurred without the provider manipulating the mannequin to place the blood pressure cuff .
