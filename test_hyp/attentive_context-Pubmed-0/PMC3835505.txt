therefore , we sought to identify the risk factors and long - term hepatobiliary outcomes with respect to recurrent cholangitis , liver abscess , secondary biliary cirrhosis , and cholangiocarcinoma , in patients with hepatolithiasis after treatment .
univariate analysis showed that the presences of bile duct stricture and residual stones were significant predictors of hepatobiliary complications ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.009 , respectively ) .
multivariate analysis included age , sex , the presence of a residual stone , the presence of bile duct stricture , and treatment method . age ( hr , 1.046 ; ci , 1.006 - 1.089 ) , bile duct stricture ( hr , 4.894 ; ci , 1.295 - 18.495 ) , and residual stone ( hr , 3.482 ; ci , 1.214 - 9.981 ) were found to be independently correlated with the risk of developing a hepatobiliary complication ( table 4 ) .
therefore , close observation is required especially in hepatolithiasis concomitant with bile duct stricture or residual stones , and in the elderly , even after constructive treatment .
there were 21 men and 64 women , whose ages ranged from 37 to 83 yr ( mean , 59.4 yr ) . of the patients , 65 were surgically treated and 20 underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy ( ptcsl ) .
