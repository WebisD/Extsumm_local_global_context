our partial survey of influenza virus distributions across the rich avifaunas of the southern region of china demonstrated frequent infections .
we have taken a step toward a more complete understanding of influenza virus ecology among wild birds .
an important part of the argument centers on the question of the occurrence of the virus in wild birds without obvious illness , which can be difficult to interpret given the low prevalence of influenza .
our study , although not successful in characterizing influenza viruses to specific strains , nonetheless shows that influenza a virus infection occurs in more bird species than previously assumed and that influenza a infections can be found in birds that behave normally and show no sign of illness .
the subtype h5n1 strain of influenza virus has spread rapidly and has been detected across much of central and southern eurasia . although movements of wild birds have been implicated in this spread ( 8) , other studies question ( 9,10 ) or contradict ( 11 ) this idea .
an obvious question is whether the influenza a viruses we detected belong to the highly pathogenic subtype h5n1 strain currently circulating across much of asia .
