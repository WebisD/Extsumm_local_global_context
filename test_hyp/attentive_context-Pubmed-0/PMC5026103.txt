there was no significant difference in increase of root canal surface area and canal transportation between the continuous rotary and reciprocating rotary techniques in all the three groups .
increase in root canal surface area was significantly more in protaper universal and k3xf groups when compared to lsx group .
uniformity in the increase of root canal surface area was better in lsx rotary system when compared to protaper universal and k3xf rotary systems .
canal transportation was significantly more in protaper universal group when compared to k3xf and lsx groups .
the present study included teeth with moderate root canal curvatures ( between 20 and 30 ) as most of the mesiobuccal and mesiolingual root canals of mandibular molars were found to have moderate curvatures . in the present study ,
lsx rotary system showed minimal canal transportation when compared to protaper universal and k3xf rotary systems .
limitations of the present study include only teeth with moderate root canal curvatures were included and usage of manual method to measure the root canal surface area by counting the number of pixels using adobe photoshop software .
cone beam computed tomography ( cbct ) is a recent advancement with advantages of image accuracy , acquisition of images in three planes ( coronal , sagittal and axial ) and reduced image artifacts .
