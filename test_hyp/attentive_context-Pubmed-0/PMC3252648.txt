one alternative to avoid this route of transmission is to equip doors with a foot - operated door opener rather than with a door handle .
the increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance is a serious problem , increasing both in severity and importance .
a device for opening the door with the foot was fitted flush into the door leaf . a pedal ( figure 1 ( fig .
with the foot - operated door opener described here instead of the traditional manually operated door handle , it is possible to open doors with a foot pedal . contamination of door handles with pathogens is thus avoided .
hospital staff , visitors , cleaning services and others are a potential source of contamination for door handles . in particular , the nursing staff  with a hand - disinfection rate of under 50% ,    can spread pathogens , as can other employees , 4.6% of whom have been found to be colonized with mrsa .
surfaces in patients surroundings , including the door knob or handle , are a relevant transmission route for viruses and microorganisms , , , .
therefore , it is necessary to find means of limiting or even preventing the transmission of pathogens within medical facilities .
