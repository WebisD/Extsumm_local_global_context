poor transition of patient care from the operating room has a high potential for adverse patient outcomes .
this pilot study was a qualitative rather than quantitative survey to highlight the scope of the current problem of us intraoperative handover of patient information .
an e - mail with a link to the questionnaire was sent to anesthesia providers at all anesthesia residency programs nationwide ( 120 out the 132 us programs encompassing around 4500 residents and their attending academic mdas ) and a smaller survey selection of crnas ( 10 institutions about 300 crnas in the metropolitan area of detroit , mi ) .
the response rate to this survey was low with a response from approximately 5% of the resident population in us anesthesia programs and approximately 20% of the crnas surveyed in the metropolitan detroit area .
