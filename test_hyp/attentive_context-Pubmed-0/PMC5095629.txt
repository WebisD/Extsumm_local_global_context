these results suggest that repeated administration of a multi - strain bp might reduce the risk of sara in cattle and that 
 consecutive treatment with 20 or 50 g of a bp containing lab during high - concentrate feeding might reduce the incidence of sara in dairy cattle .
( 2002 )   reported that a bp containing both lactate - consuming 
 ( propionibacterium ) and lactate - producing ( enterococcus ) bacteria activated ruminal fermentation and reduced the risk of 
 acidosis in cattle . in another study , a bp consisting of l. plantarum and e. faecium induced changes in the ruminal ph of cows 
 fed a high - grain diet .
we used the same bp in a 
 previous study on weaned calves fed a high - concentrate diet , and the mean ruminal ph was significantly higher in the treatment group compared with in the control 
 group . in this study , different doses of a multi - strain bp were administered to sara - challenged cows , and the 24-hr 
 mean ruminal ph was notably higher on days 3 to 7 , whereas the minimum ph increased on day 7 in the treatment groups .
sara is diagnosed when the ph in the ruminal fluid is < 5.6 for at least 3 hr 
 per day   . in this study ,
