, cinacalcet was found to be effective for the reduction and long - term maintenance of ipth , calcium and phosphorus levels in patients with shpt .
calcimimetics provide an alternative approach to the traditional therapy with active vitamin d and phosphate binders for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism ( shpt ) . type ii calcimimetics are positive allosteric modulators of the parathyroid gland calcium - sensing receptor ( car ) that increase its sensitivity to serum calcium , so that lower concentrations of calcium are sufficient to mediate signalling through the car .
these studies raise the possibility that treatment with calcimimetics might improve the sensitivity of the parathyroid glands to calcitriol and vitamin d analogues , allowing reduced doses to be used and thus minimizing the risk of hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia .
in addition to being effective in patients with mild to moderate disease , calcimimetics may be the most viable option for chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) patients with advanced hyperparathyroidism , who are often refractory to standard calcitriol therapy   .
in addition , calcimimetics have the potential to influence both car expression and car functions that have been implicated in the progression of disease , particularly effects on parathyroid hormone ( pth ) , cell proliferation and hyperplasia .
