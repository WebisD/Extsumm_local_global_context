the purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the effectiveness of endolaser photocoagulation by a two - port pars plana nonvitrectomy approach for treating coats disease with moderate - to - severe serous retinal detachment .
endolaser photocoagulation by two - port pars plana nonvitrectomy is a safe and effective approach in treating advanced coats disease with serous retinal detachment
medical records of 24 patients ( 25 eyes ) with stage 3 coats disease diagnosed from december 2012 to may 2014 at a single center were reviewed .
the average sessions to full treatment of active telangiectasia and retinal reattachment was 4  months ( range , 110  months ) ; only one ( 4.17  % ) eye progressed to retinal detachment due to lack of follow - up .
at the end of the follow - up period , 24 ( 96  % ) eyes had the retina reattached , telangiectasias were resolved , and no severe complications occurred . in groups
group b ( 11 eyes ) was initiated with endolaser treatment regimen due to the presence of serous retinal detachment .
only one eye developed vitreoretinal fibrosis 4  months after anti - vegf injection , which was in group c and the fibrosis might be connected with the serious disease or the treatments received .
