in this study we prepared porous foam like scaffolds with average pore size of 140 m , which could support cell penetration , migration , tissue in - growth and vascularisation as reported in the literature2526 and the average porosity of the scaffold was 82 per cent , which was in the range of the porosity of the trabecular bone ( 50 - 90% ) .
the in vitro biocompatibility study of the scaffolds showed that the polycaprolactone did not affect attachment , proliferation and differentiation on the scaffolds . the 25cht / hap / pcl composite scaffold possessed the inherent physiochemical and efficient mechanical and biocompatible characteristics .
the degradation rate of 100cht and 40cht / hap scaffold was high compared to the composite scaffolds , 30cht / hap / pcl and 25cht / hap / pcl .
the 25cht / hap / pcl biocomposite appears to be potential scaffolds as an off the shelf , synthetic , resorbable bone graft substitute for bone regeneration .
in contrast , the composite 30cht / hap / pcl and 25cht / hap / pcl scaffolds retained their original shape , despite evidence of degradation from weight loss measurements .
further addition of pcl ( 10% ) to the 40cht / hap showed no significant difference in the compressive strength and modulus of the 30cht / hap / pcl composite scaffold . increasing the pcl content to 15 per cent dramatically increased the compressive strength ( p<0.01 ) and compressive modulus ( p<0.001 ) of 25cht / hap / pcl composite scaffold .
