these viruses infect a variety of species , including aquatic birds , poultry , pigs , horses , dogs , and humans , causing significant morbidity and mortality . in the case of human influenza viruses , in addition to the burden of yearly epidemics , there is the ever - present threat of an influenza pandemic .
critical to this issue is the question of what makes an influenza virus transmissible in humans and animals .
although there are vaccines available for certain influenza viruses , they are strain specific , and the generation and general distribution of a new influenza virus vaccine take more time than the spread of a new virus , severely limiting the impact of vaccines in the first wave of a pandemic .
influenza antiviral drugs are of broader specificity , but resistance to those drugs and problems with availability limit their use . in order to mitigate the possible impact of an influenza pandemic , we need more research and development in the generation of improved vaccines and antivirals with broad cross - reactivity against multiple influenza viruses . in addition , by investigating the factors responsible for the generation of human pandemic viruses , we can better recognize the risks that animal influenza virus strains pose to humans and build eradication campaigns to target specific viral strains circulating in animals .
