ptx - loaded peg5k - fts4 led to an improved 
 tumor growth inhibitory effect in comparison to ptx formulated in 
 peg2k - fts2 , peg2k - fts4 , and peg5k - fts2 as well as taxol in a syngeneic 
 mouse model of breast cancer ( 4t1.2 ) .
four peg - fts conjugates that vary in the molecular weight of peg ( peg2k vs peg5k ) and the molar ratio of peg / fts ( 1/2 
 vs 1/4 ) have been developed .
recent 
 studies from us and others have shown that the vitamin e - based 
 micellar system could be significantly improved via modulating the 
 peg motifs and the molar ratio of peg / vitamin e. in another 
 study with peg - embelin system , we showed that a conjugate with two 
 embelin molecules linked to peg was significantly more effective than 
 the conjugate with one embelin molecule coupled to peg .
we 
 have systematically compared the physicochemical property and 
 the in vitro and in vivo ptx delivery 
 efficiency of four peg - fts conjugates that vary in the length of peg 
 motif ( peg2k vs peg5k ) and the molar ratio of 
 peg / fts ( 1/2 vs 1/4 ) .
