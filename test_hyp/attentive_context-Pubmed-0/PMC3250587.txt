we report the first case of a venous hemangioma of the pps and discuss its typical radiographic findings .
a 49-year - old female patient was referred for evaluation of swelling in the right submandibular region .
it may be that multiple , spotty , calcific nodules , 13 mm in size , within a cystic lesion on ct images indicate the pathognomonic finding of hemangioma in the pps .
clinical examination revealed a soft mass in the right submandibular region and a bulge at the right lateral pharyngeal wall . a contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) scan revealed a cystic lesion , 4.63.0 cm , with contrast non - enhancement in the parapharyngeal space ( pps ) .
the cystic lesion of the pps was surgically removed using a transcervical approach . during surgery
hemangiomas are categorized as racemose , capillary , cavernous , and venous , according to the size of their vascular spaces .
postoperative recovery was uneventful , and there has been no evidence of cranial nerve palsy or tumor recurrence after one year .
feeding vessel ligation , embolization , and fibrosing agents can be considered as alternatives ( 8) . in summary , we present the first reported case of venous hemangioma occurring in the parapharyngeal space . considering that a presumptive diagnosis of most pps tumors can be made based on imaging studies , preoperative imaging findings are very important in approaching these lesions .
