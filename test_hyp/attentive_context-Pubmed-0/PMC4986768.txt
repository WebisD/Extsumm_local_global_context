abnormal cytosolic localization of 2-spectrin in knockout single fibers extends our previous work showing that loss of tmod1 leads to disruptions in the lens fiber membrane skeleton by providing a molecular mechanism connecting the f - actin cytoskeleton to fiber cell morphology .
we have developed a novel technique to immunostain single lens fiber cells while preserving their complex morphology ; this new method has allowed us to conduct detailed investigations of the f - actin structures and abps required for the formation of the interdigitations at fiber cell vertices .
thus , this work reveals specific abps required for the formation of large paddles between lens fibers , and suggests that large paddles between mature fiber cells are needed for lens mechanical integrity .
unlike loss of tmod1 alone , which leads to selective reduction of large paddle domains , we showed previously that combined loss of tmod1 and cp49 , a beaded intermediate filament protein , leads to reduction in small protrusions at the vertices of mature fiber cells , suggesting that both actin and intermediate filaments are needed for normal formation or stabilization of these smaller interdigitations .
the ability to immunostain and visualize individual mature lens fiber cells provides an opportunity to investigate the actin cytoskeleton composition of protrusions versus paddles , and how loss of tmod1 and perturbations of actin - associated proteins could account for defective paddles but not small protrusions in tmod1 mature fiber cells .
