relative to the baseline and post  amino acid measurements , there was a mean rise of 10.0 mmhg ( 95% ci 2.317.9 ; p = 0.017 ) and 7.3 mmhg ( 1.013.7 ; p = 0.03 ) , respectively , in the african - heritage group and 4.3 mmhg ( 1.8 to 10.4 ; p = 0.23 ) and 2.4 mmhg ( 3.5 to 8.3 ; p = 0.38 ) in the caucasian - heritage group .
in this study , patients without hypertension or renal disease of african heritage had an increased sensitivity to the renal vasoconstrictive effect of no synthase ( nos ) inhibition .
although consistent with experimental studies , these outcomes require caution before being generalized . confirmatory studies in patients with and without diabetes with greater power and the evaluation of the role of vasoconstrictive cytokines , angiotensin
final blood pressure was higher in the african - heritage group ( 137.5  9.0 vs. 123.4  14.2 mmhg ; p < 0.05 ) and was associated with a fall in rbf ( 46.0 ml / min per 1.73 m ; p < 0.05 ) and a rise in rvr ( from 0.12  0.06 to 0.14  0.04 mmhg ml / min per 1.73 m ; p = 0.036 ) .
