for this reason , frequent and regular field work is required , with accurate data particularly of the macro and micro habitats where ant species are thriving , if we are to understand ant ecology in morocco .
the ant fauna of morocco is particularly diverse with 233 species , when compared to only 180 species in both algeria and tunisia ( cagniant 2006 ) , but it remains less than the recorded 295 species in the iberian peninsula ( roig and espadaler 2010 ) .
we sampled ants in three regions of morocco : first in the north - west , in the region of tangiers - tetouan where we focused on several areas : ( 1 ) mediona and cap spartel within the province of tangiers , ( 2 ) al hamra and balota within the province of tetouan , and ( 3 ) dardara , fifi , talassemtane national park , and bouhachem natural park within the province of chefchaouen .
the rate at which ant species are added to the list of the moroccan fauna would suggest that there remain more to be discovered .
we can now confirm the widespread presence of this species in rabat and temara ( especially in public gardens ) .
