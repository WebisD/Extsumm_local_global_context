four of the eight correlations between the sis subscales and the bi exceeded the criterion of .35 , namely home living ( -.78 ) , community living ( -.41 ) , health and safety ( -.41 ) and medical ( -.70 ) .

the present research was the first attempt to measure the psychometric properties of the sis in people with physical disabilities .
in addition , the correlations between the bi and community living and health and safety exceeded the minimum criterion .35 .
