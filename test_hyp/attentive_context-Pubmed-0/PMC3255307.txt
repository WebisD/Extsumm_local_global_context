given the greater resolution a number of characteristic changes seen in retinal detachment have been observed . in this paper , we discuss two cases where spectral domain oct and an understanding of the histological changes have enabled a clearer diagnosis and planning of treatment .
our first case is a seventy - five - year - old gentleman who presented with a vague history of blurred vision for six weeks .
high - speed spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( oct ) offers a noninvasive tool to evaluate retinal microstructural changes in a number of eye pathologies .
it is important to be able to assess the retinal detachment and to ascertain the urgency of planning surgical intervention .
changes seen in the oct scan were characteristic of an old retinal detachment with the presence of intraretinal cysts , undulation of outer retinal layers , and the hyper - reflectivity in the photoreceptor layer ( figure 2 ) .
conversely , the lack of subfoveal morphological changes in our second case led to the conclusion that the detachment was recent and prognosis good , thus surgery was expedited .
however , studies have shown that surgery is best done during normal working hours . given the pressures on theatre use
