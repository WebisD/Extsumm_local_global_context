our findings showed an association between type i psoriasis and 10 snps ( n = 155 versus n = 197 controls ) : rs1634517 ( ccl4l ) , rs1975974 ( c17orf51 ) , rs12720356 ( tyk2 ) , rs1800925 ( il13 ) , and rs6908425 ( cdkal1 ) decreased the risk of psoriasis 2.94-fold , 2.08-fold , 10-fold , 100-fold , and 2.44-fold , respectively ; and rs2282276 ( clmn ) , rs10782001 ( fbxl19 ) , rs3792876 ( slc22a4 ) , rs12191877 ( hla - c ) , and rs13437088 ( hla - b / mica ) increased the risk of psoriasis 3.90-fold , 2.10-fold , 3.75-fold , 30.54-fold , and 2.52-fold , respectively ( table 2 ) .
in addition , psors6 and tnf have been described as more prevalent genes in type i psoriasis and we showed a significant association when we compared type i psoriasis and type ii psoriasis .
four snps were associated with significant decreases in the risk of type i psoriasis ( n = 155 ) compared with type ii psoriasis ( n = 36 ) , namely , rs191190 ( tnfr1 ; 126.08-fold ) , rs361525 ( tnf- ; 190.76-fold ) , and rs10499194 and rs6920220 ( tnfaip3 ; 155.02-fold and 19.14-fold , resp . ) .
