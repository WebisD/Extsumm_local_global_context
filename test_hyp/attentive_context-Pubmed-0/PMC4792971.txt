we investigated factors affecting 
 handwriting articulation of children with cerebral palsy based on the icf model to provide 
 comprehensive data for the assessment and design of interventions for effective handwriting 
 of children with cerebral palsy .
efforts to manage and improve the handwriting 
 articulation of children with cerebral palsy should focus on wrist lateral deviation and 
 upper - extremity speed .
some personal factors ( age , education ) and body functions ( cognitive function : visual 
 perception , visuomotor organization ; strength function : upper extremity elbow flexion and 
 extension , wrist extension , lateral deviation and medial deviation , grasp ; and motor 
 function : bilateral coordination , upper - extremity speed , factors were related to handwriting 
 articulation . according to the backward regression analysis , wrist lateral deviation , 
 upper - extremity speed and education were significantly associated with handwriting 
 articulation ( table 3table 3.factors related to handwriting articulationcomponent of icfhandwriting factorsunstandardized coefficientsstandardized coefficientsvifbstandard errorbetabody functionstrength functionupper extremity - wrist lateral deviation1.0460.2990.3071.001*motor functionupper extremity speed0.0790.0180.3931.024**personal factoreducation0.3640.1760.1831.023**p<0.05 , * * p<0.001 ) .
based on the icf , factors related to handwriting were classified as personal factors 
 ( gender , age , education , hand dominance , type of cerebral palsy ) , environmental factors 
 ( writing aids , sitting aids , type of desk ) , body structure(affected side ) , body functions 
 ( cognitive function : orientation , visual perception , spatial perception , motor praxis , 
 visuomotor organization , thinking operation ; sensory function : proprioception , tactile ; 
 strength function : upper extremity , grasp , prehension ; motor function : bilateral 
 coordination , upper extremity speed ) , and activity and participation ( sitting balance , 
 pencil grasp posture ) . to identify the factors related to handwriting articulation ,
