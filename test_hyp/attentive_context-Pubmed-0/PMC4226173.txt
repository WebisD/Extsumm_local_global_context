there were no significant differences between two groups ( mgso4 group and celecoxib group ) in frequency of history of preterm labor ( p = 1 ) , frequencies of nulliparity ( p = 0.99 ) , duration of drug use and arrest contraction ( p = 0.29 ) , delivery before 48 hours ( p = 0.20 ) , and mean gestational age in lack of response to treatment ( p = 0.24 ) ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
there was significant association between two groups ( mgso4 group and celecoxib group ) in frequency of effacement ( p < 0.0001 ) , gestational age ( p
frequencies of gestational age at time of delivery in all subjects were 31.74  1.86 weeks and in mgso4 group and celecoxib group were 32.1  1.82 and 31.38  1.83 weeks , respectively .
there were not any significant differences between cervical dilatation in two groups , but from the beginning , cervical effacement showed a significant difference between two groups ; we found that although celecoxib group already had more cervical effacement , celecoxib effectiveness was as the same as mgso4 group . in this study ,
no need for closes monitoring of the patients , and there are not invasive procedures such as injections and same effect of mgso4 .
