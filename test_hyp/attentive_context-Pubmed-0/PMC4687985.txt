the objective of this research was to assess the effect of continuous and intermittent electrical stimulation on the pain perception in patients with different types of burns .
after the intervention a statistically significant reduction in pain perception ( p=0.027 ; 8.01.7 vs 1.00.5 ) was observed ( table 2 ) .
however , a controlled clinical trial with a bigger sample size and the use of a stratified analysis according to the different etiologies of burns is needed .
the nurse team reported a long time analgesic effect on patients after the electrical intervention , but we could not measure this observation effectively .
the length of hospital stay was variable for each patient , being longer for patients who had burns with greater thickness .
electrical stimulation could be a potential nonpharmacological therapeutic option for pain management in burn patients .
a pilot study was conducted in 14 adults ( 1860 years of age ) , with similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics who had second- and/or third - degree burns of different types according to american burn association .
the symmetrical biphasic ( faradic)-pulsed currents applied continuously and interruptedly in the same session could generate analgesia and promote healing , respectively .
