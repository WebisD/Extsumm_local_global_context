a recent report states a goal for the community is to transition from traditional database management to managing potentially unstructured data across many repositories.1 
  we propose the key challenges for intelligently linking prior knowledge to partially automate genomic interpretation require : ( a ) a fundamentally different computational framework for storing and representing disparate data types with complex relationships , and ( b ) advanced software applications that leverage this framework to structure the representation of prior knowledge so that it can be intelligently linked to patient data .
we propose a framework conceptually based on requirements and cognitive strategies for knowledge computing , previously introduced as the biointelligence framework.2 
  our framework is compatible with future directions toward computational intelligence .
the next great challenge will be to address the manual interpretation bottleneck through the development of computational solutions for intelligently linking complex patient data to actionable biomedical knowledge .
since it can support the capturing and querying of multilateral and multi - scalar relations among genomes , phenotype , environment , lifestyle , medical history , and clinical outcome data , our platform can support systems with higher order functions such as inference and learning .
this data - intensive approach is providing unprecedented insights that can be used to resolve mechanistic complexity and clinical heterogeneity , thereby revolutionizing how we study , manage , and treat complex diseases . to support this revolution
