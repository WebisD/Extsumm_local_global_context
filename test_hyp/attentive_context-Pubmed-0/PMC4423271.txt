the aim of this study is to describe a ase of a nf2-deafened - patient who underwent to vestibular schwannoma resection via retrolabyrinthine approach , with cochlear nerve preservation and cochlear implantation through the round window , at the same surgical time .
neurofibromatosis type 2 ( nf2 ) is an autosomal dominant disease consequent to mutation of both alleles of a suppressor tumor gene in the long arm of chromosome 221 
 2 .
cochlear implantation is a feasible auditory restoration option in nf2 when cochlear anatomic and functional nerve preservation is achieved .
auditory brainstem implant ( abi ) has been the standard surgical treatment for these patients , to recover some degree of auditory capability and to enhance lip reading . in the 1990s , the promising idea of using a cochlear implant for auditory restoration became feasible .
a 36-year - old woman with nf2 presented with a complaint of bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss for 10 years , which was similar in both ears . in 2009
the first attempt at auditory restoration in a patient with nf2 and profound hearing loss was conducted by house and hitselberger in 19793 .
the rla approach was adequate for this purpose and presents an option for hearing preservation in nf2 patients .
