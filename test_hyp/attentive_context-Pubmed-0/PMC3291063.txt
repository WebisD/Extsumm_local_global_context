our data show that the recently identified bovine h - type isolates involve an infectious agent that can induce development of a disease across a species barrier , while maintaining the specific associated prp molecular signature .
this evidence in favor of a new bovine prion strain in cattle suggests that bse is not the only transmissible prion disease in cattle .
however , based on analysis of molecular features of prion diseases in cattle , this situation is similar to that in humans ( 5 ) , in which different subtypes of sporadic creutzfeldt - jakob disease agents are found .
these cases suggest either the existence of alternative origins of such diseases in cattle or phenotypic changes of prp after infection with the bse agent .
this finding is in contrast to the result obtained with monoclonal antibody sha31 directed against an epitope in the central region of the protein , which showed that the 12b2 epitope was preserved in h - type  infected mice .
experimental groups of 20 ( 4- to 6-week old ) c57bl/6 female mice ( charles river , l'arbresle , france ) were injected intracerebrally with 20 l of 10% ( weight / volume ) homogenates per mouse prepared from brain stem samples of 3 cattle tse isolates .
