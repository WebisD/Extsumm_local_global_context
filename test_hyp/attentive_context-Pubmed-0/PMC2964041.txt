the research presented here demonstrates that neural networks can be used to successfully characterize the binding affinities of proteinligand complexes .
, one strength of the neural - network scoring function is that it is largely orthogonal to other kinds of functions based on force fields , linear regression , and statistical analyses .
herein , we describe a fast and accurate neural - network - based scoring function that can be used to rescore the docked poses of candidate ligands .
however , the use of neural networks in this context is largely unprecedented.(21 ) although useful in its own right , the neural - network approach to affinity prediction is also orthogonal to existing physics - based and statistics - based scoring functions and , so , might prove useful in consensus - scoring projects as well .
although any computational model pales in comparison to the complexity of the brain , the mind s ability to categorize proteinligand complexes nevertheless suggests that a neural network , a computer model designed to mimic the microscopic organization of the brain , might be at least as suited to the prediction of proteinligand binding affinities as equation- and statistics - based scoring functions .
