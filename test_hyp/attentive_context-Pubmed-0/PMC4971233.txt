the high - definition video obtained from these expeditions enabled in situ observations of host - parasite interactions while providing unparalleled , high - resolution images of ectoparasites infecting fishes in the deep sea .
visual observations from rov surveys were used in the present study to identify ectoparasites and their hosts and examine whether ectoparasite diversity declines with increasing depth .
we also examined whether ectoparasite - host interactions and intensity of infections differ among depths and habitats in each of three common fish species [ antimora rostrata ( family moridae ) , nezumia bairdii ( family macrouridae ) , and synaphobranchus ( family synaphobranchidae ) ] .
by demonstrating the widespread occurrence of ectoparasitism in the deep sea using visual based surveys , we hope that this study can serve as a basis for testing further hypotheses regarding the role of parasitism throughout the deep sea .
thus , the value of visual analysis in parasite studies , from shallow waters to the deep - sea , is clear .
although our estimates of ectoparasite diversity are conservative , as species can not be identified without collections , our study demonstrates the utility of using an rov to observe and count ectoparasite - host interactions across a variety of depths , habitats , and host species , while providing the opportunity to examine in situ the impact of ectoparasite infections on fish behavior .
