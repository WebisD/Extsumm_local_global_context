we herein report a patient with ivl who presented with fever of unknown origin ( fuo ) and in whom a brain mass developed , mimicking pcnsl .
intravascular lymphomatosis ( ivl ) is an uncommon systemic disease in which malignant proliferation of lymphocytes occurs exclusively in the vessels .
a 75-year - old right - handed female patient was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of recurrent fevers .
a unique characteristic of this disorder is that the proliferation of malignant lymphocytes occurs only within the vessels , in contrast to primary central nervous system lymphoma ( pcnsl ) .
mri showed a brain mass mimicking pcnsl ; however , a random skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ivl .
ivl is an uncommon systemic disease in which malignant proliferation of lymphocytes occurs exclusively in vessels .
although postmortem examination was not performed , the brain mass noted on mri was considered to be a collection of malignant lymphomatous cells invading from the vessels .
the clinical symptoms are nonspecific in most cases , making an early diagnosis difficult   .
studied 10 cases of ivl in a single institution and reported that fuo and a mental status change were the most common signs , being present in 60% of cases .
