; this study determined the lipid profile of adult nigerians with sca in vaso - occlusive crisis ( voc ) and in steady state ( ssca ) .
pcv , tc , hdl and ldl were significantly lower while wbc was significantly higher in sca compared with the control subjects .
eighty - two participants comprising 58 adults with sca ( 30 in steady state and 28 in voc ) and 24 age - matched healthy individuals with hbaa genotype were recruited into this study .
there was insignificant reduction in the levels of tc , tg , ldl , tg / hdl and insignificant elevation of hdl level in sca subjects with > 11.97 ( 10/l ) wbc compared with sca subjects with 11.97 ( 10/l )   lipid profile in ssca , voc and control subjects pattern of lipid profile based on mean total white blood cell count ( wbc ) in sca subjects
similarly , tc and ldl were significantly lower in sca subjects in vaso - occlusive crisis ( voc ) compared with controls . however , tc , tg , ldl and tg / hdl were significantly lower while hdl was significantly higher in voc compared with ssca .
