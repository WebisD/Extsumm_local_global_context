opalescence xtra ( ox ) increased fluoride release from conventional and resin - modified glass ionomers in the first week while the effect faded by time .
opalescence quick ( oq ) had no significant effect on the fluoride release of the three materials .
each group was further subdivided into three sub - groups , 10 samples for each group .
time had highly significant effect on fluoride released from all glass ionomer materials under test at p < 0.05 [ table 1 ] . ketac fil showed initial burst in fluoride release in the first week ( t1 ) of 58.6 ppm , then concentration of fluoride decreased sharply after 1 month ( t2 ) of 10.94 ppm .
the first sub group was a control group , the second sub group was bleached with opalescence xtra ( ox ) , and the last one was bleached with opalescence quick ( oq ) .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vital bleaching on the fluoride release of various types of glass ionomer restorations . also , to compare the fluoride release of various types of glass ionomer restorations .
a significant increase in the mean fluoride released from ketac fil bleached with opalescence xtra compared to the untreated control group and the group bleached with opalescence quick . for photac fil ,
