the laboratory data showed a significant increase in k , alt , ast , total bilirubin ( tbil ) , direct bilitubin ( dbil ) , wbcs and inr with a significant decrease in na , alb and platelets in both patient groups as compared to the control group .
the specific objectives were to evaluate : 1 ) cardiac performance by echocardiography and electrocardiography , 2 ) systemic vascular resistance , and 3 ) fluid status in both patients groups and subsequently compare them to normal subjects and to each other .
there was significant decrease in both systolic & diastolic bp with increase in pulse rate in both patient groups ( groups 1 and 2 ) as compared to the control group ( p<0.01 ) .
patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis have lv diastolic dysfunction and prolonged qt interval in the ecg with preserved systolic function .
the echocardiographic data showed a statistically significant increase in la , ao , ivst , pwt , edd ( p<0.01 ) , esd and lv mass in both patient groups as compared to the control group and a statistically significant decrease in early to late diastolic flow ratio ( e / a ratio ) in both patient groups as compared to the control group . a significant increase in la and ao
