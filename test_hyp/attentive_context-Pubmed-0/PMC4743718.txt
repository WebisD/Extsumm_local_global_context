somehow , futile quarrels and surgical discrepancies are abundant , for example : should we do a hiatal hernia repair in the mean time as a sleeve gastrectomy ? should we only do the regular roux - en - y gastric bypass or can we afford the omega - loop bypass ? in the meantime , and paradoxically , bariatric surgery claims to expand its boundaries , for instance taking on class i obesity ( international federation for the surgery of obesity and metabolic disorders [ ifso ] statement , 2014 ) .
although expanding , the array of bariatric techniques does not meet the current needs of morbidly obese patients ( class ii to iii obesity ) .
one must advise caution and warn that re - do after endoscopic techniques might be more difficult than anticipated . keeping in mind a  bariatric schedule  and the necessity of experimenting with combinations , we assume that one success among some of the current devices that are being developed and tried could change our expectations , and attract investors .
if bariatric endoscopy may be viewed as a competitor to bariatric surgery , current trends suggest the development of combined strategies as well as mutual assistance when it comes to procedures that require both endoscopic and surgical skills .
