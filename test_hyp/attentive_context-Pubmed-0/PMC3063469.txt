the purpose of this review is to address a number of counseling strategies used for education and counseling of individuals at risk of getting hiv / aids .
there are several examples of one - on - one counseling methods used for risk reduction counseling among hiv positive individuals .
moreover , later in this paper are discussed some of the counseling strategies used in individuals already diagnosed with hiv or aids and these strategies were used in preventing further transmission of the disease .
internet - based counseling has gained some popularity over recent years but has to deal with issues such as lack of visual and verbal cues , confidentiality , accessibility problems by those in great need and increased client separation.34 counseling related to using spiritual coping techniques have been well established in cancer literature but has limited evidence in hiv related counseling .
