results showed that tomato consumption (  = 5.79 , 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 3.997.59 ; p < 0.0001 ) and days of adherence (  = 0.61 , 95% ci 0.12 - 1.11 ; p = 0.01 ) were independently and significantly associated with the increment in hdl - c levels ( f = 5.20 ; r = 0.83 ; r = 0.69 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
therefore , we performed a randomized , single - blinded , controlled clinical trial to specifically evaluate whether the consumption of two uncooked tomatoes per day ( 14 servings a week ) during 1 month could produce a favorable effect on hdl - c .
adherence correlated positively with the hdl - c increment in the tomato group ( r = 0.34 , p = 0.01 ) .
the mean adherence per month was 27.6  1.9 days and 27.5  2.0 days in the tomato and cucumber groups , respectively ( p = 0.90 ) .
we only identified a significantly higher consumption of omega-3 fatty acids in the tomato group ( p = 0.02 ) . during the study ,
the occidental diet is usually composed of high - glycemic - index and high - fat foods and has been associated with the development of chronic diseases , including cvds , cancer , and diabetes.27 in contrast , the consumption of tomato - based food sources along with fresh fruit , vegetables , and olive oil is common in a mediterranean dietary pattern and provides a variety of nutrients with potential cardiovascular benefits.28 however , investigation regarding the association between tomato - based food intake and cvd risk has demonstrated contradictory results .
