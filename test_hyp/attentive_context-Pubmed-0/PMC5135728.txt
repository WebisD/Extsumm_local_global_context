as can be seen , the expression of amacr decreased in metastatic prostate cancer ( p = 0.02 ) .
the expression of other genes showed no difference between metastatic and non - metastatic tumors ( p > 0.1 ) .
this study attempts to evaluate relationship between clinical parameters of prostate cancer ( psa , gleason sore , and metastase ) and expression of nkx3.1 , amacr , tmprss2- erg , erg , and spink1 genes .
no relationship was detected between the expression of the five genes and the gleason score ( p > 0.1 ) .
the psa levels were less than 10 ng / ml , 10 - 20 ng / ml and more than 20 ng / ml in 12 , 17 , 14 patients , respectively .
establishing a relationship between gene expression and clinical parameters ( psa , gleason score and clinical stage ) can help us in treatment planning
the challenge is to identify those patients at risk for relapse and to better understand the molecular abnormalities that define tumors at risk of relapse ( 2 ) .
a decrease in the expression of amacr may be a sign of poor prognosis and an increase in the risk of metastasis .
