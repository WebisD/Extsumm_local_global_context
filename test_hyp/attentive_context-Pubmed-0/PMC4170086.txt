paget 's disease ( pd ) of bone is a focal , progressive disorder of accelerated bone remodeling and can lead to bone pain and several complications , including deformities , fractures , and secondary osteoarthritis .
this case study demonstrated that a patient with pd who had been treated unsuccessfully with oral bisphosphonates was effectively treated with a 5 mg infusion of zoledronate .
bisphosphonates , which is the most potent anti - resorptive drug , have been the most effective agents available for the treatment of pd . among the bisphosphonates for osteoporosis treatment ,
zoledronate is a nitrogen - bound intravenous bisphosphonate with highest potency and longest administration interval .
the ability of zoledronate to provide a sustained remission offers many advantages for patients with pd and may lead to considerable benefits for the long term in preventing or minimizing complications .
we report a patient with pd of bone , resistant to pamidronate treatment in whom intravenous zoledronate produced clinical remission and an improvement in the bone scan during 3 years .
