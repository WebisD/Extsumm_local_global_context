presence of ms was significantly associated with a decreased risk of high - grade prostate cancer ( or , 0.101 ; p=0.004 ) ( table 3 ) .
prostate cancer patients diagnosed with ms had a mean gleason score of 6.631.92 , which is significantly lower than that of prostate cancer patients without ms ( 7.541.71 ; p=0.029 ) ( table 1 ) . both tpsa and dpsa were higher in patients with a high - grade gleason score than in those with a low - grade gleason score . in the logistic regression analysis ,
high tpsa and small prostate volume were significant predictors for prostate cancer diagnosis ( odds ratio [ or ] , 1.079 and 0.979 , respectively ) .
however , age , presence of ms , and bmi were not significantly related to increasing prostate cancer risk . in the logistic regression analysis ,
ninety patients ( 25.4% ) were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 75 patients ( 21.2% ) were diagnosed with ms according to the ncep - atp iii criteria .
furthermore , the presence of ms was significantly associated with a decreased risk of high - grade prostate cancer . a larger , prospective , multicenter investigation
