hence , the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of nc and nhtr as independent predictors of mets and its components among asian indians as compared to traditional anthropometric indices ( bmi , wc , and whtr ) .
our study demonstrated for the 1 time the reliability of nhtr as a predictor of mets and its components and highlighted that nhtr is perhaps an even better index than nc with regards to cardiovascular risk prediction .
area under the roc by different anthropometric indices as predictor of metabolic syndrome and cardio - metabolic risk factors ( n=451 ) a nc of > 34.9 cm ( sensitivity 78.6% ; specificity 59.3% ) for men and > 31.25 cm ( sensitivity 72.3% ; specificity 64.4% ) for women were the best values of combined sensitivity and specificity in identifying mets . a logistic regression analysis , using mets as the dependent variable , showed that the relationship between nc and mets after adjusting for sex and age was statistically significant ( odds ratio 1.52 [ 95% confidence interval [ ci ] : 1.371.68 ] ; p < 0.001 ) .
similarly a nhtr of > 21.17 cm / m ( sensitivity 80.7% and specificity 64.6% ) for men and > 20.48 cm / m ( sensitivity 80.4% and specificity 60% ) for women were the best values of combined sensitivity and specificity in identifying mets . a logistic regression analysis , using mets as the dependent variable , showed that the relationship between nhtr and mets after adjusting for sex and age was statistically significant ( odds ratio 1.96 [ 95% ci : 1.672.29 ] ; p < 0.001 ) .
