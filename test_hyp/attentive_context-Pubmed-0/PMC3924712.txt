, we report a case of water intoxication caused by excessive water drinking in a detention facility . in this case
, the secondary development of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of adh ( siadh ) contributed to the patient 's prolonged hyponatremia after discontinuation of the excessive water intake .
the latter situation results from an inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) to the plasma osmolality . in hypo - osmolar syndrome
water intoxication is a fatal disorder with brain function impairment , defined as hypo - osmolar syndrome resulting from an excess intake of water , with dilutional hyponatremia formed principally by ( 1 ) the retention of water exceeding renal free water excretion , or ( 2 ) impaired free water excretion from the kidneys .
a 22-year - old man who was an inmate in a detention facility joined a game of  rock / paper / scissors with his roommates at 8:00 p.m. they made a rule that the loser of each game must drink a cup of water as a penalty by using a plastic cup with a capacity of 300 ml .
the former situation is occasionally observed in psychiatric patients with polydipsia , or it may develop as a result of iatrogenic water overloading .
