the initial histopathologic grade of iii / iv , and involvement of orbita , brain , or bone marrow metastasis were the statistically significant poor prognostic factors , whereas age , sex , and treatment modality were not prognostic factors .
additional information regarding the clinical course and outcome was collected from the patients ' charts and phone calls to the patients , their relatives , and their general practitioners . in this study , we have reviewed 19 cases of olfactory neuroblastomas treated over 24-year period and analyzed the clinical features , treatment outcomes , and prognostic factors .
the reasons for that might be including low number of patients in the study , being 5 distant site metastasis , 4 cervical lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis , only one orbital exentration ( although there were 8 orbital involvement ) , and 12 patients exhibiting high grade histology and inability to evaluate surgical margins in resected tumors . in conclusion , advanced tumor stage ,
initial treatments included surgery alone in three patients , radiotherapy ( rt ) with or without ctx in five , surgery plus postoperative rt in seven and multimodality therapy ( surgery plus postoperative ctx plus postoperative rt ) in three , and finally ctx alone in one . in 14 patients ,
