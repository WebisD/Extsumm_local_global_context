this review therefore aims to serve as resource for health professionals to enhance their understanding of ototoxicity as well as their roles within an ototoxicity monitoring programme by providing an overview and description of this condition in patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving cisplatin chemotherapy .
the different molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cisplatin - associated ototoxicity highlight the complexity of this condition and the consequent difficulty in identifying an effective otoprotective agent .
the varying incidence rates reported in both adults and paediatrics may be due to the different audiological tests employed in the monitoring of the cancer patient 's hearing status and therefore highlight the importance of the use of extended high frequency audiometry and dpoaes in ototoxicity monitoring .
the review identified peer - reviewed articles available from january 1975 to july 2015 on the topic of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring and included english articles only .
an audiological monitoring programme comprising a team of health care professionals , knowledgeable about cisplatin ototoxicity , may therefore serve to improve evidence - based service delivery to these patients .
this is further supported by evidence from the south african study of khoza - shangase and jina   which indicated that most general practitioners sampled also do not appear to carry out ototoxicity monitoring strategies , despite being aware of their own role within an ototoxicity monitoring programme .
