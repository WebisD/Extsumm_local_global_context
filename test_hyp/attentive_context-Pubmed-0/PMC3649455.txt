eighteen months prior to presentation , she was diagnosed with a chlamydial infection by cervical culture and treated with a single dose azithromycin . a negative chlamydia culture was confirmed four months prior to presentation . as part of her initial infertility evaluation at our center
il-2 , t lymphocytes , cd3 + , cd8 + , cd4 + , alpha v beta 3 integrin , lif , mmps and hoxa10 have all been shown to be decreased in the endometrium from women with versus without hydrosalpinx(5 - 8 ) though molecular inflammatory changes in the setting of hydrosalpinx are documented , a hysteroscopic endometrial phenotype in the presence of hydrosalpinx has not been well characterized .
to date , such a hysteroscopic endometrial phenotype in the presence of hydrosalpinx has not been described .
the deleterious impact of hydrosalpinx on fertility is best exemplified by studies showing a 50% reduction in ivf pregnancy rates in their presence ( 1 ) .
chlamydia infection and pelvic inflammatory disease are associated with an increased risk of both tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy , with the association proportionate to the number of infections(2 ) .
multiple studies have demonstrated deficiency in endometrial markers of embryo receptivity in the presence of hydrosalpinx .
