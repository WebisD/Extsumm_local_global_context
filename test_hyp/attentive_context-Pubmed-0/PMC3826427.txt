diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) is a one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes . in 2012 , there are more than 371 million people suffering from diabetes , and it is being projected that the number of diabetic patients will reach 550 million in 2030 ( http://www.eatlas.idf.org/ ; assessed 29-nov-2012 ) .
we focus on the animal models of dr that researchers have used , briefly describe how the models were generated , highlight the morphological and functional changes in the retina , and finally discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model .
a number of animal models of dr have been described and compared , ranging from different species to different induction methods of diabetes or angiogenesis , together with their corresponding temporal morphological and functional lesions .
more importantly , the availability of a collection of transgenic and knockout mice allows researchers to study the role of particular genes , which may even be cell type specific , in the development and pathophysiological progression of dr .
up to date , there is no single model which can mimic the development of dr as in human , that is , from the very early cellular and vascular abnormalities to the proliferative stage , and subsequently retinal detachment , as a result of prolonged hyperglycemia .
