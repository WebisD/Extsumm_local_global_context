it is also the first to describe e. coli carriers in free - ranging parrots , and the results indicate that although the potential to develop disease was present , several factors that are most likely to be found in captivity needed to be involved in triggering disease development .
a large number of samples were positive for virulence factors commonly found in apec ( 14 samples ) , with most originating from blue - fronted amazon chicks .
the purpose of this study was to test cloacal samples from asymptomatic free - living nestlings ( blue - fronted amazon parrots as well as hyacinth and lear 's macaws ) to determine if they could be carriers of recognized e. coli pathotypes .
in addition , we discuss the role that these strains could play in both free - living and captive parrots .
this gene was also found associated with other virulence factors in 4 samples , all from blue - fronted amazon parrots .
other studies involving different species as well as a higher number of samples are important to further define the role and risks involved with specific e. coli pathotypes in the case of both wild and captive psittacines .
