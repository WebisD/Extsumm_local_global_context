it is clear from previous experiments that there are no bond formation and cleavage events occurring during catalysis ; therefore , we have used classical molecular mechanics coupled with the accelerated molecular dynamics methodology to shed some light on this very important catalytic mechanism . using the accelerated molecular dynamics method that allows us to overcome the submicrosecond time scale limitation of normal molecular dynamics simulations , we have studied the catalytic mechanism of cyclophilin in full - atomistic detail in explicit water . aside from a possible small electronic contribution that has not been captured by the classical mechanics empirical force field , we are able to fully describe the catalytic mechanism of cyclophilin and provide quantitative estimates of the free energies associated with the process .
cistrans isomerization of peptide  bonds of proteins is a very important switching mechanism in biology that is involved in many cell signaling pathways .
the catalysis is shown to occur mainly through the stabilization of the transition state in the binding site due to a combination of favorable hydrophobic and very long - lasting hydrogen bonding interactions .
we have used the accelerated md method to fully study the catalytic mechanism of the cyclophilin a enzyme by simulating the cistrans isomerization of the free substrate taken from the hiv capsid and that of the enzymesubstrate complex , both in explicit solvent .
