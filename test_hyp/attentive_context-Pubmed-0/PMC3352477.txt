our purpose here is to explore the feasibility of small populations that may adaptively respond to overcome allee effects in order to establish , given any amount of genetic variation . in this paper
we model the growth and spread of this population according to a reaction - diffusion equation , and allow evolution to influence inverse density dependent effects through a genetic subsystem that provides the opportunity for successful invasion when otherwise ( under the current , ecological paradigm ) the population would go extinct .
, we present evidence for the enhanced potential for growth and spread of a small introduced population of organisms faced with allee effects when adaptation occurs .
from these results , it is apparent that adaptations that enable organisms to overcome the negative effects of low densities can allow the population to rebound from a trajectory toward extinction to grow to reach carrying capacity .
the deterministic model that we explore in this paper broadly describes population dynamics with density - mediated growth ( i.e. , an allee effect ) and diffusive dispersal .
current management strategies ( e.g. , reducing population density or size ) are based on ecological theory ( e.g. drake et al . 2005 ) , but this evolutionary ecology model suggests that adaptive evolution can enable successful establishment and that ecological considerations alone may not be sufficient . under the assumptions of an allee effect and diffusive dispersal , the idea of ecological size thresholds fits well with the ecological evidence that a large founding population is a primary cause of successful establishment ( lockwood et al .
