because , it is difficult to assess the generated forces clinically , a finite element analysis was chosen for the present study as it is a useful tool in estimating stress distribution in the contact area of the implant with the bone .
on the basis of the observations , of a three dimensional finite element analysis to access stress pattern in different abutment angulations , it can be concluded that though the compressive and tensile stresses generated through axial and oblique loading increase as the abutment angulation increases yet they are within the tolerance limits of the bone .
hence , it was considered appropriate to undertake the study of stresses generated having different angulations to the long axis of the implant , under axial and oblique loading , by finite element modelling and analysis .
however , care should be taken while planning a restoration so as to minimize the oblique component of force .
the three dimensional ( 3d ) finite element analysis study was conducted in the post graduate department of prosthodontics , sardar patel post graduate institute of dental and medical sciences , lucknow - in collaboration with - lelogix design solutions private limited , greater noida , uttar pradesh using the software package solid works 2009 [ figure 1a and 1b ] .
