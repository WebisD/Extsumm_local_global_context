the main goal of the present study was to survey prevalence of cheilospirura hamulosa infection in partridges ( alectoris chukar ) using morphological - based methods , in taleqan county of iran .
out of a total of 100 partridges examined , the prevalence of c. hamulosa was 30% with a mean intensity of 3.9% and range of infection of 112 .
in the present study , we report for the first time the isolation and morphological characterization of cheilospirura hamulosa from partridges in iran . the morphological characters described in this study
the females were amphidelphic , and their vulva is located slightly posterior to the middle of the body at 2.29  0.92 from the posterior end , circular sphincter 0.064  0.065 , tail 0.44 ( n = 1 ) long ( figure 3 , ( a1)-(a2 ) and ( b1)-(b2 ) ) .
the mean of cordons length was 9.2  0.28 , ratio between cordons and body length was 1  :  1.33 ( figure 2 , ( a1)(a3 ) ) , long spicule slender was 1.44  0.08  mm in length , short spicule shaped like a chopping knife was 0.62  0.11  mm long , and ratio between long and short spicules was 1  :  2.3 .
