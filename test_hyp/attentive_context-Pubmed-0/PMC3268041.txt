recently , we prepared a defatted powder of squid viscera treating with sco2 and detected protease , lipase , and amylase activities in crude extract from the powder .  
, we purified a trypsin ( sc - t ) from the mackerel viscera powder treated by sco2 defatting process and compared its enzymatic properties with those of other fish trypsins purified from the viscera defatted by acetone .
with the aim of utilization of fish trypsin for food industry , we purified a trypsin ( sc - t ) from mackerel ( scomber sp . ) viscera powder treated by the sco2 defatting process and compared its enzymatic properties with those of other fish trypsins purified from the viscera defatted by acetone .   in this study
, we adopted the condition of 40c , 25  mpa , and 2.5  h to separate lipids from the viscera .  
previously , we extracted trypsin from the pyloric ceca powder ( 13.9  g ) of spotted mackerel defatted by acetone , and 3,633  mg of total protein and 3,270 u of total trypsin activity were detected in the crude enzyme solution .  
next , we purified a phospholipase a2 from the starfish pyloric ceca defatted by sco2 extraction process .   in this study , with the aim of utilization of fish trypsin for food industry
