the aim of this study was to evaluate the short - term outcomes following conversion from ranibizumab or bevacizumab therapy to aflibercept for the treatment of refractory dme .
patients with center - involving dme who are unresponsive to ranibizumab or bevacizumab demonstrate anatomical and visual improvements after conversion to aflibercept .
the mean cft after the first aflibercept injection reduced significantly to 362.5792.82 mm ( wilcoxon signed - rank test ; p<0.001 ) . at the end of follow - up ,
the mean interval between bevacizumab / ranibizumab injections prior to the switch was 2.42.2 months and the interval between aflibercept injections was 2.42.2 months ( p=0.92 ) .
three of the 21 eyes ( 14% ) had complete resolution of intraretinal cysts at the end of follow - up .
the final visual acuity was significantly better compared with the visual acuity before the switch ( p=0.04 ) .
the mean visual acuity was 0.420.23 logmar just prior to the switch , 0.390.31 logmar after one aflibercept injection , and 0.370.22 logmar at the end of follow - up ( figure 2 ) .
while aflibercept injections are much more costly than bevacizumab , the improvement that can be anticipated in these challenging cases suggests that making the switch is justifiable .
