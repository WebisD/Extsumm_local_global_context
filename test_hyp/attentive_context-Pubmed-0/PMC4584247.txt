the plsr and ls - svm model based on 23 and 11 wavelengths had a good performance to predict tss of mulberries , which indicated that rf algorithm was effective in reducing three - dimensional data .
the specific objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) investigate the potential of vis - nir hyperspectral imaging to detect tss of the mulberry fruits , ( 2 ) select the important wavelengths using rf algorithm , ( 3 ) evaluate the performance of the different calibration models with rf - plsr and rf - ls - svm based on linear and rbf kernel function , ( 4 ) compare the tss visualization results which were developed with plsr and ls - svm and select the optimal calibration model , and ( 5 ) predict tss value of each pixel in tested samples on the basis of the optimal calibration model and generate tss spatial distribution .
to sum up , the successful mapping of tss distribution in mulberries suggested that the application of hyperspectral imaging to realize the visualization of mulberry fruits ' internal quality is feasible and promising .
it could be revealed that plsr was feasible to map chemical component concentration ( tss ) distribution of mulberry fruits .
