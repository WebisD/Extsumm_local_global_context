the potential role of inflammation in stimulating ngal was assessed by the measurement of highly sensitive c - reactive protein ( hscrp ) in a subset of participants .
there was a significant difference between ngal depending on the presence or absence of ams at 5150  m ( figure 3 ) with higher values in those with ams and severe ams . a two - way mixed anova revealed a significant change ( p = 0.003 ) in resting ngal with ascent and an interaction with ams at 4270  m ( p = 0.017 ) and 4910  m ( p = 0.002 for change in ngal , p = 0.027 for interaction with ams ) .  
ngal rises in response to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia ; marked increases in ngal may occur without concomitant arf and the degree of ngal rise at ha is associated with the presence or absence of ams .
the significant novel findings are that ngal rises in response to sustained hypobaric hypoxia but not acute normobaric hypoxia or near sl exercise and that this rise is related to ams at 5150  m.   the rise in ngal following trekking ( by day 2 at 3400  m ) was to the levels normally associated with the subsequent development of arf ( > 150  ng / ml ) , but this did not occur .
