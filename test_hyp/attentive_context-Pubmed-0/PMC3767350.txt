in conclusion , we have shown the dual catalytic activity of i2-sds - h2o system which deprotects the azadienes , oximes , and azabutadienes and produces bis ( alkyl)indoles in situ when indole is present in the reaction medium .
we have also shown that bis- and tris ( indolyl)alkanes can be synthesized in presence of bronsted acid in water . in continuation of our research in hydrated media , herein , we wish to disclose the dual catalytic activity of the system i2-sds - h2o which behaves as a lewis acid   for the cleavage of 2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene , 1-aza-1,3-butadienes , and oximes to produce carbonyls and amines , and the resulting reaction mixture reacts with indoles to produce bis ( indolyl)alkanes in situ at room temperature under neutral conditions .
, we reported that surfactant- ( sds- ) mediated cleavage of c = n bonds could be achieved with acetic anhydride   and surfactant - i2-water can be used for the deprotection of imines to carbonyls .
the two - step reaction can be carried out without using acid , transition metals , and organic solvents . besides , the reaction condition is mild and can be done in water under neutral condition which contributes to the criteria of green chemistry .
