the issue assumes significance as a focus of head and neck surgeries ( including the sistrunk procedure ) now is shifting toward outpatient , same - day , and ambulatory surgeries.5

 9 studies demonstrate same - day surgery to be a safer , less costly , and reasonable alternative to admission surgery , without increased patient risk.8 
 9 with a general tendency to reduce hospital stays and with the sistrunk technique being increasingly performed in same - day , outpatient settings , evaluating the impact of drain placement with the technique on postoperative complications and patient morbidity is essential.5

  with this objective , we conducted a retrospective study at our hospital to explore if same - day , outpatient sistrunk procedure performed without drain placement was a safe alternative versus the same procedure with drain placement .
the chi - square test compared both group of patients in terms of any sistrunk procedure - related complications ( h - s , aspiration required , wound infection , pus , and number of follow - up visits ) .
the groups did not show any statistical significant difference in sistrunk - related complications in the fisher exact ( two - sided ) test : h - s ( p  =  0.08 ) , aspiration required ( p  =  0.29 ) , wound infection ( p  >  0.99 ) , and pus formation ( p  =  0.35 ; table 2 ) .
