we report two cases of successful management of postoperative chylothorax , following surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia , both in full - term newborn babies , using an escalating regimen of octeriotide infusion .
octeriotide is a relatively safe second line therapy in the management of chylothorax secondary to surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia .
somatostatin , or its analog octeriotide , has recently been used with success in a number of pediatric cases of postoperative and iatrogenic chylothorax . in pediatric patients
postoperative chylothorax is a serious complication with a high mortality , which can approach 50% in untreated patients .
the incidence of chylothorax following surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia ranges from 7 to 28% .
previously published studies on the use of octeriotide in postoperative chylothorax following repair of 
 diaphragmatic hernia
a term female 3.5-kg infant , diagnosed with left diaphragmatic hernia on antenatal ultrasound scan done at 19 week of gestation , was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery in a very good condition .
a trial of octeriotide therapy can prevent potential permanent surgical procedures like pleurodesis or pleuroperitoneal shunts .
we reviewed the literature to find out the most effective dose or regimen of octeriotide infusion in the management of chylothorax following repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia .
