recently , mutations in the sarcomeric protein genes ( cardiac troponin i , tnni3 ; cardiac troponin t , tnnt2 ; -cardiac actin , actc ; -myosin heavy chain , myh7 ) have been identified in pediatric rcm , which suggests that sarcomeric protein mutations may be important causes of rcm. here , we performed genetic investigations of candidate genes that have been reported in rcm and identified a missense mutation in the tnni3 gene in a 12-year - old girl with rcm .
, we report a tnni3 missense mutation ( r192h ) in idiopathic rcm in a 12-year - old chinese girl .
this case further improves our knowledge of the causes of cardiomyopathic disease and shows that the spectrum of sarcomeric gene mutations may be involved in pediatric rcm .
restrictive cardiomyopathy ( rcm ) is very rare in children and it is characterized by dilated atria , elevated end - ventricular diastolic pressure , and severe diastolic dysfunction resulting from increased stiffness of the myocardium , .
rcm carries a poor prognosis with a low survival rate and ultimately requires heart transplantation. pediatric rcm is most commonly idiopathic and its molecular basis is still unclear .
