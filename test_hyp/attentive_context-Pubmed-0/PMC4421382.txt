our recent experience with a uraemic 56-year - old caucasian showing only unilateral moderate right - sided hydronephrosis is presented .
symptomatic supravesical obstructive uropathy in a patient with dual functioning kidneys is classically characterized by bilateral hydroureters / hydronephrosis and an empty urinary bladder .
this obstruction may be secondary to metastatic abdomino - pelvic and retroperitoneal malignancies , ureteric calculi and retroperitoneal fibrosis  
a 56-year - old caucasian male patient with a past medical history that included hypertension and coronary artery disease and a recent serum creatinine of 88.4 mol / l , was diagnosed 10 days earlier with urinary tract infection ( uti ) .
we note that we were not able to carry out any split renal functional testing after recovery as the patient 's primary attention at this point was to find out treatment options for his cancer .
. the evidence for obstruction may be partially or totally absent on ultrasound or computerized tomography , in one or both kidneys   .
the classic picture of bilateral hydronephrosis with hydroureters and an empty urinary bladder , in symptomatic uraemia following supravesical obstruction , in patients with dual functioning kidneys , is well acknowledged .
a patient with dual functioning kidneys presenting with uraemic symptoms and suspected to have obstructive uropathy must be presumed to necessarily have bilateral renal obstruction   .
