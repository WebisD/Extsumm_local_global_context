iop was reduced from 21.9 ( 9.8 ) mmhg preoperatively to 11.9 ( 4.7 ) mmhg on the last follow - up visit in the control group . in the scb group ,
the number of iop - lowering medications was reduced from 3.1 ( 1.0 ) to 0.4 ( 0.8 ) in the control group and from 3.0 ( 1.1 ) to 0.7 ( 1.1 ) in the scb group .
the mean final iop was slightly higher in the scb group ( 14.0  4.7  mmhg ) compared to that of the control group ( 11.9  4.7  mmhg ) ; however the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.36 ) .
the mean follow - up time was 19.6 ( 11.5 ) and 16.8 ( 8.2 ) months for the control and scb groups , respectively .
the study by sengupta and associates is a randomized study comparing the uses of mmc ( 0.03% for 3 minutes ) , direct intraoperative bevacizumab application on the scleral using a sponge and three doses of scb ( 1.25  mg ) in patients undergoing phacotrabeculectomy . in their study , the patients randomized to the scb group received two doses of scb during the surgery and the third dose at one week . at six months , they reported a higher rate of success ( iop less than 18  mmhg ) in the scb group compared to those of the other two groups ( 90% versus 60% ) .
