a subgroup analysis was conducted on the last 30 consecutive patients using data after three months of treatment with l - t4 soft gel capsules ( table 3 ) .
the results of this study suggest that , in general , both the liquid and soft gel capsule formulations of l - t4 can be taken with breakfast .
this study , the  titi  study ( tirosint-versus - tiche study , ibsa italia ) , looked to extend these findings by investigating whether an l - t4 soft gel capsule formulation could also be safely and effectively administered to stable euthyroid patients during each patient 's normal breakfast without any malabsorption .
significant reductions in ft3 and ft4 levels were observed between 3 and 6 months ' treatment with l - t4 soft gel capsules whereas there was a slight increase in tsh value .
priority should however be given to the liquid l - t4 formulation in those patients where even small changes in ft4 and ft3 levels need to be avoided , such as those receiving suppressive therapy for thyroid cancer and/or cardiopathic patients receiving substitutive l - t4 therapy .
all patients were assessed for thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) , free t4 ( ft4 ) , and free t3 ( ft3 ) levels and were switched from liquid l - t4 to the soft gel capsule formulation at the same dosage of l - t4 , ingested during each patient 's normal breakfast .
