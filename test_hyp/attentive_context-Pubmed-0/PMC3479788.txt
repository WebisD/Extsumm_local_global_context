our results indicate not only that the degree of the expression of hat1 and hdac1 might have a prognostic value in predicting the clinical behavior of dlbcl but also that the specific use of hdac inhibitors might lead to better treatment outcomes of the chemotherapy in cases of malignant lymphoma .
the mean follow - up periods were 31 , 18 , and 15.8 months in cases of dlbcl , ptcl - nos , and nktcl , respectively ( range , 1 to 162 months ) . of the three types of lymphoma ,
the proliferation index was correlated to the degree of the expression of hat1 and hdac1 in cases of dlbcl . following an analysis of the survival curve , the degree of the expression of hat1 and hdac1 was higher in association with the aggressiveness and a poor survival in cases of dlbcl .
the degree of the expression of hat1 was significantly higher in cases of dlbcl ( 3/4 ) and those of ptcl - nos ( 2/3 ) as compared with those of rlh ( p<0.05 ) . in the remaining cases of dlbcl ( 1/4 ) or ptcl - nos ( 1/3 ) , however , the degree of the expression of hat1 was higher as compared with those of rlh .
