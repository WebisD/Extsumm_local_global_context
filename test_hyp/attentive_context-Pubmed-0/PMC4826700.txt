a systematic literature search was conducted in the pubmed and embase databases and search terms were used as follows : ( 1 )  human papillomavirus and pregnancy  ; ( 2 )  human papillomavirus and preterm delivery  ; ( 3 )  human papillomavirus and preterm birth  ; ( 4 )  human papillomavirus and abortion  .
we focused on pregnancies with adverse outcome and included a discussion of possible factors influencing or explaining the reported differences in hpv detection rates .
in this quantitative analysis on the prevalence of hpv infection in normal pregnancies and pregnancies with adverse outcome , 45 studies were included and data on 14  470 pregnant women were analyzed and summarized .
the highest hpv prevalence could be reported in cervix ( 17.5% ; 95% ci ; 17.317.7 ) and in the population from latin america ( 35.5% ( 95% ci ; 34.636.5 ) ) and usa ( 29.6% ( 95% ci ; 29.529.7 ) ) . in comparison to hpv prevalence found in normal pregnancies , spontaneous abortions and spontaneous preterm deliveries were found to have higher hpv positive detection rates ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 ) , in both placenta ( spontaneous abortions : 24.9% , and preterm deliveries : 50% versus 8.3% , resp . ) and cervix ( spontaneous abortions : 24.5% , and preterm deliveries : 47% versus 17.5% , resp . ) . beyond the geographical location , the time point of sample collection in pregnancy as well as the hpv detection methods used may influence the results on hpv prevalence .
