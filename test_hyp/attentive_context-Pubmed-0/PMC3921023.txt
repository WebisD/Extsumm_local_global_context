the presence of concomitant cranial nerve signs or facial weakness generally prompts a search for cerebral etiologies such as stroke , neoplasms or inflammatory processes , while it may occasionally be due to a lesion located in the high cervical spinal cord.1 in this concise review , we describe the features of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma ( sseh ) , which is a rare cause of spinal cord compression and a neurological emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management to prevent morbidity and mortality.2,3 most sseh patients present with either paraplegia or tetraplegia ; however , there are numerous descriptions about acute hemiparesis as an initial manifestation of sseh , which may lead physicians to include an acute ischemic cerebrovascular event as a diagnostic consideration,4 thus leading to the concept that sseh should be included in the large list of stroke mimics . in the following sections , we also discuss various concerns regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic conundrums associated with this disease .
sseh represents a rare spinal emergency , with a frequency accounting for less than 1% of spinal epidural space- occupying lesions.2,3 jackson first described sseh in a 14-year - old female in 1869,5 and the first surgically - treated case was reported by bain in 1897.6 although the introduction of neuroradiological investigations and progress in neurosurgery may lead to a sharp increase in the number of diagnoses of spinal bleeding,7 only approximately 530 cases were included in the largest recent literature search for sseh.8 holtas et al have reported their experience with 13 patients with sseh during a nine - year period in a population of 1.49 million total patients , giving an incidence , on the basis of their population , of approximately 0.1 patient per 100,000 patients per year.9 most of the patients present in their 60s or 70s , but all age groups from six months10 to late 80s have been affected , with a slight predominance of the male sex.2,7 any level of the spinal canal may be involved ; the location of the hematoma appears to have a bimodal distribution , with peaks at c6 to c7 and t12,2,8 while the level distribution has been shown to depend strongly on age .
