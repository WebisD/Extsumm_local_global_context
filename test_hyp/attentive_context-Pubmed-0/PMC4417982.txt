we have previously shown that lactobacillus ( l. ) acidophilus treatment can efficiently ameliorate dextran sodium sulfate- ( dss- ) induced experimental colitis in mice . in the present study , we examined whether the therapeutic effect of l. acidophilus is achieved through suppression of the il-23/th17 pathway , including th17 cell differentiation and the expansion factors il-23 , tgf1 , and stat3 , as well as th17 cell - secreted cytokines il-17 and tnf. we found that oral administration of l. acidophilus at all doses induced a significant downregulation of colitis - enhanced expression of all the examined factors .
these findings indicate that the therapeutic role of l. acidophilus in ibd treatment , at least in part , involves modulating the il-23/th17 immune axis .
, we showed that oral administration of l. acidophilus suppressed colitis - associated hyper - response of the il-23/th17 axis .
ibds , including uc and cd , are considered a consequence of aberrant immune response in the gastrointestinal tract .
moreover , recent studies have shown that the expression levels of tgf1 and il-23 are both enhanced in ibd   , thereby promoting the progression of inflammation by activating th17 differentiation and function . in this study , we showed for the first time that l. acidophilus inhibits the colitis - mediated increase in tgf1 and il-23 expression in mouse colon .
