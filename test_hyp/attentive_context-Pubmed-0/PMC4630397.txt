finally , we will discuss the potential roles of amyloid cofactors in -cells degeneration associated with iapp aggregation and amyloid deposition .
we will mainly focus on the roles of amyloid cofactors and/or the biological environment in amyloid formation . as the role of model membranes in iapp fibrillogenesis has been previously discussed in outstanding reviews  
, we will initially describe iapp structure and normal physiological functions and briefly present its proposed mechanisms of aggregation .
considering that the simplistic model of iapp fibrillogenesis as a homogenous self - assembly process does not recapitulate amyloid deposition associated with the etiology of type ii diabetes , it will be important in the future to develop in vitro experimental conditions to study iapp aggregation that resemble the complexity of the pancreatic islet environment .
this suggests that iapp concentration is not the critical factor contributing to its aggregation and proposes that other elements could play a determinant role in the amyloidogenic process and , accordingly , in the etiology of type ii diabetes . in this review
as summarized in this review , the role of the so - called accessory amyloid biomolecules in iapp amyloidogenesis has been recently investigated by a combination of biophysical approaches .
