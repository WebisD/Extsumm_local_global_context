decrease leukocytes count by hu treatment in ami rats can reduce inflammatory reaction significantly and improve heart functions after ami , suggesting that leukocyte reduction through hu treatment might be a promising preventive and treatment option for ami .
the remaining 36 ami rats were randomly divided into the hu group and vehicle control ami group ( vehicle ami group ) with 18 rats in each group . for rats in the hu group ,
here , we decreased leukocyte counts by hu treatment in a rat ami model to interrupt the inflammatory reaction process .
further , hu treatment significantly decreased their level , concomitant with an improvement of cardiac function in ami rats .
our results show that the level of inflammatory cytokines , amount of leukocyte infiltration into myocardial interstitium , and cardiac function index were all reduced by hu treatment in a rat ami model , suggesting that leukocyte reduction through hu treatment might be a promising preventive and treatment option for ami . why does leukocyte accumulation exacerbate tissue injury in ami ?
our elisa analysis showed that icam-1 , ps and paf were all increased in ami rats , indicating the role of these inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of ami .
