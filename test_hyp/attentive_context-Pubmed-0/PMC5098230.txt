the photodynamics 
 of a unidirectional molecular motor has been 
 studied by time - resolved ir spectroscopy in which both vibrational 
 and electronic structures are probed . in combination with quantum 
 mechanical calculations , the high structural sensitivity and real - time 
 character of the technique allows us to understand fundamental aspects 
 of the operation mechanism .
the performance of photoinitiated 
 unidirectional rotation thus involves a multicoupled - state optimization 
 of nuclear motion .
the results show that conversion of photon 
 energy into directed motion proceeds on the potential energy surfaces 
 of two different electronic states , which is the more important as 
 it implies that the conical intersection between the  dark  
 electronically excited state and the ground state determines the efficiency 
 of the motor . to rationally tune
these techniques offer 
 a high time resolution but provide only indirect information as to 
 how the structure evolves spatially over time . in the present contribution 
 we show that this information can be obtained through a combination 
 of picosecond time - resolved vibrational spectroscopy of the electronically 
 excited states together with quantum - mechanical calculations .
time - resolved studies are essential to elucidate these dynamics but 
 have thus far focused on probing the change in the electronic structure 
 after photoexcitation through uv / vis absorption and fluorescence studies .
