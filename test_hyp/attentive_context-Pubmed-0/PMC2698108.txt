a single pair of sensitivity and specificity values is insufficient to describe the full range of diagnostic performance of a test .
the first one , which is referred to as a , is the standardized difference in the means of the distributions of the test results for those subjects with and without the condition ( appendix ) ( 2 , 4 ) .
sensitivity and specificity , which are defined as the number of true positive decisions / the number of actually positive cases and the number of true negative decisions / the number of actually negative cases , respectively , constitute the basic measures of performance of diagnostic tests ( table 1 ) .
if the data are actually binormal or if a known function can transform the data so that it follows a binormal distribution , parameters a ( the standardized difference in the means of the distributions of the test results for those subjects with and without the condition ) and b ( the ratio of the standard deviations of the distributions of the test results for those subjects without versus those with the condition ) can be estimated directly from the means and standard deviations of the distributions of those subjects with and without the condition .
