the processes underlying the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution are difficult to test experimentally , but a new study in bmc biology   of pines and their mycorrhizal fungi , provides the first experimental support for one of the key processes .
has been the focus of the paper in bmc biology , which is the first to examine explicitly the g  g  e interactions required for a selection mosaic to generate coevolutionary change .
large - scale studies of geographical patterns are still crucial for solidifying the foundations of the theory , and for parameterizing the next generation of theoretical models .
although this theory has been widely discussed and has become a unifying framework for many coevolutionary studies , it is still often misunderstood .
the area of the theory to which this limitation applies most is the demonstration of selection mosaics , and as a result these have received little rigorous attention . resolving this deficiency
it is significant that thompson 's book the coevolutionary process , which first brought his theory to most of the scientific community , emphasizes process rather than pattern .
how is the genetic variation that is the raw material of coevolution , or any other sort of evolution for that matter , maintained when faster or longer is always better ?
