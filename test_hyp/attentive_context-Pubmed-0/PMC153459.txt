inspection of the database of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins ( cogs )   revealed only one family of such proteins that is represented in most of the sequenced bacterial , archaeal and eukaryotic genomes .
the near ubiquity of the rhomboid family among bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes , along with the remarkable functional conservation , suggests that a signaling mechanism mediated by rhomboids might have functioned already in the last common ancestor of all extant life forms , with subsequent loss in several lineages . to address this possibility
, comparative - genomic and experimental analyses aimed at determining relative rates of gene loss and hgt will help in a more objective assessment of the validity of this argument .
eukaryotic rhomboid family proteins seem to show considerable functional variability ; in particular , cross - talk might exist between different rip pathways . a distinct representative of the rhomboid family has been shown to physically interact with presinilins 1 and 2 , and was accordingly named presenilins - associated rhomboid - like protein ( parl ) .
the prototype of this family is the rhomboid ( rho ) protein from drosophila melanogaster , a developmental regulator involved in epidermal growth factor ( egf)-dependent signaling pathways [ 2 - 4 ] .
