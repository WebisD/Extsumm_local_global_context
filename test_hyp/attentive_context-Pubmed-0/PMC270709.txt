a 29-year - old male develops severe pancreatitis , presumably as a result of heavy alcohol intake .
the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit and , in the course of investigation , he has an abdominal computed tomography scan that shows an inflamed pancreas with some necrotic areas .
we presently use antibiotics in this population only when computed tomography - guided aspiration biopsy of pancreatic necrosis reveals bacterial pathogens .
we believe that a multicenter , double - blind , prospective , randomized trial is warranted prior to the use of antibiotics in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis .
although there are no obvious signs of infection , you wonder whether antibiotics are useful in the patient 's management .
lorne h blackbourne and stephen m cohn " meta - analysis is to statistical data analysis what metaphysics is to theoretical physics ! " utilizing meta - analyses of tiny , inconclusive and , in some instances , flawed clinical trials to justify the use of a modality ( broad - spectrum antibiotics ) with known adverse impact ( microbial resistance , superinfection , drug toxicity and cost ) appears unfounded .
he is admitted to the hospital ward for management but becomes hypoxic over the first 24 hours , requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation .
