we report a patient with n. gonorrhoeae bacteremia in whom massive variceal hemorrhage occurs coincidently .
on june 5th , 2010 , a 42-yr - old man was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room due to multiple seizures , a history of chills , myalgia over the previous 2 weeks , and 3 days of melena .
neisseria gonorrhoeae is a well - known cause of sexually transmitted diseases such as genital , pharyngeal , and anorectal infections .
hemorrhage of esophageal varices should be considered as a risk factor for dgi in patients in which n. gonorrhoeae grows from blood cultures .
bloodstream invasion , however , occurs only in 0.5 - 3% of the infections and results in disseminated gonococcal infection ( dgi ) .
unusual clinical conditions of the patient , combined with the microbiological characteristics of the isolates , postponed the identification of n. gonorrhoeae .
n. gonorrhoeae is a pathogenic neisseria species that mainly causes genital infections , and , less frequently , also causes pharyngeal and anorectal infections   .
only one case of dgi with polyarthralgias and skin lesions has been previously reported in korea .
cefotaxime was started empirically in the emergency room , and vancomycin was added after the report of positive blood cultures of gram - positive cocci on day 2 . on day 3 , fever was no longer present , and follow - up blood cultures were negative . the patient was discharged on day 8 .
