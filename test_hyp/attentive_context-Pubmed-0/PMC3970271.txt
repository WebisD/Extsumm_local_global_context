the authors report a case of a patient with aplastic anemia who received a total of approximately 1,400 units of red blood cells ( rbcs ) over 15 years .
she was admitted for asymptomatic hypocalcaemia and diagnosed with secondary hemochromatosis accompanied by hypoparathyroidism , hypothyroidism , hepatic dysfunction , and cardiac dysfunction . to the best of the author 's knowledge ,
hemochromatosis is a hereditary or secondary disorder resulting from iron - overload and iron - impregnation in the organs , leading to organ damage .
hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease common in caucasians and caused by a gene mutation related to iron absorption in the bowels .
unlike hereditary hemochromatosis where iron is impregnated in parenchymal cells , repeated transfusion induced - iron - overload mainly impregnates iron into reticuloendothelial cells which has been considered to be less harmful organ failure than parenchymal iron accumulation .
therefore , it is critical to restrict transfusions and iron chelate agents as needed , and schedule patients for regular follow - up visits . furthermore , it is necessary to establish screening examinations each period , with a larger - scale study requiring repeated transfusions to clarify the effects of the amount and period of blood transfusions on endocrine failure .
