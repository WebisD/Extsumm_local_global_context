the mammary gland has been a pivotal feature in the evolution and taxonomic classification of animal species , and it has even had a role in the acceptance of evolutionary theory .
danielle lemay and colleagues , in a recent report in genome biology , have taken this important step towards greater understanding through comparative genomics .
continued research in mammary gland biology that incorporates comparative genomic and physiological studies of animals with varied and extreme adaptations to lactation will be necessary to provide insights into the development and regulation of mammary gland function , as well as the probable evolution of these processes .
for example , a systematic study of the role of micrornas in mammary development and lactation is likely to be a fruitful area of investigation . because no single species can provide an ample and sufficient model for the physiology of another , and because the potential gain in knowledge from comparative studies is great
sequencing and assembly of the bovine genome , establishment of mammary transcriptome and proteome libraries , the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms , and discoveries and developments to come , are providing important tools for agricultural scientists to investigate the biology of lactation and to adopt genotype - based breeding schemes to select for desired traits .
