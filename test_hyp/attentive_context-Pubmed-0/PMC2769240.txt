the results of three pilot single - center , single - dose , randomized , double - blind , double - dummy , parallel - group , placebo- and active - controlled studies using the model of exercise - induced muscle pain were pooled for a meta - analysis as the individual studies were underpowered to compare efficacy and safety of diractin with placebo and oral ketoprofen .
for the calf ( n = 9 ) , the average sum of pain scores documented for the treated calves was 29.4 ( range 13 to 55 ) and in the untreated 32.9 ( range 6 to 65 ) .
doms was shown to be an appropriate pain model for evaluating the therapeutic effect of epicutaneous diractin on acute muscle pain .
the subjects documented higher pain scores for the calf than for the thigh , maximum pain was observed within 24 to 48 hours after exercise ( average categorical pain score at time of maximum pain for untreated thigh : 2.6  2.2 ; for untreated calf : 5.1  1.9 ) .
the average sum of categorical pain scores documented for the treated thighs ( n = 19 ) was 12.4 ( range 0 to 29 ) and 14.8 ( range 0 to 42 ) in the untreated thighs .
