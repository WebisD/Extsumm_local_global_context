a 36-year - old man presented with sudden severe occipital headache , and neck stiffness in may 1999 . after several weeks , the headache subsided , however , blurred vision subsequently developed .
the mass was surgically excised , and histopathologic examination revealed a typical adamantinous craniopharyngioma with anastomosing epithelial islands and a palisaded layer of cells , as well as an area of keratinization and numerous calcifications ( fig .
t1-weighted ( 665/14/2 [ repetition time / echo time / excitation ] ) and t2-weighted ( 4200/99/2 ) mr images showed a large cystic mass with a small solid portion in the left temporal lobe ( figs .
the combination of papillary and adamantinous tumor parts within the same neoplasm has been described in 15% of these tumors . in summary , although our case did not show any specific radiologic finding permitting the differentiation of craniopharyngioma , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of a craniopharyngioma originating in the temporal lobe .
craniopharyngiomas are generally considered to be epithelial tumors arising from remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct , which connects the stomodeal ectoderm with the evaginated rathke 's pouch , which in turn forms the adenohypophysis ( 7 , 8) .
