to establish strategies for early non - response to an antipsychotic drug in the treatment of acute - phase schizophrenia , evidence for antipsychotic switching , augmentation , or high - doses has gradually been accumulating .
strategies for early non - response to an antipsychotic drug in acute - phase schizophrenia are discussed ( fig .
more studies performed in actual clinical practice with minimal bias are required to assist clinicians in making rational treatment decisions .
as a strategy for antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia , monotherapy is clearly optimal when both effective and tolerated . when a patient fails to respond to an adequate dose of an antipsychotic , however , the alternatives include switching , administering a dose higher than the licensed dose , polypharmacy or clozapine .
little evidence has been accumulated from acute - phase practice , as enrolling acute psychotic and agitated patients in randomized clinical trials is challenging , particularly when using a double - blind design . however , most clinical guidelines are based on findings from double - blind trials , which include ideal patients.1 ) such guidelines are therefore not necessarily useful in actual clinical practice . from this practical perspective ,
