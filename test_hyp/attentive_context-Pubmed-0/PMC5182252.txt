this study aimed to investigate the relationship between indoor environmental risk factors and occurrence of lung function decline in adult residents in summer in zunyi city of southwest china .
environmental tobacco smoke and coal fuel use were associated with impaired lung function among adults in summer season .
we identified a number of home environmental factors associated with lung function decline among chinese adults . cooking oil fumes ,
the subjects reported the presence of mould in their bedrooms showed significant deficits in fvc ( p=0.001 ) , fev1 ( p=0.006 ) and pefr ( p=0.002 ) as compared with those who reported the absence of mould in their bedrooms ( table 2 ) . pulmonary function ( fvc , fev1 , fev1/fvc and pefr ) in adults by kitchen risk factors in summer season nonparametric test ( mann - whitney u test or kruskal - wallis test ) , = 0.05 ; significant at p<0.05 , significant at p<0.01 , significant at p<0.001 in comparison to non - smokers , both current smokers and ex - smokers were having lower values of fvc ( p<0.001 ) , fev1 ( p<0.001 ) and pefr ( p<0.001 ) .
subjects exposed coal fuel combustion , cooking oil fumes , pest in kitchen , mosquito repellent , fluffy blanket , pets , visible mold in bedroom and ets ( active and passive smoking ) tended to exhibit greater decreases in fvc , fev1 and pefr values compared with their non - exposed counterparts .
