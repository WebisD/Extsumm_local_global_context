the aim of this study was to investigate construct validity of the mdsp with sem .
although sufficient and fairly sound psychometric properties were shown for the new instrument,9 further testing is needed , especially the issue of construct validity tested with structural equation modeling ( sem ) , because the instrument is grounded in a theory .
the instrument will be researched further , in order to measure and describe moral development in different groups of professionals and students and , also , to relate the measures to behavior and aspects of personality . in conclusion , the results of this study show that the mdsp is an instrument that shows a high degree of construct validity with close correspondence to its theoretical base .

, arnold4 argues that the fundamental place of reason in morality can not be dismissed , and should be investigated further and clarified in future empirical studies . to be able to investigate moral development among individuals according to kohlberg s theory within a quantitative research paradigm , reliable and valid instruments are essential . in order to study moral development according to this theory in a culturally coherent way in scandinavia , an instrument , the moral development scale for professionals ( mdsp)9 has been developed and initially tested for reliability and validity in norway , where a number of items following the conventional and postconventional levels in the theory2,3 were developed .
