new developments are also herein discussed , showing the involvement of tsp-1 in pivotal transcriptional pathways related to inflammation and inflammation - induced carcinogenesis .
tsp-1 interacts with a variety of factors in a synergistic way , playing a crucial role in many stages of the inflammatory response .
this paper focuses on well - known interactions of tsp-1 with key receptors and growth factors during the initial inflammatory events throughout the chronic inflammatory processes .
we also reviewed recent developments explaining how tsp-1 and its derived peptides directly or indirectly regulate inflammatory events in animal models and human diseases .  
tsp-1 is the best - studied member of the thrombospondin ( tsp ) family , which consists of five extracellular calcium - binding multifunctional proteins : tsp-1 , tsp-2 , tsp-3 , tsp-4 , and tsp-5 . tsp-1 and tsp-2 are structurally similar , and they are expressed on the cell surface during physiological events . a variety of normal cells , including endothelial cells , fibroblasts , adipocytes , smooth muscle cells , monocytes , macrophages , and transformed cells such as malignant glioma cells , secrete tsp-1   .   
finally , new insights about key signaling pathways such as nf-b and stat3 were discussed . because chronic inflammation is linked with tumor development
