therefore , the aim of the present work was to investigate the prevalence and species of intestinal microsporidiosis among animals in giza , egypt .
a total of 869 fecal samples were separately collected from animals in giza , egypt in 20122013 .
e. bieneusi was the most prevalent intestinal microsporidia in domesticated animals that may play a role in dissemination of intestinal microsporidiosis in the environment .

76.8% and 42.1 % of the pcr positive animal fecal samples had e. bieneusi and e. intestinalis , respectively .
the highest rate of infection with intestinal microsporidia was recorded in dogs ( 33.3% ) , followed by 23.1 , 20.5 , 18.8 , 14.9 , 14.3 , 11.2 , 9.1 and 6.9% in cats , goats , pigs , rabbits , cattle , sheep , donkeys and buffaloes , respectively ( table 2 and fig .
bar = 5m molecularly , intestinal microsporidial spores were recorded in 95 ( 64.2% ) out of the 148 microscopically positive samples .
