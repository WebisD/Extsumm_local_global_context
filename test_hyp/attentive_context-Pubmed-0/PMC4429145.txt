the study evaluated the concentration of 25(oh)d3 and the indices of calcium  phosphate metabolism depending on the sex , number of relapses , degree of motor disability and the applied treatment at different stages of relapsing  remitting ms ( rrms ) .
the study evaluated the concentration of 25(oh)d3 and the indices of calcium  phosphate metabolism depending on the sex , number of relapses , degree of motor disability and the applied treatment at different stages of relapsing  remitting ms ( rrms ) .
the present study showed that in patients with rrms , serum concentrations of 25(oh)d3 and ionised calcium were significantly lower compared to healthy individuals and decreased with the duration of the disease , with the increase in relapses and in females compared to males .
the limitation of the present study is a small number of patients with rrms and healthy controls .

 m male , f female parameters of calcium  phosphate metabolism in the examined groups , depending on sex ( mean    sd ) the increase in serum parathormone concentration was observed with the increase in relapses ( r  =  0.51 , p  <  0.001 ) in the conducted correlation analysis between the number of relapses , the degree of disability and the indices of calcium  phosphate metabolism in all patients .
