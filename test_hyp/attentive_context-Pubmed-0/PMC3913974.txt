likewise , the abilities of ao - slo have the potential to provide a new approach for the diagnosis and monitoring of chloroquine toxicity .
a 53-year - old asian woman with a history of lupus erythematosus was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine ( plaquenil , unknown dose ) for 5 years .
bull 's eye maculopathy , a type of retinopathy , is associated with the use of antimalarial agents and is relatively rare . however , bull 's eye maculopathy is the most serious of the ocular adverse effects and is of serious pathologic concern , as the associated visual changes can be severe and there is little chance of visual recovery .
, we overcame these problems by adopting dual lcos - slm to compensate the two orthogonal polarization components and sequential processing of slo imaging and measurement / compensation of aberrations .
, our results suggest that ao - slo should provide a non - invasive , quantitative , high - resolution modality for imaging chloroquine retinopathy patients .
, we showed that ao - slo can image cellular structures of the retina in living eyes in order to detect preclinical stages of chloroquine associated retinal damage that may not be apparent on standard clinical tests ( e.g. , fundus photography , fa , hvf , and electrophysiological testing ) .
