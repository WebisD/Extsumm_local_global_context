however , with the application of pleural manometry , all cases of unexpandable lung can be accurately diagnosed .
unexpandable lung is a mechanical complication resulting in the inability of the lung to expand to the chest wall . in clinical practice , an unexpandable lung may be due to either the presence of pleural disease , endobronchial obstruction resulting in lobar collapse , or chronic atelectasis .
unexpandable lung due to pleural disease is clinically obvious when a pneumothorax develops following thoracentesis or when chest pain develops during or following pleural fluid removal .
this pathophysiologic mechanism is further supported by the safety data reported by cerfolio and colleagues   on removing chest tubes in post - lobectomy patients despite the presence of a persistent air leak or a pneumothorax .
unexpandable lung resulting from an endobronchial obstruction is managed by removing either the tumor or foreign body impeding normal lung expansion . in the setting of chronic atelectasis ,
the term trapped lung has traditionally been used interchangeably to describe an unexpandable lung occurring from either active or remote pleural disease . currently , we have adopted a more strict definition for a trapped lung .
the pathophysiology of drainage - related pneumothorax is the result of transient , pressure - dependent , parenchymal - pleural fistulas , which develop as a consequence of an existing unexpandable lung unable to conform to the shape of the chest wall with fluid removal .
