there are likely multiple mechanisms driving the current epidemic of obesity , diabetes , and cardiorenal disease .
future studies should investigate the effect of reducing fructose intake or blocking the metabolic effects of fructose as a means for preventing or treating these important diseases .
fructose is a monosaccharide that is widely available in natural food sources such as fruits and honey .
it has been suggested that the increase in added sugars worldwide may partially explain the marked increase in frequency of overweight and obese humans and may explain the rising frequency of metabolic syndrome , diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular diseases ( coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , stroke , and chronic kidney disease )   .  
the transient atp depletion has some similarities to ischemia and can result in arrest of protein synthesis with the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation   .  
this results in the generation of amp which is metabolized by amp deaminase to inosine monophosphate and eventually to uric acid .
perhaps not surprisingly , clinical studies have linked the intake of excessive fructose with the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in humans , and the amount of fructose ingested correlates with the risk for progression to cirrhosis   .
