probe 14 enables us to detect 
 as little as 14 amol 
 of 8-oxodguo in 34 h. typical experiments used 1 ng of dna 
 substrate , and the quantitative analysis agrees well with data obtained 
 using enzyme digestion and lc / ms analysis .
herein , we have improved the limit of detection to 14 amol and decreased 
 the time required to complete the analysis to 3 h by combining qpcr 
 with a new biotinylated reagent .
this method was time - consuming due to 
 a lengthy procedure for preparing the plates on which the lesions 
 were quantified .
the amount of dna substrate used in the assay is considerably less 
 than that in a typical experiment using lc / ms .
following 
 the adsorption of tagged dna to a surface , the biotinylated material 
 is used to capture a streptavidin  horseradish peroxidase complex , 
 which yields the signal by oxidizing a profluorescent molecule to 
 a fluorescent one .
however , oxidation 
 of 8-oxodguo or fapydg in the presence of an amine nucleophile , 
 such as a spermine ( rnh2 ) , provides a dna adduct ( scheme 1 ) in competition with gh and sp . we previously 
 reported a method for selectively detecting 8-oxodguo and the mechanistically 
 related fapydg lesion by utilizing this chemistry , first reported 
 by burrows , and 1 as a nucleophile to trap the reactive 
 oxidized species . fapydg and
