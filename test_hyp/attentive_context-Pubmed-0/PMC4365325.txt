the aim of our work is to explore the possibility of optimizing an on - line spe / uhplc - ms / ms method for pfca and pfsa ranging , respectively , from 4 to 12 and from 4 to 8 carbon atoms and to understand the factors that influence the method accuracy .
the use of on - line spe coupled with uhplc , with 2  m particle size columns , made the development of faster methodology by reducing the analysis time and thus increasing the sample throughput possible .
manual sample preparation was reduced to sample centrifugation and acidification , thus eliminating several procedural errors and contamination and significantly reducing costs and analytical time , which was only about 20  min from extraction to analysis .
, we present the development and validation of a rapid analytical method for the simultaneous determination of compounds with different polarities and other physicochemical properties such as pfca and pfsa .
the method is able to measure contaminants at the environmental levels in urbanized and industrialized areas and attain most of the adopted quality standards except for european eqs for pfos ( 0.65  ng / l ) which is considered a challenging limit for every lc - ms analytical method .
