reporting brucellosis cases to public health officials is another component in protecting others from this disease .
although brucellosis is a rare disease in the united states , its potential use as a bioweapon highlights the need for accurate and rapid identification ( 15 ) . in this investigation
neither laboratory worker could identify any other possible sources of infection , and because brucellosis is a rare disease in new york , the connection between these three patients is plausible . with the initial interpretations of these gram stains as gram - variable , which resulted in misidentification of the organism by three different laboratories , nysdoh initiated an effort to educate clinical laboratories in new york state about the potential difficulties in characterizing the organism and the importance of primary gram stain interpretation .
this investigation suggests that transmission occurred from the 76-year - old index patient to laboratory worker 1 , on the basis of b. melitensis dna found in the gram stain material .
early notification of exposed personnel could lead to their timely diagnosis and treatment , should symptoms occur , and could prevent further laboratory exposures .
because of immigration and foreign travel , brucellosis remains an occupational hazard for laboratory personnel , even in industrialized countries where animal control efforts have virtually eliminated the disease . because of the nonspecific symptoms and the rarity of the disease in the united states , healthcare providers may not consider brucellosis in a differential diagnosis .
