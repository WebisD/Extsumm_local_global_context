splenic abscess is a very rare complication of nontyphoidal salmonella infections since the presence of antibiotics . here
a 63-year - old woman from eastern part of turkey was admitted with the complaint of back pain , vomiting and nausea since 20 days .
after isolation of the s. enteritidis from abscess , the patient was questioned in detail , it was learned that the patient had diarrhoea and fever existed 2 days and recovered without antibiotic treatment one month ago .
nontyphoidal salmonella species are important food borne pathogens and acute gastroenteritis is the most common clinical manifestation accounting for about 70% of cases .
salmonella enteritidis was yielded from culture of the samples of the abscess obtained during the operation .
an abdominal ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic cystic structure with a diameter of 6172 mm in the upper part of the spleen with calcifications ( figure 1 ) .
we preferred splenectomy for treatment as the causative microorganism was not known initially . in conclusion , although non - typhoidal salmonella gastroenteritis is rarely resulted with splenic abscess , patients with comorbities are at increased risk .
it was sensitive to ampicillin , cotrimoxazole , cephalosporins of third generation , and ciprofloxacin .
