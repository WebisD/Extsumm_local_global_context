accordingly , this study aimed to investigate the effect of the use of a trekking pole on 
 muscle and cartilage damage and fatigue during downhill walking .
in addition , in trial np , the serum ck , serum ldh , and serum comp levels were 
 significantly increased at 2hpw when compared with those at the pwb ( p<0.05 ) .
the study specifically 
 examined obese women who had less muscle mass than men and whose heavy weights were likely 
 to increase the burden on their lower limb muscles and joints during walking .
np : no trekking pole trial ; tp : trekking pole trial ; 
 pwb : pre - walking baseline ; iaw : immediately after walking ; 2hpw : 2 hours post - walking ; 
 * p<0.05 vs. pwb .. the serum ck , serum ldh , serum comp , and plasma lactate levels were 
 significantly increased iaw when compared with those at the pwb in trials np and tp 
 ( p<0.05 ) .
downhill walking can cause muscle and cartilage damage , and it is suggested 
 that the use of a trekking pole can reduce temporary muscle and cartilage damage after 
 downhill walking .
this study 
 measured the levels of serum ck , ldh , and comp to investigate the effect of the use of a 
 trekking pole on muscle and cartilage damage during downhill walking .
