it is rare for an acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) to occur without angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis .
possible mechanisms for such an event include coronary artery spasm , coronary embolism from an intracardiac or paradoxical ( venous ) source , thrombosis caused by hypercoagulable states , and inflammation in response to specific infectious agents.1 ) paclitaxel has been associated with acute myocardial infarction.2 ) we report a case of coronary artery thrombosis associated with paclitaxel in advanced ovarian malignancy .
a 63-year - old woman was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis . a large left ovarian mass and omental cake with a large volume of ascites were noted on pelvic computed tomography ( ct ) , and through positron emission tomography ( pet ) , f - fluorodeoxyglucose ( f - fdg ) uptake was noted in the left ovarian mass and omental cake .
it has been seen that paclitaxel can disturb cardiac rhythm and cause cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction.2)4 ) myocardial infarction associated with paclitaxel therapy has been reported in some patients.2)5 ) in one of these patients , a 70% lesion with a fresh thrombus in the infarct - related artery was documented at autopsy.2 ) to date , the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction associated with paclitaxel is not known .
