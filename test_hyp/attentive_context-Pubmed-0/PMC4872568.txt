a total number of 39 patients with inequal leg length and dysplasia of the hip and 43 normal subjects who had visited the outpatient clinic orthopedic and neurosurgical department for lbp treatment between january 2012 and july 2013 were retrospectively analysed .
occurrence of disc herniation is statistically different between patients with short leg and controls ( p < 0.05 ) .
short extremity length and lumbar disc herniation ( ldh ) ( 24 versus 15 ) were more prominent on the right than the left side ( p = 0,663 ) .
the type of disc hernias were as follows : no disc in nine cases ( 23.07% ) , bulging in 20 cases ( 51.2% ) protrusion in eight cases ( 20.5% ) , extrusion in two cases ( 5,1% ) .
our study suggests that ldh may implicate abnormal loading due to leg length discrepancy rather than motion as the primary source of pain . a coronal imbalance of the spine is usually noted in patients with leg length discrepancy , however , the disc herniation secondary to leg length discrepancy has not been well - documented in humans .
shows disc herniation in patients with hip dysplasia and control groups inequality in leg length and severity of lumbar disc crosstabulation was shown
