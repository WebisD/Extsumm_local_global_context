our objective was to characterize these patients with kss in terms of their demographic characteristics , presenting signs and symptoms , diagnostic features , clinical evolution , and associations between disease features and the development of disability .
in addition to the conduction system abnormalities that were identified in previous series , our cohort included patients with syncope and sudden cardiac death , which underscores the need to consider formal electrophysiologic studies and prophylactic defibrillators in these patients .
associations between severity of kss ( ambulatory versus [ vs ] use of gait aid or wheelchair ) and patient characteristics ( sex and confirmation of kss diagnosis ) , presence of a genetic mutation , presence of a muscle defect on biopsy , presence of deafness , presence of cognitive decline , and death were determined using a two - tailed fisher s exact text .
kearns  sayre syndrome ( kss ) is a rare mitochondrial cytopathy , first described at mayo clinic in 1958.1 kss belongs to a group of mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) deletion syndromes that also includes pearson syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia ( peo).2 classically , kss has a triad of features , including presence of peo , pigmentary retinopathy , and an age of onset younger than 20 years.1,3,4 additionally , one or more of the following features must be present to make the diagnosis of kss : 1 ) heart block , 2 ) cerebellar ataxia , or 3 ) increased cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) protein level ( > 100 mg / dl).1,3,4 patients with peo who meet some , but not all , of the criteria for kss have been termed as having  kss minus  or
