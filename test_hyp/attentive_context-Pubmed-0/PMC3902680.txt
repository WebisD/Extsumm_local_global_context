the present study has shown s. pneumoniae as the most likely pathogen and either linezolid or amikacin as the most likely effective antimicrobial in cases of cap , in our setting . keeping the idsa and cdc recommendations in mind
the present study is an attempt to identify and delineate the microbiological and antimicrobial sensitivity characteristics of cap in a given community and hospital setting .
incidence of etiological organisms of cap , with gender distribution pie diagram showing the aetiological pathogens isolated from the sputum of cap patients in this study incidence of etiological organisms of cap , with age distribution the different antimicrobial agents included in this study are mentioned in annexure 1 .
the study was conducted for dissertation purpose at lourdes hospital , ernakulam which is a 750 bedded multispecialty referral hospital catering to both urban and semi - urban population .
bar diagram showing the antimicrobial sensitivity of the most common pathogen in this study ( streptococcus pneumoniae ) the rates of sensitivity to these antimicrobial agents shown by all the pathogens taken together are represented in terms of percentage [ figure 3 ] . here
community acquired pneumonia ( cap ) is defined as an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that is associated with at least some symptoms of acute infection , accompanied by the presence of an acute infiltrate on a chest radiograph or auscultatory findings consistent with pneumonia , in a patient not hospitalized or residing in a long - term care facility for 14 days before the onset of symptoms . in the absence of a chest x - ray ,
