, masc could be a molecularly well - defined salivary gland neoplasm , encompassing some portions of acicc and anos , but its histological spectrum and clinical implication need further investigation .
dog1 , known as a novel marker of salivary acinar and intercalated duct differentiation , was not helpful.10 gcdfp-15 , er , and pr were considered a possibility due to their mammary - like character , but were not expressed in masc .
57.65% of examined cells showed a split signal with etv6 translocation ( masc ) in 13 cases , while 9.55% of examined cells showed a split signal in 10 cases with intact etv6 ( mimic masc ) .
the percentage of cells with a split signal ranged between 20.75% and 78.57% in cases with etv6 translocation , and between 3.10% and 12.96% in cases with intact etv6 .
the s100 protein was highly sensitive , but showed low specificity to differentiate masc from mimic masc .
in this study we investigated the new salivary gland tumor , known as masc , to clarify the clinical , histological , and immunohistochemical characteristics , and to determine any pathognomonic features helpful in diagnosing mascs .
the present study compared masc candidate groups with an intact etv6 and etv6 translocation . to evaluate mascs with an emphasis on easy identification of specific characteristics , consideration of the ideal cut - off value to assess the etv6 fish results was necessary . in this study ,
