therefore , prevention seems to be more effective strategy in the next pregnancy for this family and other families with positive history .
hoshmand et al presented a novel mutation in the smpd1 gene ( data not published ) . here , we present the first molecular genetics diagnosis of npa in an individual from southwest iran .
the present observations extend the mutation spectrum of the smpd1 gene in npa patients worldwide , and can be used for the prenatal or preimplatation genetic diagnosis , at least in southwest iran .
because of variations in pathological and clinical features of the disease , npd is classified into those with deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase activity ( types a and b ) , and those with defective intracellular processing and transporting of ldl cholesterol , which is known as type c. however , npd type c ( npc ) is different at the biochemical and molecular levels with a higher incidence than npa and npb . both types
to our knowledge by intensive literature searching , the present report demonstrates firstly the molecular genetics diagnosis of the npd in southwest iran . approximately 1 per 40,000 people of ashkenazi jewish descent has npa .
