the use of green tea as an endodontic irrigant can be helpful , since it is a biocompatible antioxidant and lacks the serious risks associated with the use of sodium hypochlorite .
, cost - effectiveness , long shelf life , low toxicity and the lack of microbial resistance , we sought to examine antifungal effects of green tea as an irrigant against biofilms formed by c. albicans on extracted teeth .
preclinical and clinical trials are recommended for evaluating its safety and biocompatibility before its use as an intracanal irrigating solution in the clinical setting .
antifungal activity of green tea was found to be time - dependent and its inhibitory action increased over time . within 15 minutes of exposure of c. albicans to green tea ,
mic90 of green tea extract was 0.625 mg / ml after 24 hours and its mfc was 1.25 mg / ml after 24 hours . mic90 and mfc of tested solutions against c. albicans the statistical results showed that the effects of material and time and the interaction effect of material and time were all significant ( all ps<0.01 , table 2 ) .
comparison of the mean number of colonies in nine groups using duncan s post - hoc test showed that the lowest number of colonies was grown in sodium hypochlorite and then in green tea extract group after 15 minutes of exposure ( p<0.01 ) ; the difference between these experimental groups was not statistically significant ( p>0.05 ) .
