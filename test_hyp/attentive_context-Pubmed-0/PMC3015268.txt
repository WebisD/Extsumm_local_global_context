we present a case of a cardiac transplant candidate with an ejection fraction of less than 15% who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
we conclude that if a patient with congestive heart failure is medically optimized , and intra - abdominal pressures and surgical times are minimized , laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be performed with minimal risk to the patient .
the patient underwent the procedure while measurements were made at crucial intervals ( baseline , with incremental insufflation , reverse trendelenberg , at desufflation ) using a pulmonary artery catheter , transesophageal echocardiography with fractional area measurements , radial arterial line , as well as standard monitoring .
this is the first case in which intraoperative hemodynamic measurements were recorded in a patient with cardiopulmonary disease this severe .
there was a rise in mean arterial and systemic vascular resistance with insufflation to 10 mm hg , which was further exaggerated by reverse trendelenberg .
we conclude from this case that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely in patients with severe cardiac disease and ejection fractions less than 20% . under these circumstances it is imperative that appropriate monitoring be utilized , and iap , reverse trendelenburg and surgical time minimized .
