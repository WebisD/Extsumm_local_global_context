statins or 3-hydroxy - methylglutaryl coenzyme - a ( hmg - coa ) reductase inhibitors are a potent class of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors and an established therapy for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery diseases .
the pathophysiological implications of blockade of mevalonate production in the pathway leading to synthesis of cholesterol , that is , the mevalonate pathway suggested multiple mechanisms of statins . over the years , analyses of several clinical studies , including the landmark hps and ascot - lla trial , reported findings with statins that were inexplicable with the lipid - lowering mechanism alone .
the most probable mechanism of statin pleiotropy is prevention of isoprenoids synthesis as decrease in levels of circulating isoprenoids have been reported with treatment with statins .
later several other studies such as the cholesterol treatment trialists meta - analyses , the treating to new target , heart progression study ( hps ) , cholesterol and recurrent events ( care ) trial and long - term intervention with pravastatin in ischaemic disease ( lipid ) studies also confirmed the findings of 4s . accumulating evidence have suggested that statins , in addition to ldl - c lowering , exhibited properties of plaque stabilization and endothelial homeostasis ; anti - inflammatory , antioxidant , anti - proliferative and immunomodulatory effects ; normalization of sympathetic outflow ; and prevention of platelet aggregation .
