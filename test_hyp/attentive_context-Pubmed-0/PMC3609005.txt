the aims of this study are to investigate the rate of ho at a longer follow - up ( mean 3 years ) , to determine if the presence of ho negatively affects functional outcome and to identify factors that may precipitate the formation of ho following cervical disc arthroplasty .
what is the incidence of ho following cervical arthroplasty ? does the development of ho negatively influence the clinical outcome in patients receiving arthroplasty ?
maintenance of motion following arthroplasty can be hindered by the development of heterotopic ossification ( ho ) , whose causes remain uncertain.1,2,3,4,5 whether the formation of ho following cervical disc arthroplasty is of clinical or functional importance is also unknown .
inclusion criteria : patients suffering from radiculopathy , myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy secondary to soft disc hernia and/or mild degree spondylosis operated between october 2004 and december 2006 .
among the 16 patients with ho , 15 ( 93.8% ) demonstrated a range of motion 3 ( fig .
the following distribution of prostheses / level was recorded : c34:5 ; c45:4 ; c56:23 ; c67:13 ( table 2 ) . the incidence rate of ho using the number of prostheses as the denominator was 42.2% ( 19 levels in 16 patients , fig .
