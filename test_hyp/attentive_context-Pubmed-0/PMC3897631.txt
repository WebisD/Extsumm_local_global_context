we recommend measuring prostate volume by using trus in selected patients with aggravated bph symptoms or a high psa level .
therefore , in the present study , we analyzed the changes in luts , prostate volume , and psa level after discontinuation of 5ari .
our study showed that withdrawal of 5ari during combination therapy resulted in prostate regrowth and deterioration of luts .
from december 2003 to december 2012 , 81 men more than 40 years of age with moderate to severe bph symptoms as determined by the international prostate symptom score ( ipss8 ) and a prostate volume of greater than 25 cm measured by transrectal ultrasonography ( trus ) were collected retrospectively for the study .
the psa level had decreased by 48.4% ( from 3.30 ng / ml [ sd , 2.09 ] to 1.75 ng / ml [ sd , 1.33 ] ; p<0.001 ) in group 1 and by 49.4% ( from 2.67 ng / ml [ sd , 1.82 ] to 1.35 ng / ml [ sd , 0.92 ] ; p<0.001 ) in group 2 .
however , 1 year after discontinuation of dutasteride , the psa level had increased up to 108.2% of the baseline level ( from 1.35 ng / ml [ sd , 0.92 ] to 2.89 ng / ml [ sd , 2.10 ] ; p<0.001 ) in group 2 ( fig .
