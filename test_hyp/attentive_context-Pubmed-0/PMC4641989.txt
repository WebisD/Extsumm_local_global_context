in addition , we attempted to evaluate the ablation rate of remnant thyroid by compliance of the lid .
low adherence to the lid guideline with more than 100 g / d of dietary iodine intake level negatively influenced the efficacy of rai therapy .
all three patients showed low adherence to the lid guideline , in particular for salted vegetable and exhibited remnant thyroid activity in the second post - rai therapy scan .
urinary iodine excretion is a good measure for dietary iodine intake , but evaluating the dietary iodine intake using multiple days of dietary records would provide a more comprehensive measure of dietary iodine intake in order to develop a practical dietary strategy for the lid . therefore , this study aims to assess dietary iodine level using three - day of dietary records and to search food sources that cause low adherence to the lid .
we experienced three patients showing the diet composing iodine levels over 100 g / day despite their efforts for the lid before initial rai therapy .
though serum off - tg levels became undetectable ( < 1.0 ng / ml ) for patients 1 and 2 , patient 3 's off - tg level was 1.07 ng / ml and all three patients showed visible rai uptake .
