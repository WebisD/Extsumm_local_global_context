this study , for the first time , shows that the silicone , flexi - plate ahmed valve can be effectively implanted in eyes with a preexisting episcleral encircling element keeping in mind the possibility of significant postoperative complications .
the postoperative reduction in iop and in number of antiglaucoma medications was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 , paired t - test ) .
the mean preoperative iop was 31.4 ( 7.9 ) mmhg ; median , 32mmhg with an average of 2.8 ; median , 3 medications . at last postoperative follow - up , the mean iop decreased to 12.5 ( 3.5 ) mmhg
the mean follow - up was 37.4 ( 22.9 ) weeks ; median , 33.5 weeks .
the mean ( standard deviation ) duration between placement of episcleral encircling element and implantation of agv was 30.5 ( 33.8 ) months ; median , 11.5 months .
the mean duration between placement of agv and corneal graft failure was 7.3 ( 5.3 ) months ; median , 8.5 months .
demographic / pre - operative data corneal graft failure occurred in three eyes in late postoperative period following implantation of agv ( cases 4 , 7 , 9 ) . in one of these eyes , the agv tube was placed in the pars plana region . in the remaining two eyes ,
