linear regression analysis of hgi versus mbgi for all 202 patients showed that mbgi ( the mean difference between eag and mbg ) for individual patients was significantly positively correlated with mean hgi { mbgi ( mg / dl ) = [ 28.7  hgi ( % ) ] + 1.9 , r = 0.91 , p < 0.0001}. disagreement between eag and mbg .
the present analysis used a1c from that study to calculate mean eag for the low , moderate , and high hgi groups , respectively , which were : 163  20 , 193  19 , and 230  31 mg / dl .
the adag study concluded that a1c could be reliably translated into eag based on the linear relationship between a1c and mean blood glucose measured by continuous glucose monitoring in a mixed population of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects ( 1 ) .
in our original description of this study population ( 14 ) we reported that the mean  sd values of glycemic variables for the low- , moderate- , and high - hgi groups , respectively , were : mbg , 186  31 , 195  28 , and 199  42 mg / dl ; a1c , 7.6  0.7 , 8.4  0.7 , and 9.6  1.1% ; and hgi , 1.0  0.4 , 0.1  0.2 , and 1.1  0.9% .
