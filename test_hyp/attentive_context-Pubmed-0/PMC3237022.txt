this involved analysis of the digested peptides using a maldi tof - tof mass spectrometer . in our study , both gel - based lc - ms / ms and gel - free multidimensional protein identification technology ( mudpit ) analyses were used to identify proteins from b. vietnamiensis . by combining both methods ,
this method involved two types of hplc separation , namely , strong cation exchange ( scx ) followed by reverse phase separation .
the main objectives of the present experiments are to achieve high coverage of the opportunistic pathogen burkholderia   vietnamiensis g4 proteome expressed in a minimal medium and to identify the expressed proteins , including low abundance virulence factors , using mass spectrometry .
gel - based and gel - free proteomics which have been used to identify proteins from many sources including pathogenic bacteria , cancer cells , and different tissue types were used . for the gel - based approach , a 1d gel separation and lc - ms / ms analysis
minimal media and late log phase collection were chosen to favor enhanced production of virulence factors and to provide a 
proteins from b. vietnamiensis grown in mineral salt medium , with 2% glucose as the carbon source , were fractionated into 4 different fractions , extracellular ; intracellular ; cell surface , and cell wall proteins . by combining both gel - based and gel - free proteomic analysis data ,
