a small subset of patients with chronic total occlusion of the middle cerebral artery ( mca ) are refractory to medical treatment due to inadequate collateral circulation.1 surgical revascularization with extracranial to intracranial bypass has been the mainstay of treatment but its efficacy remains controversial.2 development of new endovascular devices and improved operator experience have rendered angioplasty and stenting a potential treatment option for such patients . in these case reports , we illustrate the feasibility of elective ( at least 1  month after the ischemic event ) endovascular recanalization for symptomatic mca occlusion by angioplasty and stenting , and the long term outcome .
a 43-year - old male smoker with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented with a 2-month history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks ( tia ) of left - sided weakness .
further studies are needed to determine its efficacy in carefully selected patients with medically refractory cerebral ischemia due to mca occlusion .
direct stenting of chronic total occlusion of the mca is technically feasible but not without the potential for major complications .
chronic mca occlusion as a cause of hemodynamic ischemic stroke is not a prominent clinical issue worldwide.1 while acute occlusion of the mca is commonly caused by an embolic thrombus,3 
 4 atherosclerotic occlusion of the intracranial arteries is more prevalent in asians .
