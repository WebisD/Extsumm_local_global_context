the elimination half time of thymoglobulin is 2 - 3 days and is 
 unlikely that its effect on plasma cell is sustained for a year . in 
 conclusion , this case demonstrates that monoclonal gammopathy can be associated 
 with chronic hepatitis b infection and can be eliminated after successful 
 transplantation .
sd , a 45-year - old caucasian male , was referred for evaluation for liver 
 transplantation because 
 of end - stage liver disease caused by hepatitis b. he had 
 been well until six months prior to his initial visit , when he started losing 
 weight and developed severe fatigue . during the six - month period , he had lost 
 25 kilograms .
there is very little data and uncertainty regarding the incidence and natural history of 
 m proteins in a person with hepatitis b. it has been suggested that the immunological response elicited against hepatitis 
 b virus in the host rather than the direct cytopathic effect of the virus may 
 be the basis for the pathogenesis of hepatic and nonhepatic manifestations .
it was clear that the patient had 
 progressive liver disease from chronic hepatitis b with a relatively high meld 
 score of 23 , and he would benefit from a liver transplantation .
