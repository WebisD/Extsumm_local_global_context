after several decades of cancer research , some details of the underlying mechanisms of cancer at the gene level are still unclear . in this paper , we propose an integrative method based on the bootstrapping k - s test to evaluate a large number of microarray datasets generated from 21 different types of cancer in order to identify gene pairs that have different relationships in normal versus cancer tissues .
the significant alteration of gene relations can greatly extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human cancer . in our method , we obviate the disadvantage of the traditional t - test , which only considers the mean and variance of samples and fails in the analysis of microarray data with small numbers of samples . instead of the t - test , we propose the use of the bootstrapping k - s test method to detect gene pairs with different distributions of pearson correlation coefficient values in normal and tumor samples .
the experimental results demonstrated that our method could find meaningful alterations in gene relations and opened a potential door for further cancer research .
, we propose a novel method to detect the differentially changed gene relations in cancer versus normal tissues .
