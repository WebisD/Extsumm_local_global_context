the best action to treat corneal disorder is a replacement of the damaged recipient cornea ( complete / partial ) with a healthy donor corneal tissue .
further research is showing promising results with ek using thinner tissues and an expected long - term visual outcomes and graft stability   .
corneal lamellar keratoplasty ( lk ) is a surgical technique that allows preserving healthy portions of the cornea while selectively replacing the dysfunctional segments .
hence , the intention should be to achieve an easy , efficient , and a validated procedure for dmek surgery .
deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( dalk ) is a surgical technique that is considered the best for treating the patients with anterior layer ( epithelium , bowman 's layer , and stroma ) disorders .
the above mentioned surgeries have enlarged the view of corneal surgery by achieving higher visual outcomes as compared to pk while limiting the rate of rejection and increasing the long - term graft stability .
thus , we envision that standardizing the posterior lamellar graft preparation methods will reduce unnecessary manipulation of the tissue in the operating theatre and reduce the high surgical skill or risk quotient . in the near future , the deg could be supplied as pre - cut tissues which would reduce the overall intervention costs and save time .
