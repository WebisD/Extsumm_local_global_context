alterations in the influence of inhibitory gabaergic circuits can have a profound   impact on the excitability of neural network function , and have been associated with hyperexcitable conditions such as epilepsy   .
therefore , following chronic reductions in network activity ( figure 1 left ) , we would expect compensatory weakening of both gabaergic synapses on excitatory neurons and glutamatergic synapses on inhibitory neurons and to see reductions in the intrinsic cellular excitability of inhibitory neurons .
if network activity is increased for days ( figure 1 right ) , we would expect compensatory strengthening of both gabaergic synapses on excitatory neurons and glutamatergic synapses on inhibitory neurons and to observe increases in the intrinsic cellular excitability of inhibitory neurons .
recent work has identified what may be one of the most important processes in ensuring that networks maintain appropriate activity levels ; homeostatic plasticity is thought to maintain network spiking activity levels within a physiologically relevant range through compensatory adjustments in intrinsic cellular excitability , as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength   .
it will be important to identify common mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity , but it is likely that different preparations   ( e.g. , in vitro versus in vivo ) and different neural circuits use different homeostatic mechanisms .
