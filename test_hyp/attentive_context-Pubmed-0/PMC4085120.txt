synchronization of kinematic measurements with the measurement of vertical components of ground reaction forces in the landing phase during this stage of the study allowed us to identify impact loads on the locomotor apparatus of the studied dancers and to forecast methods for minimizing such loads .
these training methods would be aimed preventing injury and physical overload , as well as increasing dancers knowledge of biomechanics and kinesiology of the locomotor apparatus in dancing .
this purpose , a mathematical model of lower limb movement will be prepared , allowing us to determine the forces generated by muscles and the forces transmitted by joint surfaces .
the conducted kinematic analysis consisted in establishing such characteristic parameters as trajectories of joint centers and movement sequences of lower limbs , pelvis movement , angle changes in hip , knee , and ankle joints in the sagittal plane , as well as changes of foot position in relation to the ground .
the rom in the hip joint is 50 for the female and 36 for the male . in the knee joint ( figure 8) ,
, the results of these measurements will be used to determine loads transmitted by musculoskeletal system when performing dancing movements . for
