in our experience , adding ral to a cart regimen was useful in rapidly reducing hiv-1 vl to prevent perinatal transmission in women who have high vl or suboptimal suppression late in pregnancy . our findings are consistent with previously published cases of ral use late in pregnancy , which are summarized in table 2 ( 8,1518,2022,2426,28 ) . among these ,
our findings support the consideration of the use of ral to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission in late - presenting hiv - infected pregnant women and in women with vl rebound near term . however , long - term data are needed to assess the impact of ral use for short - term therapy in the obstetrical setting on the resistance profile . indeed , there is a legitimate concern about the effectiveness of future ral - based regimens .
further research needs to be performed to understand the role of ral in women with hiv acquisition in pregnancy , who are at even higher risk for perinatal transmission .
the results of two ongoing clinical trials ( nct01854762 and nct01618305 ) will help to assess advantages of ral compared with other antiretrovirals in pregnancy .
we were able to confirm the drastic and rapid decrease of hiv vl after ral initiation , and computed a median time to achieve vl < 1000 copies / ml ( eight days ) , information that will be useful in the clinical setting .
