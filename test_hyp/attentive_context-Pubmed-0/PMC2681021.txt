based on these findings , naturally occurring episodes of acute hypo- and hyperglycemia during daily routine can be associated with cognitive - motor disruptions in school - aged children with diabetes . to our knowledge , this is the first study comparing the negative impact of hypo- and hyperglycemia on cognitive function in this pediatric population .
this finding replicates results from adult studies ( 2,3 ) and adds to the data suggesting that the initial effect of blood glucose extremes is a decrease in mental efficiency and speed and not a decrease in accuracy .
for the math task , average ratings were 0.44 , 0.77 , and 0.58 for euglycemia , hypoglycemia , and hyperglycemia , respectively , with a significant main effect across blood glucose levels ( f = 4.3 , p < 0.0001 ) .
this study found large individual differences in degree of impairment at different blood glucose levels , and there are likely numerous , unidentified variables that influence the impact of an episode of acute hyperglycemia on cognitive function .
number of severe hypoglycemic episodes over the past year correlated with impairment scores for both math time ( r = 0.39 , p = 0.04 ) and reaction time ( r = 0.40 , p = 0.02 ) when blood glucose was > 22.2
