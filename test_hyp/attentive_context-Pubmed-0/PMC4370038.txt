kars seems to cause less postoperative pain during the management of benign ovarian cysts in comparison with conventional multiport co2 laparoscopy .
in addition , postoperative shoulder pain seems to be more frequently observed after laparoscopic surgical procedures in which the intra - abdominal pressure is elevated to between 12 and 18 mm hg by use of co2 . in this study we aimed to compare the postoperative pain levels for kars and conventional multiport laparoscopy performed for adnexal cysts .
most of the intraoperative and postoperative findings were similar in the 2 groups ( p > .05 ) ; however , the abdominal cavity access and total operative times in the kars group were significantly longer than those in the conventional laparoscopy group ( p < .05 ) .
in addition , the women in the kars group needed less additional analgesia in comparison with those in the conventional laparoscopy group ( p < .05 ) .
moreover , a higher number and percentage of the patients in the conventional co2 laparoscopy group had shoulder pain ( p < .05 ) .
the vas pain scores at the beginning and second , fourth , and 24th hours of the postoperative period were significantly lower in the kars group ( p < .05 ) , although the differences in mean vas scores never exceeded 1 point .
