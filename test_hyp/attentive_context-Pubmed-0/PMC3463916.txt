the objective of our study was to determine how maternal physical activity , maternal insulin sensitivity ( isogtt ) , prepregnancy bmi , infant feeding practices ( breastfeeding duration , age of introduction of formula , and complementary foods ) , and screen time contribute to infant weight gain and adiposity at 1 year of age .
longitudinal followup of these children will examine the effects of maternal and infant factors on bmi and adiposity in early childhood beyond 1 year of age .
weight gain from birth to 1 year was negatively predicted by infant female sex , maternal pregravid vigorous / sport activity , and exclusive breastfeeding duration and positively predicted by infant age at time of 1 year visit .
weight - for - length z - score at 1 year was negatively predicted by maternal pregravid vigorous / sport activity and exclusive breastfeeding duration and positively predicted by birth weight , infant age at time of 1 year visit , and maternal prepregnancy bmi .
the mean pregravid vigorous / sport index in our study was 2.4 , which suggests that 1530  min of walking or cycling per day   in mothers prior to pregnancy may be beneficial for decreasing obesity risk of offspring .
