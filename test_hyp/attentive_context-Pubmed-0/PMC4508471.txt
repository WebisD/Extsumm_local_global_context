based on these results it is concluded as follows.waste of shells crabs ( portunus pelagicus ) proved to be used as raw material for the synthesis of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 due to high calcium levels which amounted to 66.62% in addition to the abundant existence as waste.the optimum temperature formation of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 is at 800c.ca10(po4)6(oh)2 were synthesized from waste of shell crabs ( portunus pelagicus ) in vitro effectively inhibiting the rate of demineralization of the tooth where the greater the addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 in the solution , the more the inhibiting demineralization of the tooth or the smaller the rate of tooth demineralization in solution .
