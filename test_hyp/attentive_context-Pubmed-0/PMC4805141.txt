, every single bioactive constituent of propolis needs to be studied to show the source of real effects and the molecular mechanisms of this effects .
we published a review article about toxicities of some therapeutic compounds and the protective effect of cape on chemotherapy- and radiotherapy - induced toxicity .
caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( cape ) [ figure 1 ] is one of important compounds found in propolis that has antiviral , antioxidant , anti - inflammatory , antiproliferative , antitumor , and immunomodulatory effects .
this marvelous compound has been used to prevent oxidative stress - based deterioration in cells / tissues / organs in both cell culture and experimental animals . lately ,
as a conclusion , studying propolis to prevent cp - induced oxidative stress in animals has several limitations since the proposed effect can not be specified to one or several molecules within the mixture . in that case
it throws light on the side effects of a common anticancer agent , cp , used in the treatment of various malignancies and possible remedies to prevent that type of side effects in vital organs such as liver and kidney .
the protection of cape on central and peripheral nervous system as well as a reproductive system have been extensively reviewed [ 3 - 5 ] .
