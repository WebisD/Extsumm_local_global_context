microglandular adenosis ( mga ) is a rare benign disease that causes proliferative glandular lesions in the breast .
case 1 was a 44-year - old woman with a previous history of breast - conserving surgery because of ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) in her right breast 4 years ago . after breast - conserving surgery
these benign lesions may progress to a wide spectrum of disease , from atypical microglandular adenosis ( amga ) to carcinoma arising in microglandular adenosis ( camga ) .
although mga itself is benign , it can cause carcinoma , which can lead to problems if not excised completely . in this study
to the best of our knowledge , the present cases are the first cases of invasive carcinoma arising in mga to be reported in korea .
incomplete excision of a primary benign mga lesion can cause recurrence of mga with development of carcinoma .
in addition to surgery , radiation therapy should be considered in patients with breast - conserving surgery , and adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered in patients with axillary metastasis or with invasive tumors larger than 1 cm in the absence of nodal metastasis . despite histopathological and ihc features indicating poor prognoses ,
