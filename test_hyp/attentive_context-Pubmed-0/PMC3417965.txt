high - risk vascular surgery patients , including those with thrombotic disorders , present safety and technical challenges for anesthetic management . given the poor tolerance of these patients to hemodynamic perturbations , the safest methods should be considered for surgical anesthesia.1 the factor v leiden ( fvl ) mutation , a single point mutation that confers factor v resistance to protein c degradation , is the most common genetic cause of thrombophilia.2 in this case report , we discuss the successful use of infraclavicular brachial plexus , thoracic paravertebral , and unilateral subarachnoid blocks for a patient with fvl mutation and left axillary artery occlusion .
a 58-year - old , 76 kg , 162 cm tall , american society of anesthesiologists ( asa ) physical status ii woman was scheduled for axillo - brachial bypass to treat left axillary artery occlusion ( subclavian steal syndrome ) .
the surgeon planned to harvest the patient s left distal saphenous vein for axillo - brachial bypass .
this approach was also chosen in this patient with an fvl mutation because regional anesthesia is associated with a lower risk of thrombosis compared to general anesthesia.7 although we chose an infraclavicular block for arm anesthesia , we performed sensorial blockade of the axillary region using a tpvb at the t1 , t2 , and t3 levels.8 tpvb can be performed with the patient sitting , lying on the side , or prone .
