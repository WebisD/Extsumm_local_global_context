a 17 year old girl presented with swelling of ankle and pain while walking for six months .
giant cell tumour of long bones are common but those involving the distal fibula are exceedingly rare .
radiographs were suggestive of a giant cell tumour , computerised tomography revealed cortical break , en block resection was done with ipsilateral proximal fibula used in reconstruction of ankle mortise .
there are very few similar cases reported worldwide and it is the purpose of this report to describe the management of such a case .
the management of such tumours with high recurrence rates can be easily accomplished by en block resection and reconstruction of the ankle mortise with proximal fibula ensuring good range of motion of the joint post operatively .
giant cell tumour is the commonest benign bone tumour arising at the epiphyseometaphyseal regions of long bones . around the knee
giant cell tumour of long bones are common but those involving the distal fibula are exceedingly rare .
distal fibula gct being an extremely rare entity and its management not been described , reconstruction of ankle with proximal giant cell tumour of distal fibula are extremely rare and such benign tumours with high recurrence rates with the evidence of medial cortical break should be managed by an en block resection and reconstruction of the ankle mortise and the preferable method would be by the usage of proximal fibula graft .
