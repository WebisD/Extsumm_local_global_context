data from ontario reflect the sensitivity and specificity of this antigen - capture assay by using swab eluates in relation to the infection status ( taqman rt - pcr on kidney and brain ) of corvids .
in contrast , with the exception of 42 birds in which tissue samples were used to establish wnv infection status , the manitoba results evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the antigen - capture assay by using swab eluates in relation to the detection of virus in the same sample by taqman rt - pcr .
this procedure would compensate for the slightly lower specificity of the antigen - capture assay and should result in markedly decreased workloads for laboratories using molecular diagnostic procedures .
when this antigen - capture assay is used , only index cases of wnv infection in dead birds detected in a given jurisdiction such as a health unit or municipality need to be confirmed with rt - pcr assays before public notification of virus activity .
the sensitivity and specificity of the antigen - capture assay , when oropharyngeal swabs from crows collected in 2002 were used , were 83.3% and 95.8% , respectively , indicating that this assay is acceptable for use as a field detection test in a wnv surveillance program .
