compared to controls , in participants with ad , there was increased md ( percentage difference 12% ) , increased axd ( 9% ) and increased rd in temporal swm ( 14% ; table 2 ) .
the area of swm was smaller in participants with ad ( frontal swm : 5,576  4,556 vs. 1,119  517 , p = 0.00073 ; occipital swm : 1,627  1,211 vs. 316  155 , p = 0.00025 ; parietal swm : 3,652  2,747 vs. 687  161 , p = 0.00015 ; temporal swm : 2,083  1,706 vs. 391  227 , p = 0.00029 ) .
there were no statistically significant differences in the fa of swm between controls and participants with ad ( table 2 ) . among controls , in frontal swm , increased rd and decreased fa were associated with worse moca scores ( table 3 ) . in occipital swm , increased rd was associated with worse moca and trail scores , and decreased fa was associated with worse trail scores . in temporal swm , decreased fa was associated with worse moca scores , and increased md and rd were associated with worse stroop scores . in participants with ad , the fa , md , rd and axd of swm was not associated with the performance on the cognitive tests ( table 4 ) .
