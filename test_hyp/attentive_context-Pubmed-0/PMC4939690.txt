we report a case of a slow - growing early adenocarcinoma arising from a traditional serrated adenoma of the duodenum , which was diagnosed and treated by an endoscopic mucosal resection .
tsas of the duodenum should be radically excised , either endoscopically or surgically to rule out the possibility of a synchronously growing invasive adenocarcinoma or to prevent cancer progression . in conclusion , this present case distinctively showed a slow growth but had adenocarcinoma arising from serrated adenoma of the duodenum .
serrated polyps are now classified into 3 distinct types by histologic and genetic characteristics : hyperplastic polyp , sessile serrated adenoma , and transitional serrated adenoma ( tsa ) . a serrated adenoma is a precursor lesion for colorectal carcinoma ( crc ) .
a 66-year - old man with no significant medical history underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( egd ) for general examination ( fig .  1 ) .
it is consistent with other reports that serrated adenoma in the small bowel is more virulent than those in the colon .
serrated adenomas in the small intestine may represent a distinct morphological subtype of adenoma with a biological significance that is different from those in the colon and rectum . in the current case ,
