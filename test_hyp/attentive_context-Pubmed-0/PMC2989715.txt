, however , zimmerman and colleagues demonstrated that the predictors of bone density in nursing home patients were the same as for those living in the community , namely , age , gender , race , and weight .  
et al .   have shown , a fall onto the greater trochanter will generate enough force to break most if not all hip bones , and the real problem of hip fractures in ltc may well be the much more difficult one of falling and the way of falling , with osteoporosis simply determining where the hip will break , with those with thin bones more likely to suffer an intertrochanteric fracture than a subcapital fracture .
we have compared hip fracture rate in long - term care ( ltc ) and community - dwelling men and women at different age strata .
subsequently we corrected for age and gender distribution in the ltc setting to see what proportion of the excess rate of hip fracturing the different age and gender balance of the ltc population might account for . any remaining excess risk would point to an added risk factor , be it endogenous or exogenous to the patient , as important in increasing the hip fracture rate in these people .
