the present ipd meta - analysis aims to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of copd self - management interventions on relevant outcomes , including hrqol , hospitalization , and mortality , with a particular focus on identifying subgroups of patients with copd who are most likely to benefit from self - management interventions .
self - management interventions exert positive effects in patients with copd on respiratory - related and all - cause hospitalization and modest improvement of hrqol at 12 months , but do not show an effect on mortality .
with over 60 million people affected , copd is a major global health problem leading to substantial morbidity and mortality.1 in addition to the disease burden , copd requires a major shift in patients daily life as they need to adhere to drug treatment , implement lifestyle changes , monitor signs and symptoms , and apply decision making on early treatment of exacerbations to prevent complications.2 interventions to improve this self - management behavior in copd patients have been receiving increasing attention and generally involve patient education and teaching skills to patients for monitoring their condition , carrying out medical regimens , and changing their health behavior.3 a recent systematic review found positive effects on a range of outcomes , including health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) , dyspnea , and health care utilization.4 although the evidence favors self - management interventions , there seems to be a large heterogeneity in the effects of these interventions .
