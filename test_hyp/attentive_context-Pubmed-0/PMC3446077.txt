therefore this cross sectional study with new data was undertaken to assess the spectrum of hepatic involvement in children with dengue infection .
presence of fever , jaundice and hepatomegaly in endemic areas should arouse the suspicion of dengue hepatitis .
hepatic tenderness was observed in 36.3% of children , which was more in dhf ( 53.8% ) , dss ( 56% ) compared to df(20.3% ) group ( p=0.001 ) .
the spectrum of hepatic involvement in dengue varies from jaundice to elevation of liver enzymes .
the study group included 110 children aged between 2-mo-14 years satisfying the who criteria for dengue fever after excluding malaria , enteric fever , hepatitis a and hepatitis b. all 110 children were grouped into dengue fever ( df ) ( 53.6% ) , dhf ( 23.6% ) and dss ( 22.5% ) according to who criteria . the majority ( 76% ) were above 5 years .
79% had hepatomegaly which was noticed more in dhf and dss ( 88.5% and 96% ) than in df ( 67.8% ) group ( p=0.006 ) .
significant rise of liver enzymes helps in recognition of severe forms of dengue infection ( dhf and dss ) .
