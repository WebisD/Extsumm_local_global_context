chronic inflammatory status is associated with a number of clinically significant adverse patient outcomes , including malnutrition , peritoneal membrane dysfunction , and cardiovascular events .
inflammation is a common complication of pd patients at both systemic and local ( i.e. , intraperitoneal ) levels .
future studies should focus on better defining of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying peritoneal and systemic inflammatory cascade in pd patients and evaluating the efficacy of interventions targeting these identified factors .
although there are a number of potentially modifiable clinical causes of inflammation , a limited number of intervention studies to date have not been able to successfully identify effective strategies to lower inflammatory burden in this patient group .
the outcome of pd patients remains poor and cardiovascular events ( cve ) continue to be the leading cause of death in pd patients .

 peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) is a form of home - based renal replacement therapy for patients with end - stage kidney disease ( eskd ) that uses a patient 's peritoneum as a dialysis membrane across which water and solutes ( e.g. , electrolytes and glucose ) are exchanged between dialysis fluid and blood .
additional risks have been attributed to the presence of nontraditional risk factors , such as inflammation , which have been shown to promote proliferation and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the tunica intima of small arteries , leading to the development of atherosclerosis and stenosis .
