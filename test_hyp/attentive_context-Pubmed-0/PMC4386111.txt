langerhans cell histiocytosis ( lch ) refers to a clonal , neoplastic expansion of langerhans cells .
it is exceptional for lch to present with brain involvement as the sole presenting symptom .
this complication is reported as occurring in 14% of patients with multisystem disease , typically 520 years from the initial diagnosis .
once a diagnosis of lch is made , a brain biopsy is not essential if the mri appearances are typical for the inflammatory processes that accompany this condition .
brain imaging should always be undertaken in an older patient with episodes suggestive of seizures , diabetes insipidus of central origin or symptoms suggestive of pituitary dysfunction .
stimulation by tumor necrosis factor  and granulocyte - monocyte colony - stimulating factor has been implicated in the pathogenesis ( as has human herpesvirus 6 ) .
our patient 's episodes of hyperventilation followed by confusion are typical for seizures involving the right mesial temporal lobe ; the similarity to panic attacks has previously been identified in a case series .
ivig appears to be a reasonable adjunct to cladribine , particularly in a case such as this where cytopenias or infections limit the use of conventional chemotherapy .
