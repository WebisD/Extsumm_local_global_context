a 67-year - old man presented to a primary care skin cancer clinic in melbourne , australia for a routine six - month skin cancer examination . there was a long history of recreational sun exposure .
a search of the literature has not discovered any previously published dermatoscopy images of a microcystic adenexal carcinoma .
eccrine syringoid carcinoma , a rare malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor , should also be included in the differential diagnosis .
it is locally aggressive but rarely metastasizes , usually presenting as a slow growing asymptomatic lesion on the head and neck .
white clods of this pattern have also been observed in the more common adnexal skin tumor trichoepithelioma and may represent keratin retention cysts .
mac was first described as a separate clinical entity by goldstein et al in 1982 .
microcystic adenexal carcinoma is currently considered a rare tumor . however , such rarities will present more often as the world population increases in age and has increased access to modern medicine .
the two most notable dermatoscopic features of the lesion we present were the dense white structureless area centrally and the white clods of variable diameter peripherally .
