we report a case of imt of the urinary bladder in a 52-year - old male diagnosed by transurethral resection of the bladder tumor ( turbt ) treated by partial cystectomy .
it is important to distinguish this tumor from other malignant spindle cell tumors , such as the sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma and leiomyosarcoma .
however , in the case of recurrence when the tumor is not resectable , pharmacotherapy may become a viable therapeutic option . in conclusion ,
an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor ( imt ) is a distinctive neoplasm composed of myofibroblastic and fibroblastic spindle cells accompanied by inflammatory infiltration of plasma cells , lymphocytes , and eosinophils .
cystoscopy revealed a solitary nonpapillary tumor with surrounding edema at the dome of the bladder ( fig .
1a ) . enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed an early enhancing bladder tumor infiltrating the outside of the bladder muscle layer ( fig .
intraoperative findings showed a large solid bladder mass , measuring approximately 3 cm from the dome to the anterior wall of the bladder .
we also thought that the tumor was resectable by partial cystectomy and therefore decided against a course of pharmacotherapy .
