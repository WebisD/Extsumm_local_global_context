in a number of reviews on the induction of bone formation , we have often asked how bone differentiation by induction is initiated ? or how the soluble molecular signals of the transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) supergene family are deployed so as to initiate de novo bone formation by induction   ? somehow more simply but very confusing in a scenario of redundancy of multiple soluble molecular signals initiating bone differentiation by induction in the primate , which are the molecular signals that initiate de novo bone formation by induction   ? to be truthful , we have always assigned a prominent and pivotal role to the osteogenic proteins ( ops ) of the tgf- supergene family   .
the incorporation of specific biological activities into biomimetic biomaterial matrices by manipulating the geometry of the substratum , defined as  geometric induction of bone formation  is now helping to engineer therapeutic osteogenesis in clinical contexts .
continuum of molecular and morphological processes that ultimately results in significant amounts of bone formation by induction  in toto replacing the implanted 
this fundamental rule in molecular and cellular biology has now become the cardinal rule to initiate tissue morphogenesis after the molecular dissection of the fascinating phenomenon of  bone : formation by autoinduction , though regretfully not always completely understood .
