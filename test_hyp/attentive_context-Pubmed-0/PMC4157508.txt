a 26-year - old female patient was transferred to the samsung medical center from an outside institution due to severe refractory cardiogenic shock .
our strategy assures complete lv venting and allows for a simple conversion of p - ecls to paracorporeal lvad .
the reasons for our decision were complete lv support , possible longer - term support due to the absence of the oxygenator and the low level of anticoagulation , and the prevention of recurrent lv distension . on postoperative day 8 , we were able to wean the patient from lvad and remove all cannulas from her chest and groin .
. the other advantages of our strategy include prevention of recurrent lv distension and pulmonary edema . in summary ,
p - ecls offers excellent circulatory support in emergency settings and assures rapid and systemic perfusion .
currently , this patient is on the heart transplant list and is waiting for transplantation .
the effect of p - ecls on lv distension was investigated previously by some authors . in an animal model of acute heart failure ,
we report a case in which trans - sternal lv drainage was utilized while the patient was receiving p - ecls that was followed by a subsequent switch to paracorporeal lvad without further surgery .
