oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ad and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for ad .
plexus homogenates with different cases with ad in the different stages ( i/0 , iii - iv , and v - vi ) , we demonstrated that in ad patients , amyloid - beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl - lysine ( cml ) , and n - carboxyethyl - lysine ( cel ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired hdl - cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of ad .
recently , we described that pla2g3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical - generating xanthine / xanthine oxidase- ( x - xod- ) system - induced cell death , and that pla2g3 polymorphisms are associated with ad in a spanish case - control sample . in previous studies with choroid
future experiments that focus on the functional association of mitochondria with app and amyloid - beta might be useful for identifying mitochondrial drug targets .
