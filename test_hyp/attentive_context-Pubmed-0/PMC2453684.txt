nevertheless , the timing and rapid progression shown here suggest that excess glucagon secretion may represent a distinct therapeutic target early in the course of type 1 diabetes .
the magnitude of change was similar for both hormones ( 37% rise in glucagon vs. 45% decline in c - peptide auc over 12 months ) .
glucagon auc progressively increased over the 12-month observation period ( p = 0.0008 ) , whereas c - peptide auc progressively declined ( p < 0.0001 ) ( fig .
children with new - onset type 1 diabetes were recruited for a randomized , placebo - controlled trial of low - dose oral interferon- for preservation of -cell function ( the primary outcome of which will be published in a separate report ) .
subjects showed an increase in glucagon secretion following the mixed meal , with peak glucagon levels at 30 min ( fig .
of the 23 subjects , 18 ( 78% ) showed opposing changes in glucagon and c - peptide auc over time ( p = 0.01 ) .
mixed meal glucagon ( measured as a single value at 90 min ) from 1 to 12 months after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes . in the present study , we demonstrate a progressive , 37% rise in meal - stimulated glucagon secretion over 12 months after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes , paralleled by a 45% decline in c - peptide secretion .
