the aim of the study was therefore to determine whether hyposalivation is really a factor which enhances xerostomia , thirst and weight gain ( iwg ) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis .
additionally , hyposalivation was found to be associated with an elevated pre - dialysis sodium gradient , which serves to clarify the connection between decreased saliva production and excessive weight gain in patients on maintenance hemodialysis , as well as its underlying cause .
1the comparison of assessed parameters in subgroups and in pooled hd patients presented as a graph with logarithmic scale the comparison of assessed parameters in subgroups and in pooled hd patients presented as a graph with logarithmic scale in the hyposalivation group , pre - dialysis sodium serum gradient negatively correlated with saliva outflow (   =  0.61 , p  =  0.019 ) and positively with iwg (   =  0.49 , p  =  0.022 ) . in no - hyposalivation
a prospective trial was conducted in 111 maintenance hemodialysis patients ( 64 males and 47 females ) , mean age 59.1    13.6  years .
wiener et al .   determined the percentage of older adults with diagnosed hyposalivation ( uws  <  0.1  ml / min ) to be 12.1  % , which is over two times lower than in participants of our study , even though the population of older adults ( over 70  years old ) is susceptible to reduced saliva production related to certain medications and chronic conditions
