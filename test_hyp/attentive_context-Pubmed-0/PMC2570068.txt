an overarching societal goal is to understand animal and human intelligence and translate that knowledge into technology for prosthetic , assistive , and decision support applications .
one approach to growing human - like intelligence is to recapitulate the way in which children develop cognitive functions over the first several years of social experience .
developing tenable models to capture the essence of natural intelligence for real - time application requires that we discriminate features underlying information processing and intrinsic motivation from those reflecting biological constraints ( such as maintaining structural integrity and transporting metabolic products ) .
traditional research in this field considers the brain to be a specially adapted information - processing system , which can be modeled using mathematical optimization or production rule artificial intelligence systems . despite many decades of investment in such learning and classification systems
thus , taken together , advances in computer technology and interactive 3-d software have set the stage not only to facilitate supercomputer modeling of realistic brains , but also to promote acceptance by humans that virtual reality projections may be capable of meaningful cognitive interaction .
moreover , it is human - level cognition that we explore and seek to elucidate in our modeling and applications .
