the current study examined prospectively the evolution of gad symptoms in two groups of diagnosed patients in public and private mental healthcare settings ; one group according to the existing dsm - iv criteria and the other according to broader criteria ( at least 1 month but less than 6 months of excessive or non - excessive worry and 2 associated symptoms listed on dsm - iv for gad diagnosis ) . by using the total ham - a scores , changes in evolution of anxiety symptoms
, patients in both criteria groups improved their madrs scores with a mean reduction of 12.1 and 12.5 points for the dms - iv and broad criteria groups , respectively ( p=0.264 dsm - iv vs. broad criteria ) .
broadening criteria for gad diagnosis , by reducing excessive and non - excessive anxiety and worry duration to one month and the number of associated symptoms to two , captures a similar population of patients compared to the one identified by applying standard dsm - iv criteria .
moreover , the percentage of patients without symptoms of anxiety , showing ham - a<9 , increased up to 22.3% and 31.4% at the 3 month visit for the dsm - iv and broad criteria groups ( p<0.001 vs. basal visit in both groups , and p=0.006 between groups ) , and up to 49% and 58% at the 6 month visit ( p<0.001 vs. basal visit in both groups , and p=0.261 between groups ) , indicating similar results for both groups at the end of the study . also , patients responding to anxiety treatment increased when considering the responder criteria ( > 50% reduction of baseline scores ) ; 30.7% and 38.2% for the dms - iv and broad criteria , respectively , at the 3 months visit ( p= 0.004 ) ; increasing up to 59.7% in the dms - iv and 67.7% at the 6 month visit ( p=0.103 ) .
