 anal carcinoma is increasingly diagnosed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , anoreceptive intercourse , chronic inflammatory bowel disease . 
an established association exists with human papillomavirus ( hpv ) infection and premalignant intra - epithelial dysplasia . 
phased - array mri is recommended as the preferred imaging modality for regional staging . 
currently , mri represents the modality of choice for primary regional staging of scac , assessment of complications , of therapeutic response following chemo - radiotherapy , and of possible recurrences   .
an uncommon malignancy in the general population , squamocellular anal carcinoma ( scac ) accounts for approximately 1 % of all gastrointestinal neoplasms and less than 5 % of anorectal tumours . in past decades
state - of - the - art cross - sectional imaging with high - resolution mri using external phased - array coils and multiplanar mdct allow detailed , comprehensive visualisation of abnormalities involving the anus and perineal region .
the established association with hpv infection and premalignant intra - epithelial dysplastic changes provides insight into the pathogenesis of hiv- and ibd - related anal cancers , and the possibility of prevention or early diagnosis through screening of high - risk individuals   .
