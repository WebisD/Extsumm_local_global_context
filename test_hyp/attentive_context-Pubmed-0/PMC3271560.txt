we report a case of atg - induced non - cardiogenic pulmonary edema ( ncpe ) , its diagnosis and management under general anesthesia .
, few cases have been reported from which it is believed that in rare cases , atg is responsible for a spectrum of lung injuries varying from transient infiltrate to full - blown acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
thymoglobulin , rabbit anti - human thymocyte immunoglobulin ( atg ) , is an immunosuppressive drug used as an anti - rejection therapy in solid organ transplantation and in hematological diseases .
our purpose of reporting this case is to alert anesthesiologists involved in transplantation program of this acute complication related to atg infusion so that they are prepared to treat it promptly .
an association between atg and acute lung injury was first described in an experimental model in 1975 . since then
a 28-year - old , 50 kg man with asa risk iii was posted for laparoscopic renal transplantation .
ncpe is characterized by simultaneous presence of severe hypoxemia , bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest radiograph and no evidence of left atrial hypertension / congestive heart failure / fluid overload .
