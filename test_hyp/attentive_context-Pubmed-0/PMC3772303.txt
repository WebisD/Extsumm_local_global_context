we describe life salvage of ecmo in a patient with cardiogenic shock and malignant arrhythmia caused by acute fulminant myocarditis .
a 53-year - old korean - chinese woman was brought into the emergency department of our hospital by an ambulance , with complaints of progressive chest pain and dyspnea .
acute myocarditis is associated with various electrocardiogram ( ecg ) alterations , including st - t changes , q - waves , atrioventricular- and intraventricular - conduction delays , atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia , and low voltage .
fulminant myocarditis with ventricular arrhythmia or atrioventricular block is associated with a high mortality rate .
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) is instituted for the management of life threatening pulmonary or cardiac failure , when no other forms of treatment are likely to be successful .
however , early adaptation of mechanical circulatory support , such as iabp and ecmo , combined with intensive medical therapy could save our patient with high - risk fulminant myocarditis .
fulminant myocarditis is an inflammatory process that occurs in the myocardium and has a fatal course due to the rapid development into acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock.1 ) fulminant myocarditis is associated with various ecg alterations , including st - t changes , q - waves , atrioventricular- and intraventricular - conduction delays , atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia , and low voltage.2 ) our case demonstrated various alterations of ecg , which are some of the characteristics that are observed in the fulminant myocarditis . at first , ecg showed st segmental changes associated with myocardial ischemia , then ecg showed various manifestations , such as ventricular tachycardia , atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block , and complete atrioventricular block .
