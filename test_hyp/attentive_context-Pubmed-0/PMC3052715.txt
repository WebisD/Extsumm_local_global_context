therefore , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between diabetes control and comorbidity using a comprehensive comorbidity index in a primary care setting .
our study suggests that comorbidity , measured with an exhaustive index , is not a factor that prevents the achievement of a good glycemia control in patients with type 2 diabetes .
the results of this study suggest that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the presence of comorbidity measured with the cirs , is not related to glycemia control defined by hba1c levels .
, we performed a random selection of patients with type 2 diabetes who had at least two measurements of hba1c levels between january 1st , 2004 and september 1st , 2006 .
given that the proportion of complications is around 50% when diabetes is not controlled , the two group chi - square test at the 0.05 level had a 34% statistical power to detect an odds ratio of 0.5 with sample sizes of 30 ( uncontrolled diabetes ) and 66 ( controlled diabetes ) ( nquery advisor 6.01 ) . despite these limitations ,
