a particular focus was the simplification that he called " beanbag genetics " , in which " evolutionary genetics was essentially presented as an input or output of genes , as the adding of certain beans to a beanbag and the withdrawing of others . " .
in 1959 ernst mayr ( figure 1 ) flung down the gauntlet   at the feet of the three great population geneticists ra fisher , sewall wright and jbs haldane ( figure 2 ) : " but what , precisely , " he said , " has been the contribution of this mathematical school to the evolutionary theory , if i may be permitted to ask such a provocative question ? " his skepticism arose in part from the fact that the mathematical theory at the time had little to say about speciation , mayr 's major interest .
but the larger question remains : what indeed has been the contribution of mathematical theory to evolution ?
mathematics is not central to evolution in the way it has been in theoretical physics .
what are some of the newer developments in evolution that are owed to mathematical theory ? here are a few .
