therefore , we hypothesized that oxidative by - products , such as hydroxyl radicals - damaged human igg , help to initiate autoimmunity in sle . to test this hypothesis , we investigated the binding characteristics of naturally occurring sle autoantibodies to native and hydroxyl radical - modified igg
the induced antibodies against hydroxyl radical - modified igg resembled the diverse antigen - binding characteristics of naturally occurring sle anti - dna autoantibodies .
we also noticed that unmodified igg showed some binding to sle serum antibodies as compared with the antibodies from nhs ( p < 0.05 ) , this may be due to the partial structural similarities of native and modified igg , which may shared common paratope of sle autoantibodies .
the igg modified with the hydroxyl radicals may be one of the factors for the induction of circulating sle autoantibodies .
it is well known that igg is quite vulnerable to ros.2329 many studies showed the presence of elevated levels of oxidized igg in patients with rheumatic diseases.2628 in patients with sle , igg dysfunction has been reported.26 now , it is well documented that igg behaves not only as an antibody , but also as a putative antigen for rheumatoid factor.20,26 therefore , igg is continuously exposed to oxidative stress , as the alterations in its conformation and function could occur , resulting in modification of its biological properties . in the present study , we demonstrated that after modification with ros , human igg became highly immunogenic in experimental animals and the induced antibodies against ros - modified igg showed cross - reactions with native and ros - modified nucleic acid conformers .
