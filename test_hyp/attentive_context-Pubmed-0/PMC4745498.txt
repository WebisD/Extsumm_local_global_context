p. fluorescens was the bacterium with the highest resistance to inactivation , followed by the bacterial consortium .
ha were the interfering substance that resulted in the most severe effect by reducing the activity of qacs , causing , in some circumstances , significant respiratory activity potentiation .
the tested interfering substances , referred in the european standard 1276 ( bsa and ye ) , and known eps constituents related with biofilm resistance ( alg ) resulted in mild interferences on the activity of the qacs .
bessems   demonstrated that a qac tested on three microorganisms ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , staphylococcus aureus , and candida albicans ) had a similar killing rate in the absence of interfering substances and after the inclusion of 17  dh water hardness , a strong reduction of the killing activity was found for the gram - negative bacteria
ha ) on the antimicrobial activity of two qacs ( benzalkonium chloride and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ) against bacillus cereus and pseudomonas fluorescens , as they are two major contaminants in the food industry , particularly the dairy industry , and are a known cause of produce spoilage and foodborne illnesses   .
assessed the effect of dried yeast and human serum on the activity of benzalkonium chloride and concluded that the bactericidal activity of the qac was inhibited by solutions of both interfering substances .
