we describe our combined technique of laparoscopic and gastroscopic transgastric cystogastrostomy for pseudopancreatic cysts in children .
laparoscopic gastroscopic transgastric cystogastrostomy is a safe technique for the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts in children .
the open method requires a large incision with its associated morbidity , and the laparoscopic techniques described so far are technically challenging in the pediatric population .
the endoscopic approach has poor results as the cystenteric opening is small and tends to occlude leading to recurrence and infection .
she had high amylase and lipase levels and a computed tomographic ( ct ) scan showed necrotizing pancreatitis .
subsequently , an abdominal ct scan revealed a well - formed wall enhancing pseudopancreatic cyst ( fig .
a laparoscopic needle was introduced through the laparoscopy port into the cyst to confirm the position of the cyst ( fig .
endoscopic therapy alone involves identifying the region of the cyst bulge with the endoscope , needle localization of the tract , and stent placement for internal drainage .
melman et al compared the three techniques for drainage of pancreatic pseudoscyts in adults and found lower primary success rates for endoscopic drainage as compared with laparoscopic and open cystgastrostomies as well as the need for repeat procedures.5 
  the approach of combined laparoscopic and endoscopic / gastroscopic pseudocyst gastrostomy using intraperitoneal and as well as intragastric visualization has been described in the adult literature but has not been previously reported in children.4 
 7 the use of the laparoscopy during cystgastrostomy allows for pseudocyst debridement , fashioning a large communication between the cyst and stomach , as well as minimizes the risk of complications such as gastric perforation .
