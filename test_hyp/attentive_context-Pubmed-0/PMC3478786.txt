recent evidence reveals that the plg system is crucial for cytokine- or chemotherapy - induced stem cell mobilization . here , we will discuss the role of the plg system in regulating stem cell mobilization .
recruitment of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells ( hpscs ) to the blood followed by chemotherapy or cytokine treatment is a clinical process termed stem cell mobilization .
the studies on plg have revealed an essential role of the plg system in cytokine - induced stem cell mobilization and have elucidated the molecular mechanisms regulating plg - mediated stem cell mobilization .
this has led to studies to identify the mechanisms underlying cytokine - induced stem cell mobilization that could offer better strategies to enhance stem cell mobilization .
stem cell therapy , including direct transplantation of stem cells , stimulation of stem cell mobilization and homing by cytokines , for example g - csf , has emerged as a promising approach to promote tissue repair and regeneration after ischemia .
more importantly , the proposed experimental therapy with plm ( a truncated form of plasmin with fewer side - effects ) or chemotactic peptide ( upar8495 ) to promote hpsc recruitment to the damaged cardiac tissue , will confer clinical therapeutic potentials of plasmin in stem cell - mediated treatment , especially given the verified safety and efficiency of plasmin therapy ( e.g. , tpa ) in mi treatment .
