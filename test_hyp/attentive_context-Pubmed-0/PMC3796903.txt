we present a case of ttp developed after a htr in the setting of cardiac bypass surgery .
abo incompatible blood transfusions are rare , result in haemolytic transfusion reactions ( htr ) , and they can be fatal in 2 to 6% of cases . it is enough to transfuse only 10 - 15 ml of abo incompatible blood to cause following symptoms of acute htr : fever , hypotension , disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) , complement - induced acute intravascular hemolysis and acute renal failure . in adults , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ttp ) is idiopathic in approximately one - third of cases and in the remainder it is encountered in a variety of potentially triggering clinical situations ( so - called secondary ttp ) , including pregnancy , malignancies , drugs , infection , auto - immune disorders and after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation .
a 64-year - old male patient developed nausea , vomiting and chills during red blood cell ( rbc ) suspension transfusion on the second day of coronary by - pass surgery .
secondary thrombotic ttp is a life - threatening condition and is characterized by an aggressive course , it requires prompt treatment at the outset . in case of delayed or inadequate treatment mortality rate may be close to 100% . to date , there is no report in the literature about secondary ttp caused by abo incompatible blood transfusion .
