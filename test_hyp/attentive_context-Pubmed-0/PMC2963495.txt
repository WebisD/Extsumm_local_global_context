the hrs for all - cause mortality were significant for individuals who had an a1c 8% ( hr 1.65 , 95% ci 1.112.45 ) or reported no regular physical activity ( 1.58 , 1.242.02 ) or current tobacco use ( 1.77 , 1.152.73 ) .
8% , 16.4% for no regular physical activity , and 7.5% for current tobacco use . population characteristics and cumulative mortality of individuals with diabetes in nhanes iii proportional hazards analysis results from all - cause mortality : nhanes iii mortality follow - up par% = prevalence among decedents  [ ( hr  1)/hr ] .
we estimate that mortality rates could be decreased by 15.3 , 16.4 , and 7.5% , respectively , if the following risk factors were eliminated : having an a1c of 8% , physical inactivity , or current smoking .
the age - adjusted relative risk for cardiovascular disease was 0.54 ( 95% ci 0.390.76 ) for women who performed 4 h of moderate or vigorous exercise per week ( 14 ) .
in this nationally representative sample of individuals with diabetes , we found three statistically significant risk factors for all - cause mortality .
older individuals and individuals with less education were more likely to have died in the follow - up period .
