accumulation of smooth muscle cells ( smcs ) in the tunica intima plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of vascular lesions , including atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty or stenting procedures ( 1 , 2 ) . in the classical pathogenetic hypothesis of atherosclerosis , following injury growth factors and
smcs within the normal tunica media of the adult vascular wall are heterogeneous , and prevalence of a  synthetic 
the presence of cells expressing stem cell antigens have been identified in the normal arterial wall ( 11 , 12 ) , supporting a potential role of adult vascular wall - resident stem cells ( vrscs ) in vascular pathobiology . in this review ,
starting from smc heterogeneity , a considerable accumulating evidence suggests the presence of a small population of vrscs in different layers of the normal adult arterial wall , and its potential contribute to the homeostasis of post - natal arterial wall but also to pathological remodelling .
the characteristics and the potential contribution of vrscs to the development of great vessel lesions are discussed .
studies in human transplantation arteriopathy and primary atherosclerotic lesions showed that recruited bone marrow or host - derived circulating precursors are present in the lesions ( 68 ) . successively , other studies refused this hypothesis ( 9 , 10 ) , suggesting that smcs in vascular lesions are mainly derived from the host parietal response . in parallel ,
