we report the cases of two children with 
 xanthogranuloma of the sellar region , presenting central diabetes insipidus ( di ) .
currently , whether this condition is a truly distinct entity or merely a different 
 manifestation of adamantinomatous craniopharyingioma is unclear . to clarify the natural 
 history , pathogenesis and prognosis in childhood , further accumulation of well - characterized 
 pediatric cases with xanthogranuloma
we report the cases of two children with xanthogranuloma in the pituitary region with di . 

, there is no detailed clinical report of xanthogranuloma of the 
 sellar region in cases of pediatric age . here ,
a 9-yr - old japanese boy was referred to our clinic because of a 6-mo history of polyuria 
 and polydipsia .
these points 
 may be helpful in considering xanthogranuloma of the pituitary region . however , there is no 
 reliable way to distinguish xanthogranuloma from craniopharyngioma and rathke s cyst without 
 histological examination . in conclusion ,
pituitary insufficiency in childhood is often secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic 
 space - occupying lesions .
by contrast , our patients did 
 not have severe defects of anterior pituitary hormones and showed only central di . in the 
 first report
the differential diagnosis in etiologies of a mass in the sella is 
 broad in spectrum , including rathke s cyst , tumor , autoimmune diseases , primary or 
 metastatic neoplasms , and granulomatous inflammation . among them , xanthomatous pituitary 
 diseases are rare in childhood .
