, the results of the present study demonstrated that aglepristone treatment significantly decreased blood glucose concentration in bitches with progestin - induced insulin - resistance .
prior to aglepristone administration , the mean serum p4 concentrations averaged 9.25  3.15 and 10.50  2.06 ng / ml in group t and group c , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) ( tables 1 and 2 ) , while the mean plasma gh concentrations were 2.37  0.17 g / l in group t and 1.80  0.11 g / l in group c ( p < 0.05 ) . following treatment , the plasma gh concentration in group t was significantly lower 1.7  0.6 g / l ( tables 3 and 4 ) ; however , in group group c it was 1.68  0.07
the mean p4 serum concentrations were 8.37  2.24 and 9.33  1.79 ng / ml in group t and group c , respectively ( tables 5 and 6 ) .
the present study was conducted to investigate the use of aglepristone for the treatment of insulin - resistant diabetes mellitus during the luteal phase .
this results in group t allowed us to keep insulin dosage less than 1 iu / kg during the following 6 weeks , while before the aglepristone treatment the mean insulin dosage was 1.98  0.68 iu / kg ( tables 1 and 5 ) .
