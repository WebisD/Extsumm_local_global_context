the aim of this study was therefore to test the modulus of elasticity ( e ) across the interfaces of veneered dental ytzp ceramics using nanoindentation .
the present study has shown nanoindentation using spherical indentation and the multiple point load - partial unload method to be a reliable predictor of e and a useful evaluation tool for layered dental ceramic interfaces .
the conclusion of this study associates a significantly ( p < .05 ) lower e value with the presence of an interlayer between the ytzp core material and glass - ceramic veneering material in a multi - layered all ceramic dental restorative system .
the value on the interface for both type-1 and 2 specimens shows a significantly lower value ( p
there was a statistical difference between e values of the interface and the veneering materials ( p < .05 ) .
the mean and standard deviation ( sd ) of e values of the last 20 data points ( partial unloadings ) from each indentation site ( 3 indentation sites per distance ) were used to plot graphs of e changes across the interface for both type-1 and 2 specimens ( fig .
the interface value was significantly different ( p < .05 ) when compared to all other values of type-2 specimen .
