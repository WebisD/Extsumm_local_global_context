in a manual operation benchmarking test , it took a person very familiar with all processes about 1260  s and 380 discrete steps to design the primers of hadhsc ( l-3-hydroxyacyl - coenzyme a dehydrogenase , short chain ) , our benchmark gene with 10 exons .
a snp i d or up to 100 batched snp ids , in most cases all the primer sequences should be returned in a minute or two . the generated information , including gene transcript graph , primer data from primer3 , and direct links to ucsc in - silico pcr ( 3,4 ) for pcr product prediction , to ncbi blast and to ensembl source data , is integrated and displayed on a single page for convenient viewing .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is a commonly used laboratory procedure nowadays for a variety of tasks , such as dna cloning , sequence determination and snp detection .
there are a multitude of user - definable options available including product size , maximum exon length , excluded regions of the query sequence , gc - content and maximum allowable local alignment score . simply by submitting a candidate gene name ,
