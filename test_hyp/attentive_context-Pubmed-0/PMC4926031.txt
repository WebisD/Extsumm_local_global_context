unfortunately , there are no controlled study on the prevalence of psychological distress and emotional pain in adult nigerian dental patients to the best of our knowledge following an extensive literature search . therefore , the aim of this study was to compare , with a matched control , the prevalence of psychological distress and emotional pain among patients attending an outpatient dental clinic in nigeria .
a positive score suggestive of emotional pain ( psych ache ) was found in over a third of the dental patients ( 37.6% , n=38 ) , while on the other hand , only 13% of the controls experienced psych ache ( p<0.001 ) .
21.8% ( n=22 ) of the subject had ghq-12 scores of 3 and above ( suggestive of psychological distress ) while only 7% of the control group had ghq suggestive of psychological distress .
the mean score for the test and control group was 0.721.2 and 0.370.6 respectively ( p=0.011 ) . in the test group ,
they presented with jaw pain and were to have oral surgery ( test group ) and were matched with 100 controls ( non - patients ; normal relatives of dental patients ) .
