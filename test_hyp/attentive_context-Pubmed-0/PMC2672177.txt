, our study results showed that at higher hrs , multisector reconstruction in a 64-detector mdct achieved better temporal resolution , fewer nonassessable segments , better image quality , less cardiac motion related banding artifacts and less error in measuring the degree of stenosis .
the number of nonassessable segments was correlated with the reconstruction algorithm ( p = 0.004 ) and hr ( p < 0.001 ) , but not with the luminal diameter , the degree of stenosis and the observer . with excluding the nonassessable segments
we also used the relative error to analyze the accuracy of measuring the degree of stenosis according to the following equation : relative error ( % ) = ( the measured degree of stenosis - the true degree of stenosis)100%/true degree of stenosis so less relative error represented better accuracy . when analyzing the accuracy of stenosis detection , also referred to as the relative error , both the assessable and nonassessable segments should be included .
at an hr of 40 and 50 bpm , the temporal window was 227 ms for both the halfscan and multisector reconstructions , so the fan angle in our study was about 53.5. with an increasing hr ( 60 - 120 bpm ) , the temporal window improved in the multisector reconstruction with the best temporal window being 127 ms , while the temporal window in the halfscan reconstruction remained unchanged at 227 ms ( fig .
