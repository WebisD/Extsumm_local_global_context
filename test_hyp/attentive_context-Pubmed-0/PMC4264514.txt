we encountered a hcc patient who underwent deb - tace and experienced delayed intratumoral hemorrhage .
three types of calibrated microspheres have recently been approved in japan as embolic agents for hypervascular tumors and arteriovenous malformations . to date , two types of embolic microspheres capable of being loaded with drug have been introduced : dc bead ( biocompatibles , farnham , uk ) and hepasphere ( biosphere medical , roissy cdg cedex , france ) . in a phase
ii randomized controlled study of transarterial chemoembolization ( tace ) using a drug - eluting bead ( deb - tace ) for hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , the precision - v study , the response rate after 6 months was 52% in the deb - tace group and 44% in the tace group using a lipiodol ( laboratoire guerbet , aulnay - sous - bois , france)/anticancer drug mixture solution ( lip - tace ) , showing no significant difference or superiority of deb - tace .
we encountered a patient who experienced intratumoral hemorrhage about 1 month after deb - tace .
deb - tace for hcc is a new treatment method in japan , and reports of adverse events may increase in the future . to obtain the therapeutic effect of deb - tace while preventing the adverse events , it may be important to understand the characteristics of the beads themselves and to apply the appropriate embolization to each individual case .
