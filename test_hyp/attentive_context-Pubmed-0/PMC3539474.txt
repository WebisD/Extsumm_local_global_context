this study indicates that not only a small capsulorhexis diameter , but also its central localization and its regular shape result in less posterior capsular opacification following the phacoemulsification procedure .
the amount of pco in the groups with central ( 66 patients ) and paracentral ( 33 patients ) capsulorhexis localization was similar ( figure 3 ) 
the first subgroup of 59 patients ( 58% ) were found to have regularly shaped capsulorhexis rims and 42 patients ( 42% ) were found to have irregularly shaped rims . at the 6-month follow - up , in the group in which the capsulorhexis diameter was observed , the edge of the large capsulorhexis lay at the edge of the intraocular lens optic in 19% ( 8 patients ) , while the rest of the patients had the edge of the anterior capsulorhexis on the intraocular lens optic for 360 degrees when the capsulorhexis was small as well as in large ones .
there was no statistically significant difference in the kruskal - wallis test results between the groups with small , central and regular shape of capsulorhexis ( p=0.6997 ) ( table 4 ) . in the group of all operated patients , 38 ( 12% ) of those experiencing severe postoperative posterior capsule opacification qualified for a neodymium : yttrium - aluminium - garnet ( nd : yag ) laser posterior capsulotomy .
