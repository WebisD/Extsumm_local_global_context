the 3 important biological / clinical conditions are : the ssc - specific serum autoantibodies , the ssc skin digital ulcers ( dus ) , and the pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) associated to ssc .
systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) is characterized by early and persistent microvascular impairment leading to functional raynaud 's phenomenon ( rp ) and clinical manifestations ( i.e. , digital ulcers , pulmonary arterial hypertension , etc . ) ( figure 1 )   .   digital ulcers in ssc are considered to be related to tissue ischemia following several processes , including at the beginning persistent vasospasm ( rp ) , but in the progression of the disease also to intimal fibroproliferation , tissue fibrosis , and thrombosis of digital arteries .  
recently , a first step in assessing reliability has been taken through demonstration of reliability both in qualitative and semiquantitative assessment of nailfold images of ssc patients in a bicentre setting .
the assessment of vascular involvement is still a matter of study , and several noninvasive techniques have been proposed .
progressive deficiency in vasodilatory capacity of the vessels and tissue fibrosis is proposed as a mechanism of the persistent vascular spasm ; however , the mechanism of endothelial injury is still unclear .
