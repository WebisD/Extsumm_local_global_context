this strain is epidemic and most likely causes more acute infections with exacerbated immune responses than other known genotypes of c. burnetii .
this genotype is related to genotypes that harbor the qph1 plasmid , which causes the most severe clinical forms of acute q fever in experimental animal models ( 11,12 ) .
only bacteria from this group and bacteria containing the qpdv plasmid have been found in cases of human acute q fever ( 9,13 ) .
in 2012 , we received a cardiac valve sample from a patient in cayenne with q fever endocarditis who had undergone surgery in martinique . in the same year , we collected 4 heparinized blood samples from patients with acute q fever from cayenne that were collected before initiation of antimicrobial drug treatment .
this genotype had been identified in our laboratory only once , in 2000 in an aortic valve of a 40-year - old french man who had undergone surgery in france , had q fever endocarditis , and was co - infected with streptococcus oralis .
we believe that severity of q fever infection is related to the strain of c. burnetii circulating in cayenne . because the population in french guiana is a large diversity of creole , amerindian , maroon , caucasian , and asian persons ( 14 ) , we excluded the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility of patients from cayenne to c. burnetii infection might be related to severity of the disease .
