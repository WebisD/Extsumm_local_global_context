, 3.1% and 2.9% of the genes represented on the affymetrix chip ) , thereby permitting us to compare gene expression profiles in highly enriched normal and leukemic quiescent progenitors and stem cells .
if for any reason a patient has to stop therapy , these cells have sufficient self - renewal ability to recreate the disease by reconstituting the stem cell population and also enhancing the probability that the leukemic cells will develop resistance to the drugs , leaving bone marrow transplantation as the only option for survival . in order to search for critical differences in biochemical pathways and regulatory networks between cml and normal quiescent progenitors and stem cells that might ultimately serve as selective targets , we decided to compare the gene expression profiles of the normal and cml quiescent cell fractions .
however in advanced malignancies it is often difficult to distinguish the importance of the primary causative mutation(s ) compared to that of secondary or still later ( passenger ) mutations and the situation may become further complicated by multiple epigenetic changes .   a huge number of new drugs of different classes are now available , but few cause complete or durable remissions and they are almost never curative .   greater emphasis should therefore be placed on more clearly identifying and whenever possible selectively targeting the primary driving mutations in the cancer stem or early progenitor cells in early stage disease , and also in developing new strategies to selectively kill the quiescent stem or progenitor cells that escape most current therapies .
