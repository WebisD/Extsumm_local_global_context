to explain the mechanism of metal action on the plasma membrane proton pump , the hydrolytic and transporting activities of h - atpase were measured simultaneously with the expression of genes encoding the enzyme .
moreover , the effect of cantharidin , a specific inhibitor of phosphatases , on the inhibitory action of metals on the h - atpase was determined .
we think that some changes in plant cells initiated under heavy metals lead to an increase in the activity of specific phosphatases , responsible for the dephosphorylation of h - atpase protein . taken together
, the data presented suggest that alterations of the plasma membrane proton pump under heavy metal stresses are mainly due to the post - translational modification of its protein . only in the case of cadmium action ,
finally , the accumulation of cadmium , copper , and nickel in cucumber roots was asseyed to estimate to what degree the efficiency of metal absorption may affect the h - atpase activity .
since one of the main function of plasma membrane h - atpase is the regulation of growth ( rayle and cleland , 1992 ) , it could be suggested that the enhanced growth of plants subjected to low concentrations of ni and the lowered growth in the presence of higher concentrations of ni is , at least partially , a result of the modification of plasma membrane h - atpase activity by nickel .
