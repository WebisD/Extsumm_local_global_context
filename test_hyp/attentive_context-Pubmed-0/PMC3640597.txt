arterial gas analyses resulting in initiation of niv was registered in 51.4% of cases ; in these patients , the median ph was 7.24 ( 7.077.43 ) , and median pco2 ( kpa ) was 10.1 ( 6.0 , 20.3 ) .
the aim of this study was to analyze long - term all - cause mortality following the first years of implementing niv in a real - life acute medical ward at a university hospital in denmark , with the null hypothesis that niv has no impact on long - term survival .
randomized controlled studies have shown that noninvasive ventilation ( niv ) reduces short - term mortality , risk of intubation and complication rate when given as an additional treatment to selected patients with an acute exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) complicated by hypercapnic acute respiratory failure.1,2 plant et al2 showed a decrease of the in - hospital mortality rate from 20% to 10% when niv was given to patients with mild acidosis and in a stationary or intermediary ward in a multicenter setting .
monitoring of patient outcomes in a real - life setting is necessary to ensure optimal selection of patients for niv in a non - icu setting .
