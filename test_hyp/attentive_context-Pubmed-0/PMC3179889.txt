the use of autogenous periosteum in general medical treatment has been extensive and has shown promising results   ; on the contrary in dentistry , the use of periosteum as a regenerative tool has been limited and highly underrated ; therefore , the purpose of this paper is to highlight the current status of use of periosteum in dentistry as well as suggesting its future use in various treatment options related specifically to dental field .
a lot of research has been done in the past , and still research is going on to explore tools and techniques for regeneration of lost tissues as a result of the disease process .
the use of various grafts and recent tissue engineering techniques including stem cell research are testimony to the ever increasing need for most suitable treatment option to replace / repair lost tissues due to various pathologic processes .
the use of periosteum can revolutionize the success of various dental treatments which require either bone or soft tissue regeneration ; particularly the future use of periosteum must be explored in periodontal and implant surgical procedures . although the regenerative potential of periosteum has been proved by numerous studies , till date the use of periosteum - derived grafts has still not become a standard tool in the armamentarium of dental surgeons , and it may still need some time , and further research before the full regenerative potential of periosteum is utilized .
