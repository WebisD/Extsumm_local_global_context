the frequent co - morbidities in this patient population necessitate careful pre - operative planning and a multidisciplinary approach for optimal outcomes .
a hierarchy of available options for soft tissue reconstruction in the diabetic foot is applied based on the size and location of the defect in conjunction with the vascularity of the limb .
pre - operative planning for these flaps involves meticulous evaluation of the vascular supply and its anatomic variations .
generally , plastic reconstruction involves free skin grafts ( 3 ) or flaps . soft tissue defects that are present in the diabetic foot often need flap reconstruction .
free tissue transfers with vascular anastomosis may be performed with skepticism and after a thorough evaluation of the vascular status of the diabetic limb with angiography .
it is our opinion that skin grafts are not usually recommended for a majority of the extremely deep and severe wounds encountered forms b , c , d ; grades ii , iii ( table 1 ) ; and especially when they are located at the weight - bearing aspect of the foot and without enough subdermic soft tissue ( fat or muscle ) between the skin graft and the underlying bone . dorsal and some plantar soft tissue defects and non - weight - bearing donor site defects are usually the only diabetic foot wounds we elect to cover with a skin graft
