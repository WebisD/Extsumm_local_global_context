this case report attempts to utilize a bioactive glass with the property of osteostimulation as bone replacement graft in the treatment of a combined endo - perio lesion with furcation involvement .
therefore within the limits of this study it can be concluded that bioactive glass is effective as a bone graft substitute in treatment of periodontal component of the endodontic lesion .
the relationship between pulp of the tooth and surrounding periodontium was first described in 1964 , and since then the term endo - perio has become an integral part of the dental vocabulary . unfortunately , this term has been used indiscriminately to categorize disease of either periodontal or endodontic etiology , with or without secondary involvement of the other .
bone grafts having a property of osteogenesis , osteoinduction , and osteoconduction have been used in the past .
although the role of pulpal pathology in the etiology of furcation involvement is still unclear , the high incidence of molar teeth with accessory canals supports such an association .
the periodontium and pulp have embryonic , anatomic , and functional interrelationship . the relationship between pulpal and periodontal disease
can be traced to embryological development , since the pulp and the periodontium are derived from a common mesodermal source . at the stage of tooth development
