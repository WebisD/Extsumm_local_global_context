the purpose of this study was to discern if physiological and qol - related benefits of yoga exist in individuals with pd .
because overall function measured by the unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) was investigated , we wanted to discern whether yoga affects the non - motor aspects of pd .
the purpose of this study was to determine the potential effects of yoga on non - motor symptoms , specifically depression , qol and physiological measures .
health - related qol measures included the modified falls efficacy scale ( fes ) , the geriatric depression scale ( gds ) and the sf-36 . physiological measures included weight , resting heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure and standard pulmonary function tests calculated by a puritan - bennett renaissance ii spirometer ( covidien - puritan bennett , boulder , co , usa ) .
it is important to determine conservative intervention to treat physiological functions and clinical outcomes contributing to qol in pd for which yoga appears to be a viable intervention .
this pilot study presents additional findings . medical information and self - reported symptoms included time of pd diagnosis , current medications , pd - related symptoms , physical and social activity levels , and fall incidents .
