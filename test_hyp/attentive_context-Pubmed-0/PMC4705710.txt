we found a higher cct , iop , and tear igf-1 values in the active phase of the disease .
in acromegaly , normalization of igf - i in serum has been used to follow - up the success of surgical and medical therapies .
the activity of the disease may have an impact on ocular parameters such as cct , iop , and tear igf-1 values .
this study inspired us to hypothesize that the eyes might be another target organ for the effects of excess gh and igf-1 , hence in our study we measured tear igf-1 levels and evaluated the relationship with cct and iop before and after treatment in two acromegaly patients .
a newly diagnosed acromegaly patient aged 45-year - old woman was referred to our clinic for an ophthalmologic examination from the endocrinology department of our hospital .
van setten et al . reported that the igf-1 level was elevated not only in the serum , but also in the subretinal fluid and aqueous humor in a patient with acromegaly .
bramsen et al . divided 27 pituitary adenoma patients into two groups as those with and without acromegaly and reported higher cct values in the group with acromegaly .
