similarly , we expect that the neural representations of auditory cortical neurons in the older rats will show more plastic training - induced changes and that these same neurons will display young - adult functional properties to a greater extent following training ( see ) .
, we used the rat primary auditory cortex ( a1 ) as it has repeatedly proven to be an excellent model to study brain plasticity where perceptual learning is often reflected in the training - specific refinement of auditory cortical representations in both young and aging brains   .
furthermore , we also wanted to document how cholinergic enhancement differentially affects the expression of auditory cortical plasticity mechanisms associated with perceptual learning in both young and older adults .
the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a cholinesterase inhibitor ( rivastigmine tartrate ) on both brain function and behavior and how these effects might differ in young and old rats given the important cholinergic deficit observed in older rats ( see figure 1 ) . while it is clearly established that cholinergic enhancement boosts perceptual learning in young adults , little is known about whether boosting a deficient cholinergic system in the elderly would help reduce the gap that exists between young and aged adults in terms of their perceptual learning rates .
