the masticatory activity , thermal cycling , oral microbiota , variations in the salivary flow and food impaction , which may occur if the root canal is left unsealed , constitute situations in the oral environment that are hardly reproduced in the laboratory . in an attempt to complement the existing literature and minimize the limitations of in vitro investigations , the present study comprised an in vivo evaluation of the sealing ability of a resin - based sealer ( ah plus ) and a zinc oxide - eugenol sealer ( endofill ) in dogs ' teeth exposed to the oral environment for either 45 or 90 days , testing the hypothesis that the resin - based sealer result in lower leakage than the zinc oxide - eugenol sealer after 90 days .
the endodontic sealer , endofill , after 90 days of exposure to the oral environment , presented lower sealing ability compared to the 45-day period and with ah plus at both periods .
based on the research protocol and results of the present study , it can be stated that : after 45 days of exposure to the oral environment , the endodontic sealers tested were not able to keep the root canal impermeable and prevent coronal dye leakage .
