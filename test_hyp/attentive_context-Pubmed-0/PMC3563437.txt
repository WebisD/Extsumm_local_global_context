efforts to improve the outcomes of surgical coronary revascularization have taken many forms , but among the most successful have been bilateral internal mammary artery ( i m a ) and radial artery ( ra ) grafts .
this article will review the current status of  all - arterial  coronary bypass in current clinical practice .
recent refinements in ra preparation and management   have taken ra patencies close to i m a s , now providing surgeons with up to four excellent arterial conduits . with four arteries and liberal sequential grafting methods , most patients can benefit from all - arterial grafts .
it has been clear for some time that saphenous vein conduits have limited life span , and that multiple i m a s improve graft patency and clinical results .
, surgery and pci are becoming complementary rather than competitive , and in coming years , all - arterial coronary bypass should play an increasingly important role in the treatment of coronary artery disease .
while a right i m a to left anterior descending ( lad ) coronary bypass was among the first coronary revascularizations performed and reported in 1967 , the subject was controversial until loop and associates demonstrated clear clinical benefits in the early 1980 s .
