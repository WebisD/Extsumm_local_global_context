among patients with haemophilia ( and their physicians ) , there is often a reluctance to switch factor concentrates because of concerns about increasing the risk of inhibitors .
however , current evidence does not suggest that switching products significantly influences inhibitor development . with the forthcoming arrival of new haemophilia treatments ,
data were provided regarding haemophilia a ( n  =  37 ) and b ( n  =  9 ) , of which the majority of patients had severe haemophilia ( n  =  27 ) , and some patients had been diagnosed with an inhibitor ( n  =  9 ) . of note , 57% of the respondents believed that the probability of inhibitor development was high or very high when switching product .
lastly , intensive treatment ( including surgery ) is reported to be associated with an increased risk of inhibitor development 7 .
haemophilia patients with a history of inhibitors , including those in whom the inhibitor has been eradicated with immune tolerance induction ( iti ) , may relapse and constitute a group of individuals at higher risk of inhibitor development .
in addition , some patients with haemophilia often develop a strong psychological link with their current product 2 . to investigate patient concerns regarding switching ,
