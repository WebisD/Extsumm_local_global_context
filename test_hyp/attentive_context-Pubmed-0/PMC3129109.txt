we concluded that physical training before pregnancy induces a greater stability of plasma triglycerides and glucose , regardless of daily swimming sessions at different water temperatures .
the sample consisted of sixty - three female wistar rats ( 190  1 g ) , kept in individual cages , receiving water and food ( ad libitum ) ( purina - brazil ) , in an artificially illuminated ambience , with a 12 hour day - night cycle and mean temperature of 24c .
the literature demonstrates that pregnant rats have lower glucose levels than non - pregnant ones submitted to the same exercise conditions , which means they are not influenced by water temperature.8 our findings indicate that , under thermal stress ( 28c or 39c ) , sedentary and exercised pregnant rats present higher plasma glucose values than at 35c .
our results demonstrated that an exercise program before and during the pregnancy produced better results than an exercise program only during pregnancy .
it suggests that the duration of immersion or swimming was more important than the temperature concerning the determination of plasma glucose levels , since in the previous study , which used more extreme temperatures with a shorter duration of exposition , pregnant rats showed steady levels of glucose.8 by determining the glucose level during exercise performed by pregnant women , greater hypoglycemia was recorded compared to that observed in resting condition , but this hypoglycemia is smaller during water exercises than land exercises.22324 glucose returned to resting level within 24 hours of the last session of exercise , indicating the efficiency of the glucose level adjustments.25 this quick regulation is made mainly by the hyperglycemiant hormones action ( catecholamine , cortisol and glucagon ) that have their serum concentrations increased by exercise.1622 in the present study , trained rats had lower values of plasma triglycerides at 35c than sedentary rats , indicating an increase of lipid utilization in this condition .
