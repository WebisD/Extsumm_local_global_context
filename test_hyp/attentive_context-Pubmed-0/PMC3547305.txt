this study shows that coi gene can be used as a useful tool along other dna markers like 28-d3 gene for dissolving closely related taxa of an .
the aim of this study was to evaluate cytochrome oxidase i ( coi ) gene alongside 28s - d3 as a diagnostic tool for identification of an .
fluviatilis mosquitoes ( by its2 and 28s - d3 genes ) from india , iran , and other geographical areas by this genetic marker can bring more insight into taxonomy of this sibling species .
six individuals belonging to two clades ( 87 , 97 , 655 , and 928 ) and ( 92 ) from fars province showed 100% identity .
in addition , ten individuals from other geographical areas including four from koveh ( 170 , 172 , 173 , and 186 ) and one from minab ( 121 ) in hormozgan province , two from abchekan ( 392393 ) in sistan va baluchestan province , and three from kahnouj in kerman province ( 815 , 836 , and 839 ) were 100% identical .
