in conclusion , although spinal decompression with fusion and posterior instrumentation in surgical treatment of the patients with lds result in satisfactory outcome , vertebral reduction can not significantly enhance the clinical improvement .
pre- and postoperative radiological and clinical characteristics of our patients odi : oswestry disability index , vas : visual analogue scale , comparison based on paired t - test pearson correlation between the amount of vertebral reduction and odi improvement was not statistically significant ( r=0.15 , p=0.322 ) . although regarding to positive 
the mean slip correction rate was 52.211.6% ( ranged 21 - 95% ) with a mean loss of correction of 4.81.1% ( ranged 0 - 11% ) .
these include indirect reduction alone , decompression alone , decompression plus lumbar fusion with or without instrumentation , decompression and slip reduction plus instrumented fusion . in this study , we aimed to evaluate the surgical outcome of degenerative spondylolisthesis with neural decompression , pedicular screw fixation , and posterolateral fusion .
slip reduction of more than 5% was obtained in 39 cases ( 86.7% ) , ranged 0 to 31% .
the mean age of the patients at surgery and the mean follow - up period were 58.33.5 years ( ranged 43 - 76 ) and 31.24.8 months ( ranged 24 - 52 ) , respectively .
