completion of a pregnancy invokes two potentially opposing effects on the mother s subsequent risk of breast cancer , hence the dual effect of pregnancy .
mechanisms underlying the distinct biology of pregnancy - associated tumors that are promoted by involution are currently being identified in human and rodent mammary tissues in our labs .
most familiar in breast cancer risk tables is the association of parity with a lifetime reduction in breast cancer risk .
however , the risks related to pregnancy history are not currently incorporated into clinical tools for assessing a woman s risk for the development of breast cancer .
greater understanding of this transient increase is needed for subsequent adaptation into clinical breast cancer risk assessment . moreover , attention to this breast cancer risk factor is warranted in the assessment of young women presenting with breast complaints in the post - partum years and consideration of such risk along with the clinical guidelines for evaluation of such complaints is required to avoid false reassurance or delayed diagnosis .
emerging epidemiologic and prospective research is providing enhanced insight into this subset of young women s breast cancer , allowing it to progress as an important focus for goals of prevention , therapeutics , and survivorship interventions in the future .
