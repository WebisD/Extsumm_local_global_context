a summary of the results ( table 2 ) found that arctic char , red snapper and fresh water trout contained the lowest concentrations of hg , averaging 37 , 148 and 55 ng g , respectively .
average levels in the other fish types varied from 384 ng g for black cod to 854 ng g for marlin .
note : designated fish subject to a 1000 ngg regulatory limit , others to a limit of 500 ngg average concentrations of hg in the different species were in general agreement with those found in other canadian and international surveys ( table 3 ) .
marlin , sea bass , red snapper , orange roughy , fresh water trout , grouper , black cod ( sablefish ) , arctic char , king fish ( king mackerel ) and tilefish are included in this survey .
for example , tilefish caught in the atlantic ocean contained 144 ng g hg , whereas those sampled in the gulf of mexico averaged 1450 ng g ( fda 2009 ) .
this survey is a supplement to the previous work and provides levels of hg found in retail fish purchased in 2005 .
144 ng g in atlantic tilefish and 1450 ng g in those caught in the gulf of mexico ( fda 2009 ) .
