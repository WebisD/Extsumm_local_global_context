this paper presents results of a five - year study on the solid culture of the callus obtained from the iranian a. euchroma root and antimicrobial properties of its pigment .
it is evident from the results , illustrated in figure 4(e ) , that the extract of iranian a. euchroma has almost completely inhibited the m. luteus growth , while the s. aureus growth has remained unchanged . considering these results and the previous scientific reports , it can be concluded that the a. euchroma root extract has a greater inhibiting potential toward gram - positive bacteria .
callus induction was examined on two groups of explants at two different ages ( 10 and 20 days old ) excised from the young plantlets ( figure 2(b ) ) .
the a. euchroma extract was applied in the liquid culture of s. aureus , m. luteus , e. coli , and salmonella .
the growth rate of a. euchroma calli on normal ls and mls was studied in the presence and absence of the vitamins ( thiamine and inositol ) during 4 subcultures in three months .
so , the pigment production of a. euchroma callus was studied on a modified m9 ( mm9 ) in which the concentrations of sodium sulfate and potassium sulfate were adjusted at 740 and 907
