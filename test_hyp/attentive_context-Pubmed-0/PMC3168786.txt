thanks to the availability of the s. oneidensis genome sequence , stress responses of the microorganism have been extensively investigated , generating a handful of insights into mechanisms adopted to cope with detrimental conditions
the availability of the genome sequence allowed development of high - throughput technologies such as microarrays and proteomics tools , with which an array of assays has been carried out to decipher the ability of s. oneidensis to respond to and survive external stresses . while impacts of most of common environmental factors have been examined , oxidative stress imposed by h2o2 is surprisingly untouched . in this paper , we consider all insights into the stress response mechanisms revealed thus far in s. oneidensis and broaden our discussion to other sequenced species if necessary .
extensive physiological and genetic analyses of the stress response systems in these two bacteria have helped us to elucidate the complexity of the process , function of critical proteins , and regulation . while model organisms will continue to provide insights into the fundamental properties of the stress response systems ,
in addition , shewanellae have now served as the model for ecological and evolutionary studies at the whole genome level because of its diverse habitats and the availability of up to 26 genome sequences   .
