how the two different vaccines against group c meningococci ( polysaccharide and conjugate ) influence the selection of serogroup b belonging to the a4 lineage strains in spain that have had a capsular - switching event would be an interesting future topic of research .
the spanish reference laboratory for meningococci routinely receives meningococci isolated from sterile sites for serogrouping , serotyping , and serosubtyping . from january 1995 to november 2000 ( just before the new c conjugate vaccine was routinely introduced ) , the laboratory received 2,975 meningococcal strains to be characterized by serotyping and serosubtyping with monoclonal antibodies ( 8) .
this possibility was not confirmed in our study but should be more accurately analyzed in the future . in 2000 , a new increase in cases of group c meningococcal disease was detected in some regions of spain ( 6 ) . because of these data , spanish health authorities made the decision to include a new group c conjugate vaccine in the routine infant immunization schedule beginning in autumn 2000 .
fifteen ( 83.3% ) meningococci showed sequence types identified as representative of the a4 clonal lineage ; this lineage also represents the genotype of the c:2b : p1.2,5 epidemic strain .
