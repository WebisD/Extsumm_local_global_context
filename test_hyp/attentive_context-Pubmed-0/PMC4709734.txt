the study established the current status of the acceptance and utilisation of rbm programme tools ( itns and sp in pregnancy ) among pregnant women who accessed two models of healthcare facilities in oyo state from 2001 to 2009 , an initiative implemented with the purpose of stemming of malaria - related morbidity and mortality among these pregnant women and their unborn children . though the acceptance and utilisation of rbm tools were higher among pregnant women who accessed government phc clinics and in rural areas than among pregnant women who accessed faith clinics and in urban areas , these were far from meeting the set targets .
pregnant women 's marital status and husbands ' occupations significantly and statistically influenced acceptance while husbands ' occupations influenced the utilisation of rbm tools implying that spouses ' statuses play significant roles in achieving set targets .
