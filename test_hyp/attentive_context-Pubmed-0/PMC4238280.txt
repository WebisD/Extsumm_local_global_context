age - adjusted incidence rates for caucasians , african - americans , american indians , and asian pacific islanders were 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.3 , and 0.1 cases / million , respectively ( data not shown ) , with a statistically significant difference between caucasians and african - americans ( p = 0.037 ) ( figure 1(c ) ) .
compared to caucasian cases , death was 30% more likely among african - american cases ( hr : 1.30 ; 95% ci : 0.86 , 1.95 ) ( figure 2(a ) ) . after adjusting age at diagnosis , radiation therapy at any time
was not associated with improved survival ( hradj = 0.73 ; 95% ci 0.49 , 1.11 ) ( figure 2(b ) ) .
age - adjusted incidence rates for males and females were 0.4 and 0.1 cases / million , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1(b ) ) .
the statistically significant association remained after adjusting for age at diagnosis ( hradj 0.53 ; 95% ci 0.32 , 0.87 ) .
the age - adjusted incidence rate of dsrct was 0.3 cases / million , with a peak incidence of 0.74 cases / million in persons 2024 years of age ( figure 1(a ) ) . in blacks ,
