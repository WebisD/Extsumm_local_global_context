however , here we report a rare case of a small esophageal gist in a patient with dyspnea who presented with a mediastinal mass on chest x - ray and was initially diagnosed by a pathologist as having leiomyosarcoma and referred for chemotherapy .
they are generally small and asymptomatic , but occasionally can be large and produce dysphagia . a review of the literature revealed a case of a large esophageal gist presenting with dyspnea .
gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gists ) are the most common mesenchymal , nonepithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract in adults between 40 and 50 years of age   . as per seer analysis ,
the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy with fine - needle aspiration of the mass .
our case report highlights the consideration of gists in the differential diagnosis of posterior mediastinal masses and emphasis on the necessity of cd117 staining in those situations which can alter the therapeutic and prognostic implication for the patient .
only 1% of 1,458 gist cases are esophageal in origin , with an incidence of 5170% in the stomach ; 2536% in the small intestine ; 57% in the colon , rectum and appendix , and 13% in the esophagus   .
