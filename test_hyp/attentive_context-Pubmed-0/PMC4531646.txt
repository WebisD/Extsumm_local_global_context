we report a case of serious neurotoxicity following 5-fu infusion for malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) and also briefly review 5-fu related neurotoxicity .
neurotoxicites of 5-fu with manifestations of somnolence , upper motor neuronal signs , cerebellar ataxia and a cluster of symptoms and signs of organic brain syndrome have rarely been reported .
5-fluoruracil ( 5-fu ) , pyrimidine antimetabolite , is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used for various tumors .
the acute form consists of cerebellar syndrome and encephalopathy , whereas the delayed variety takes the form of subacute multifocal ieukoencephalopathy .
however , their efficiency has not been proven . to understand the mechanism of neurological manifestation of 5-fu ,
we reported a case of delayed form of 5-fu neurotoxicity characterized by subacute multifocal leukoencephalopathy .
although both acute and delayed forms have been reported , fluorouracil - induced neurotoxicity is rare .
a 44-year - old male patient received his first cycle of palliative 5-day chemotherapy containing 5-fu ( 800 mg / m ) , adriamycin ( 40 mg / m ) and mitomycin- c ( 8 mg / m ) for a recurrent , massive , malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) which developed at 3 years after surgery .
