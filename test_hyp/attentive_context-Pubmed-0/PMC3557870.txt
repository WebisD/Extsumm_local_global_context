the emergence of mrsa harboring the novel meca homologue has consequences for the verification methods for mrsa used in veterinary medicine ; implementation of new methods will be inevitable .
their supposed restriction to only a few genetic lineages and the potential risk for interspecies transmission of atypical mrsa between companion animals and their owners in household environments needs further elucidation .
our findings of cc130 and st599 mrsa harboring mecalga251 in several companion animal species suggest that in germany , the presence of the meca homologue in mrsa is not exclusively associated with cc130 .
this finding supports the hypothesis that some , if not all , mrsa strains that harbor the novel meca variant can cause infections among a broad variety of hosts , as has been shown for mrsa of human , equine , canine , and other companion animal origins ( 1,7 ) .
in addition , cc130 mrsa containing the meca homologue has only recently been reported for isolates from humans in germany ( 5 ) . although many investigators focus on livestock - associated mrsa , and because particular companion animal lineages of mrsa seem to be lacking , transmission of mrsa between companion animals and human family members in close proximity might be underestimated , especially in cases of recurrent infection ( 15 ) .
