previous studies of traditional approaches to cognitive remediation in schizophrenia have been confounded by various methodological issues ( see refs 11,12 ) : small subject samples ,  open - label  conditions ,
this indicates that appropriate cognitive training can prepare the individual with schizophrenia to benefit from ecologically meaningful learning events , and underscores the fact that optimal treatment in schizophrenia will necessitate multimodal approaches .
can targeted cognitive training be used to remit preexisting cognitive deficits and to promote recovery of function in young individuals who are in the very earliest phases of schizophrenia ? if the promising initial findings we describe here are replicated , we will enter an exciting time for the field of schiz - ophrenia treatment , one which will require active collaborations between basic and clinical neuroscientists with expertise in neuroplasticity ; researchers who perform clinical trials as well as experts in psychosocial remediation ; clinical and research psychopharmacologists , and designers of computer games .
how can we maximize the synergistic benefits of combining cognitive training with psychosocial rehabilitation treatments ?
over the past decade , clinical neuroscience research has unequivocally demonstrated that declarative memory ( those processes involved in recollection of facts and events ) is impaired in schizophrenia ; thus , in keeping with the meta - analysis findings discussed above , it seems clear that strategy coaching and other direct instruction methods are likely to be of only limited benefit for patients .
