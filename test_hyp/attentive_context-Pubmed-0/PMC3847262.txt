, we report a case of reversible cerebellar atrophy induced by pht in a 10-year - old boy .
there is some evidence of the association of long - term use of pht and toxicity like cerebellar atrophy .
after initiating therapy with pht 10 years back , he was seizure free for 2 years .
such cerebellar changes have been reported even with the long - term use of nontoxic levels of phenytoin .
our patient presented with severe cerebellar disorder and he was on the drug for 10 years .
there are a few reports on cerebellar atrophy after long - term use of pth .
however , a sizeable proportion of patients may develop drug induced adverse effects that include sedation , gum hypertrophy , lymphadenopathy , chorea , ataxia , etc .
phenytoin sodium ( pht ) is one of the commonest antiepileptic drug ( aed ) used in children in india .
mri scan of the brain was advised and it showed cerebellar atrophy as shown in figure 1 .
since most of these effects are reversible , it is important to identify the clinical manifestations related to drug toxicity and to manage them appropriately . also , it warns the need for regular monitoring of plasma concentration , accurate dosing , and identification of adherence issues in patients on phenytoin .
