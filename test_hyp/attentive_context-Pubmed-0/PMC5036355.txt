. however , we 
 experienced a rare complication of port - site recurrence that would not have occurred 
 with transsternal thymectomy .
a 60-year - old woman was referred to our hospital with an anterior mediastinal tumor on 
 computed tomography ( ct ) performed for follow - up 6 years after a complete response to 
 chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma .
a small - extent 
 resection of the skin and wide resection of the chest wall is therefore recommended when 
 performing surgery for port - site recurrence after vats thymectomy .
thymomas are the most common low - grade malignant tumors that often emerge in the 
 anterior mediastinum in adults . while 
 thymectomy by sternotomy is the traditional method of treating thymoma , recently , 
 video - assisted thoracic surgery ( vats ) approaches have been often selected .
vats thymectomy is reportedly feasible and 
 safe and is less invasive than transsternal thymectomy  
ishibashi et al .   successfully performed a curative operation in a case of port - site 
 recurrence via wide chest wall resection and reconstruction . in the process
ishibashi et al . 
 reported a case of port - site recurrence after a vats operation for type b2 thymoma 
 , to our knowledge , this is the only 
 such previous case report . the current type
