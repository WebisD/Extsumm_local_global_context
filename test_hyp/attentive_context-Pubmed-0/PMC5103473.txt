it was mentioned that corrosion has a detrimental effect on the physical properties of brackets and causes unwanted biological side effects ; therefore , brackets with minimal corrosion tendencies are more desirable . the present study aimed to investigate five different brands of stainless steel brackets and compare their tendency towards corrosion by measuring ion release in an in - vitro setting . 

due to the importance of the biocompatibility of orthodontic armamentaria , in the present study we chose five popular brackets among orthodontists and determined their susceptibility to corrosion by measuring ion release in anin - vitro environment .
based on the findings of the present study , regarding ion release levels , the org and ortho organizer brackets were superior while dentaurum and 3 m did not demonstrate any significant differences . 

the median levels of ion release were measured for chromium , iron , manganese and nickel using an icp device ( figure 1 ) .
the brackets and wires in this study were all manufactured from 18 - 8 stainless steel ( 18% chromium , 8% nickel ) . based on the results of this study , we found that except for manganese , the cobas bracket had the highest level of ion release .
