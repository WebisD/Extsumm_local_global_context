the mitral e , lateral , septal and mean e / em and the pcwp estimated from each of the e / em measurements were all significantly higher , whereas ps / pd , lateral and septal em and lateral and septal em / am were significantly lower in the patient group ( table 2 ) .
the purpose of the present study was to determine if ct-1 levels are significantly different in dhf patients compared to controls and to investigate the relationship between ct-1 and echocardiographic parameters .
ct-1 positively correlated with nt - probnp ( p=0.001 , r=0.349 ) , mean e / em ( p=0.003 , r=0.307 ) , and estimated mean pcwp ( p=0.001 , r=0.308 ) ( figure 1 ) . according to bivariate linear regression analyses , log ct-1 was predicted by left atrium diameter and log nt - probnp was predicted by age , creatinine clearance , and left atrium diameter ( table 3 ) . in multiple linear regression analysis ,
arterial blood pressures were also not different between the 2 groups . ct-1 and nt - probnp were significantly higher in the patient group ( ct-1 : 11.30   fmol / ml vs. 17.5   fmol / ml , p=0.017 ; nt - probnp : 64   pg / ml vs. 82   pg / ml , p=0.009 ) ( table 1 ) .
