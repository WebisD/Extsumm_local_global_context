19 children admitted with membranous tonsillitis in our hospital were identified as probable or confirmed cases of diphtheria with culture positivity in 13 children .
diphtheritic polyneuropathy ( dp ) is recognized as one of the most severe complications of diphtheria , caused by exotoxin of corynebacterium diphtheriae . among 20,000 cases of diphtheria reported by who during 20072011 , 17,926 ( 89.6% ) cases were from india alone .
scarce reports of dp in the indian literature may result from under - recognition and perhaps , under - reporting of this entity . in this paper , we present a case series of 13 children with dp from south india admitted in our hospital from july 2013 to december 2013 . during the same period ,
the simultaneous resurgence of clinical diphtheria in our area helped us probe into the history of those children who presented with neuropathy and throw light on this latent entity which is almost forgotten by the present day physicians and neurologists . in india , apart from the case series from delhi , there is no other case series reported so far in the recent past .
all the children had history of membranous tonsillitis with a latency period of 1540 days between the onset of tonsillitis and neurological symptoms .
