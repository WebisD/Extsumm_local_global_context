, the present study shows that when compared to mict , short - term brief hiit intervention with 8  s of high - intensity interval cycling interspersed with 12  s of rest is a more time - efficient approach and is perceived as being easier for improving aerobic fitness and blood glucose in sedentary overweight and obese young women .
after five weeks of exercise training , both hiit and mict resulted in a significant improvement in vo2peak ( p = 0.006 ;  = 0.38 ) and ppo ( p < 0.001 ;  = 0.61 ) .
there were no within - group or group differences in serum levels of testosterone , cortisol , the ratio of testosterone and cortisol ( t / c ratio ) , gh , leptin , or fgf-21 ( table 2 ) .
after the intervention , despite no significant changes in weight , bmi , total fat mass ( tfm ) , and total body fatness ( tbf ) for both groups , the mict group experienced significantly decreased total lean mass ( tlm ) ( 1.7  kg or 3.9% ; p = 0.011 ) and leg lm ( 0.6  kg or 3.3% , p = 0.018 ) .
