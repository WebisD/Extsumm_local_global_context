continued surveillance for antiviral drug resistance in influenza viruses is required to ensure that stockpiled neuraminidase inhibitors are effective and clinicians can be kept informed of the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors when treating patients for influenza .
however , majority of a / h1n1 viruses remained sensitive till 2006 season and 2 per cent of a / h1n1 viruses worldwide showed resistance to amantadine29 . in the present study , resistance to amantadine was mainly observed for a / h3n2 subtype , with identification of common mutation s31n of m2 gene . in the present study ,
though asn(n ) at position 151 has been associated with a reduction in the susceptibility of influenza a and b viruses to oseltamivir and/or zanamavir ; our study showed that the sensitive h3n2 viruses had either asp ( d),/asn ( n ) or gly ( g ) at residue 151 .
our results showed that the influenza b viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir with agreement to global data .
amantadine susceptibility testing of influenza a virus isolates ( 2004 - 2011 ) seasonal a ( h1n1 ) viruses - in contrast to a / h3n2 viruses most of a / h1n1 viruses remained sensitive to amantadine till mid 2007 ( table i ) .
