the present study was aimed to determine the epidemiology of malaria by comparison of microscopy and nested pcr .
incorrect speciation of p. falciparum and p. vivax was resolved by nested pcr in 8 samples ; p. falciparum was identified in 4 clinically and microscopically positive specimens that showed p. vivax infection by nested pcr ; and 4 p. vivax positive specimens were shown to be p. falciparum infection by nested pcr .
figure 1 is showing nested pcr result of three samples with p. falciparum , p. vivax and mixed infections .
compared to microscopy , the nested - pcr is a rapid , sensitive , and specific method for the detection of malaria . the primary goal of the present study was to assess the value of a pcr - based method for the routine diagnosis of malaria at species level and study was conducted to evaluate the epidemiology of malaria in south punjab .
was diagnosed by microscopy ; rather nested pcr determined mixed infections ( p. falciparum and p. vivax ) in 10 specimens .
species identification by nested pcr was done for all plasmodium positive samples ( 41% ) . out of which 15% were having p. falciparum infection , 16 were having p. vivax infection , and 10 were mixed infections ( p. falciparum and p. vivax ) .
