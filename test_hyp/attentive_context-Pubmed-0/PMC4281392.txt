the possibility of delivering intraoperative radiotherapy ( iort ) with electrons , without dedicated equipment , is very attractive . addressing this issue , the purpose of our paper was to assess the efficacy , toxicity , and cosmetic outcomes of iort delivered by standard linacs , during breast conserving surgeries for the treatment of early breast cancer .
selected patients with early infiltrating breast carcinomas may benefit from the technique , which may represent an interesting option for developing countries .
iort with electrons delivered by conventional linacs , immediately after a wide local excision , presented the expected results until now , with very good local control and cosmetic outcomes and a low toxicity rate .
of the 187 enrolled patients , 35 ( 18.7% ) were intraoperatively excluded because of sn positivity ( 18 patients ) , difficulty in obtaining clear margins ( 11 patients ) , multicentricity / multifocality ( 3 patients ) , muscle infiltration ( 1 patient ) , t3.0  cm ( 1 patient ) , and no sn identification ( 1 patient ) .
the cumulative incidence of lr as the first unfavorable event was 3.2% ( 95% ci : 0.88.1 ) ( figure 3 ) . among the 5 cases of lr in the entire cohort 4 were considered to be a tr , and one had a failure in a quadrant other than the index lesion at 30-month follow - up , consistent with spt . regarding other failures , two patients ( 1.3% ) developed distant metastases , three had axillary failure ( 1.9% ) , and one patient had a contralateral tumor ( 0.6% ) .
