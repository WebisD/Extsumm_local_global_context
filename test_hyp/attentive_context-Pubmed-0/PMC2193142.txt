because of the deficiency of apo e , these animals have high levels of plasma cholesterol and develop atherosclerosis with a reproducible time course 212223 . in a first experiment
atherosclerosis in apo e mice closely resembles that in humans with respect to histology , progression , and dependence on circulating cholesterol 23 , and we may thus speculate that infectious agents may not be necessary for the development of human atherosclerosis .
, we bred the apo e with a strain of mouse that is unable to respond to bacterial lps , but found no alteration in the rate or extent of atherogenesis . in a second study
recent reports suggest that inoculation of atherosclerosis - prone mice with high doses of chlamydia may cause an approximately twofold increase in the size of atherosclerotic lesions 3334 .
1 ) , a parameter that tracks with histological progression of atherosclerosis ( 23 ; data not shown ) . to determine a role for gram - negative bacteria such as chlamydia , we first used lps mice 27 , animals with a congenital deficiency in responses to the principal inflammatory component of these bacteria , lps ( endotoxin )
it is thus possible that infection may exacerbate atherosclerogenesis , and antibiotics may ameliorate atherogenesis not through the action of an etiologic agent , but through indirect effects on metabolism and known risk factors .
