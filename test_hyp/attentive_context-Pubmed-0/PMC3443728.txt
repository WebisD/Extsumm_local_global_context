the patient presented with typical angina and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an ischemic coronary event during the continuous infusion of 5-fu .
we present here a case of severe cardiotoxicity mimicking acute anterolateral myocardial infarction occurring in a patient receiving 5-fu chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the colon .
cardiotoxicity , a rare adverse effect of 5-fu , has a reported incidence of 1.2% to 18% .
the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil ( fu ) is widely used in the treatment of solid tumors , including gastrointestinal , breast , head , and neck cancers .
this case supports the vasospastic hypothesis of 5-fu cardiac toxicity , indicating that a calcium channel blocker may be effective for prevention or treatment of 5-fu cardiotoxicity .
the ischemia recurred when the infusion was stopped , and was relieved by administration of nitroglycerin followed by a sublingual calcium channel blocker .
the cessation of 5-fu administration and the subsequent initiation of treatment with a sublingual calcium channel blocker and nitrate resulted in a successful outcome .
percutaneous coronary intervention of the proximal lcx lesion was performed successfully with the implantation of a drug - eluting stent ( 3.5  16 mm ; taxus , national medical center , seoul , korea ) ( fig .
