thus , this study was conducted to determine the age- and sex - specific and total crude incidence rates of gastric cancer in marrakech and compare them to the rates in casablanca , the largest city with a population - based cancer registry in morocco .
the rates of gastric cancer in marrakech for all patients , males , and females were 5.50 , 7.19 , and 3.87 per 100,000 , respectively .
in conclusion , a significantly higher rate of gastric cancer was found in marrakech when compared to the rates of casablanca .
first , age - specific incidence rates of gastric cancer were higher in marrakech in nearly all age groups for both males and females compared to respective rates in casablanca .
adenocarcinoma represented 83% of the histological types of gastric cancer ; carcinoma and gastric intestinal stromal tumors represented 13% and 3% , respectively ( table 2 ) .
age ranges , rates of gastric cancer in marrakech were higher than the rates in casablanca .
notably , the difference in incidence in males between marrakech and casablanca was much more distinct than the difference in females . the incidence of the disease in marrakech could be higher than what is reported in this study because of the possible missed patients who did not seek medical care and die without diagnosis or documentation .
