the present report describes an interesting case of an osteolytic lesion ( actinomycosis ) after recovery from fulminant liver failure induced by aih .
when treating patients with fulminant liver failure due to aih , the possibility of such rare occurrences should be kept in mind . in conclusion , this report described an interesting case of an osteolytic lesion secondary to actinomycosis after fulminant liver failure induced by aih .
autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) is a chronic progressive hepatitis characterized by positive antinuclear antibody ( ana ) and hypergammaglobulinemia , portal inflammatory cell infiltration with plasmacyte dominance , and piecemeal necrosis 1 .
thus , the diagnosis of actinomycosis depends on growth of the bacteria in culture and the discovery of sulfur granules in the pathologic specimen . in this patient ,
, she was finally diagnosed with recovery from fulminant liver failure induced by acuteonset aih , likely type 1 aih . a nationwide survey of patients with fulminant hepatitis and lateonset hepatic failure in japan revealed that outcomes were especially poor in aih patients ( the survival rate was 17.1% without liver transplantation ) 9 .
the patient presented with severe pain of the right hip joint and was readmitted with suspicion of the osteonecrosis of the femoral head .
