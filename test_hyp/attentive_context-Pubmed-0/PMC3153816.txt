attentional focus has been differentially defined and utilized in both research and practice . for a fuller understanding of the role of task - specific attentional focusing instructions on force production in the future
any differences in the attentional focus emphasized in instructions and feedback provided may induce unplanned differences between and within conditions , participants , and trials . in terms of consistency in facilitating performance
the ability to generate maximal forces is critical to many sporting , rehabilitative , exercise , physical therapy , and physical testing settings and procedures . in all such settings , researchers , and practitioners
, a large body of research in the sport and exercise psychology literature does address the impact of attentional focus on endurance .
however , what has not been clear is the influence these instructions may have on participants attentional focus and subsequent performance . utilizing the vertical jump - and - reach task to assess maximal force production from whole - body coordination , wulf and
the maximal and accurate production and maintenance of forceful movements requires a complex interaction between cognitive , psychological , and physiological variables . of these many variables ,
colleagues have attempted to address the potential influences of attentional focusing instructions on maximum force production . in the initial study ,
