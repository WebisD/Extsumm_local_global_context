studies , as the one highlighted here , will help us to understand molecular regulation of fgf23 synthesis and identify its yet to be documented functions .
inadequate phosphate balance disrupts a multitude of physiological processes , and can cause or exacerbate age - associated disorders , cardiovascular calcification and bone mineralization defects .
physiologic phosphate balance is maintained by interactions among the intestine , kidney , parathyroid gland and bone .
1 ) . it is a well - accepted fact that pth can induce the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d in the kidney , and that , in turn , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d can inhibit pth secretion by the parathyroid glands .
optimal phosphate balance is important for many physiological functions from cell signaling to energy metabolism to skeletal mineralization .
recent studies have claimed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d can stimulate fgf23 production in bone and that fgf23 can suppress 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d production and pth secretion .
the ability of pth to directly stimulate fgf23 expression forms an endocrine regulatory feedback loop to control mineral ion metabolism .
the intestinal napi-2b activity is influenced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d , which can increase the expression of intestinal napi-2b protein to augment intestinal phosphate uptake by the enterocytes .
