delayed hospital presentation , severe loss of consciousness , acute toxicity in patients who were on daily dose of mtd ( acute on chronic toxicity ) , need for early endotracheal intubation , tachypnea ( as a sign of acute lung injury or aspiration pneumonitis ) , acute renal failure , and rhabdomyolysis can be assumed as early poor prognostic factors for mtd - related death .
this study aimed to describe the demographic data of mtd - overdosed patients and compare mtd - intoxicated survivors and nonsurvivors to investigate the possible prognostic factors in this toxicity .
in this retrospective , cross - sectional study , medical data of all mtd - poisoned patients older than 12 years who had been admitted to toxicology ward of loghman hakim hospital between 2007 and 2012 were evaluated .
finally , the patients were divided into two groups , those with acute toxicity after single ingestion of a dose of mtd for the first time ( suicide attempt or accidental ) and those with acute on chronic toxicity poisoning that were on daily doses of mtd and had ingested it more than the usual dose ( suicide attempt or recreational overdose ) .
