herein , we report an unusual case of periocular muscle atrophy and weakness secondary to unilateral topical bimatoprost use .
topical bimatoprost is a popular prostaglandin analog used primarily as a powerful ocular hypotensive agent for treatment of glaucoma ( approved in 2001 ) .
herein , we report an unusual and previously unreported case of upper eyelid ptosis secondary to levator muscle atrophy as a result of the chronic unilateral use of topical bimatoprost .
although this side effect may not be completely reversible with discontinuation of medication , this case shows that it may be successfully corrected with surgical intervention
a 58-year - old chinese female was referred to the oculoplastics services of national university hospital , singapore , for right upper eyelid ptosis of 1.5 years duration and difficulty in closing her right eye .
clinicians and patients should be aware of this , as it may compromise visual field and be potentially disfiguring , especially when used monocularly .
topical bimatoprost is highly efficacious and superior to many other anti - glaucoma eye drops.2,3 however , it commonly causes side effects such as ocular hyperemia , periocular and iris pigmentary changes , although these are mostly reversible with cessation of use.4 periorbital lipodystrophy resulting in periorbital hollowing , eyelid retraction , and enophthalmos from chronic use of bimatoprost has also been well - documented.58 upper eyelid sulcus deepening has been shown to occur significantly more frequently ( objectively and subjectively ) with bimatoprost use than with other prostaglandin analogs , namely latanoprost , tafluprost , and unoprostone.9 aihara et al reported an increased incidence of upper eyelid sulcus deepening in patients who were switched from latanoprost to bimatoprost , suggesting that the latter has a more potent effect on periorbital fat tissue.10 the term  prostaglandin - associated periorbitopathy  ( pap ) has been coined to describe the constellation of periorbital soft - tissue changes resulting from the use of topical prostaglandin analogs .
