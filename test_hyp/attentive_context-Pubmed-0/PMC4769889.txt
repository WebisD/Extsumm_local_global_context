on the other hand , the leucite and lithium groups showed comparatively high primary - tooth abrasivity levels , which if confirmed in vivo may suggest that they should be used with caution in pediatric dentistry .
tooth volume losses in the leucite and lithium groups were significantly greater than that in the steel group ( p < .05 ) , but no significant difference was observed between the steel group and the zirconia group ( p > .05 ) . in terms of weight losses of restorative materials after testing , the lithium group showed most at 0.006  0.002 g , followed by the leucite group ( 0.003  0.002 g ) and the steel and zirconia groups ( 0.002  0.001 g ) .
weight loss in the lithium group was significantly greater than in the steel and zirconia groups ( p < .05 ) , but no significant difference was observed between the steel , leucite , and zirconia groups ( p > .05 ) .
in vitro measured volumetric losses in the leucite and lithium groups were significantly greater than in the steel group , but no significant difference was found between the steel and zirconia groups . in this study , zirconia was the only material found to have an abrasivity that did not differ significantly from that of the steel used in conventional steel crowns .
