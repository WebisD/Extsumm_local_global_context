when compared with other famine studies , the chinese famine lasted much longer and affected more people . in conclusion , we found that exposure to severe famine in fetal life and infant period was associated with higher risk of metabolic syndrome in adulthood .
we found that exposure to chinese famine during fetal life and early childhood was associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome in later life .
the risks of metabolic syndrome among adults who were exposed to the famine during their early childhood were 2.85 ( 95% ci 1.196.83 , p = 0.019 ) and 0.91 ( 95% ci 0.551.51 , p = 0.72 ) in severely and less severely affected areas , respectively , with a significant interaction between famine cohort and area ( p for interaction = 0.026 ) ( table 1 ) .
1 . the fetal famine - exposed cohort with a western diet in later life had a particularly high prevalence of the metabolic syndrome ( 34.6% ) , whereas the prevalence among the fetal famine - exposed cohort with a traditional diet in later life was only 4.2% ( fig .
the prevalences of metabolic syndrome among adults in non- , fetal- , and early childhood , midchildhood- , and late childhood  exposed cohorts were 5.7 , 7.7 , 8.4 , 7.6 , and 8.9% , respectively , in 2002 .
