recently , we experienced the case of a nearly complete reversal of a hyper - acute large ischemic injury on dwi .
reversal or shrinkage of early ischemic injury demonstrated by diffusion - weighted mri ( dwi ) is clinically uncommon , even after early thrombolytic reperfusion therapy   .
the dwi - defined early ischemic injury physiologically represents an irreversible ischemic core and a potentially reversible surrounding area .
hyper - acute large ischemic injury demonstrated by dwi may very rarely represent a nearly perfect reversible area , and it may be a therapeutic target .
a 67-year - old previously healthy woman suddenly developed stupor and left hemiparesis , and arrived at our hospital 45 min after symptom onset . upon presentation , the national institute of heath stroke scale ( nihss ) score was 12 points , and baseline brain ct was perfectly normal .
an adc decline with an average of 86% in the dwi - defined ischemic area and early successful reperfusion may largely account for complete and sustained reversal , associated with a favorable clinical outcome . in conclusion ,
the systemic work - up including cardiac and hematological profiles revealed the presence of patent foramen ovale and venous thrombus in her leg , suggesting a paradoxical brain embolism as an etiological mechanism for this stroke .
