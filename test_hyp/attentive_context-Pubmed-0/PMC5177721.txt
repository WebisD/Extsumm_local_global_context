, we report a case of a 3-year - old boy presenting with left ventricular hypertrophy , who was diagnosed with idiopathic mas following identification of severely elevated blood pressure ( bp ) .
midaortic syndrome ( mas ) is a rare disease characterized by luminal narrowing of the abdominal aorta , and involves stenosis of the major branches in the abdomen . in 1963
however , the ptra success rate decreased with mas compared with isolated renal artery stenosis because of the extensive stenotic nature of the aorta and renal branches15 ) , even though ptra is successful in reducing hypertension by using different technical approaches in the arteries from one study3 ) . in conclusion , we report a 3-year - old boy presenting with left ventricular hypertrophy who was diagnosed with congenital mas following the identification of severely elevated bp . clinical suspicion and accurate examination , including bp measurement , would aid early diagnosis of mas and optimal treatment , and are important to prevent the fatal complications from hypertension .
we described a 3-year - old boy presenting with lv hypertrophy who was diagnosed with idiopathic mas following identification of severely elevated bp . to the best of our knowledge ,
