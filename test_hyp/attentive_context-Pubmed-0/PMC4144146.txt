given the above , the purpose of this paper is to review the dental literature that describes the main factors involving antimicrobial effects of pdt combined with conventional endodontic treatment in the total disinfection of the root canal system .
it could be concluded that pdt is presented as an important auxiliary tool to antimicrobial substances commonly used in endodontic treatment .
this treatment is based on the use of a nontoxic dye sensitive to light , followed by irradiation with a visible light source with a suitable wavelength in the presence of oxygen .
has demonstrated to be a great ally to conventional endodontic treatment in eliminating microorganisms that remain viable in root canal system .
one challenge that has motivated many researchers in recent years is to develop new technologies to eliminate these persistent microorganisms . among the new technologies , photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) , also known as photoactivated disinfection or photochemotherapy ,
the databases pubmed , isi web of knowledge and medline were used with specific indexing of the following terms : pdt , photoactivated disinfection , photochemotherapy , endodontics and root canal , and a subsequent search with specific limits and criteria were performed .
