nevertheless , the study on the effect 
 of resistance training on the brain function index in the elderly with alzheimer s 
 disease16 , 17 demonstrated that the brain index increased after exercise both in 
 the resistance training and gymnastics groups , thus supporting this study result .
first , the balance index of patients with dementia showed significant patterns in the 
 left - right asymmetry compared to that in the normal control group , as determined using the 
 spatio - temporal pattern analysis10 , and 
 the corpus callosum , which transmits information between the left and the right hemispheres , 
 became atrophied11 , and the hemispheric 
 disconnection syndrome could be explained .
