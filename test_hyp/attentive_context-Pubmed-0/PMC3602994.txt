this article affords a comprehensive review of leptin therapy , a new strategy now in clinical trials , and its beneficial role in hiv patients in correction of metabolic complications related to hals .
hiv - infected patients , especially on a long duration of antiretroviral therapy ( art ) , are now facing newer challenges in terms of developing pathological aberrations of fat metabolism and redistribution .
the two terms , hiv - associated adipose redistribution syndrome ( hars ) and hiv - associated lipodystrophy syndrome ( hals ) , possibly have the same connotation to describe an acquired ( ?
recombinant human leptin , still an investigational product , is not yet available commercially in the market for the patients suffering from hiv - associated lipodystrophy and metabolic complications .
the scope for its therapeutic utility is grossly suffering from lack of longer and larger well - furnished clinical trials from many countries worldwide .
however , it is only recently that the leptin  hypothalamic axis has newly been explored which regulates insulin and glucose metabolism independent of its effect on adiposity .
anabolic steroids , growth hormone ( gh ) , growth hormone releasing hormone ( ghrh ) , recombinant human leptin , and adiponectin ( synthetic form unavailable ) are the candidates for hormone therapy . for the last 15 years , much has been known about leptin biology .
