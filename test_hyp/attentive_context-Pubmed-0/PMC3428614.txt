the central aims of this study were to analyze changes in regional cbf in patients with tle in response to administration of etomidate and to examine its possible utility for diagnosis during presurgical evaluation .
we conclude that activation of bioelectrical activity and measurement of regional cbf in patients during presurgical evaluation could be of great utility in epilepsy units as a complementary test to increase the accuracy of diagnosis in patients being evaluated for tle .
examination of slices obtained from epileptic patients has revealed a decrease in the reversal potential for cl anions . this change could induce a depolarization instead of hyperpolarization following gaba release , thereby driving irritative activity .   on the other hand , studies in cultured astrocytes
the present study included 11 patients ( 5 women , 6 men ) who were diagnosed with intractable epilepsy of the mesial temporal lobe .
shortly after completion of etomidate administration , small increases in the amplitude and frequency were observed in the scalp eeg ( stage 1 ) , followed by generalized , large - amplitude delta activity ( stage 2 ) .
, etomidate leads to a brief increase in amplitude and frequency of brain activity , recorded by scalp eeg , followed by generalized high - voltage delta activity .
