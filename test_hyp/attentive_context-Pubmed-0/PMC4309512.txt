platform switching and conical implant - abutment connections have both been contributory to the maintenance of the peri - implant bone . within the limits of this 1-year prospective clinical study ,
mean marginal bone level change at 12 months was similar for the ps ( 0.04    0.08  mm ) and nps ( 0.19    0.16  mm ) groups .
comparison of marginal bone level changes ( mblcs ) at different time intervals between the ps and the nps groups ( 03 , 06 , 012 , 36 , 312 , 612  months ) using mann 
evidence from this study suggests that peri - implant marginal bone level change may not be related to the platform switch feature as much as the seal at the implant  abutment interface .
comparison of the overall marginal bone level ( mbl ) and marginal bone level change ( mblc ) at different time intervals for the nps group using friedman test with post hoc pairwise comparisons at   =  0.05 statistically significant difference .
in this study , all implants remained osseointegration at 1 year , corresponding to a 100% ( 30/30 ) implant success rate .
insertion torque of < 35  ncm was observed with 4 implants during placement , and they were not included in the study .
