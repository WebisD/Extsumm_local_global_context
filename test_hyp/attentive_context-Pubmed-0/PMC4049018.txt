our case was diagnosed with a primary ccs in the mediastinum . a search of the english literature revealed only one previously reported case of primary ccs in the mediastinum .
ccs occurs most commonly in the deep soft tissues of the extremities , with rare involvement of the head , neck , and trunk .
recent cytogenetic studies showed that ccs is associated with the translocation t(12;22 ) ( q13;q12 ) ; this translocation is observed in up to 93% of patients with ccs , but never observed in malignant melanoma . in our case
ccs occurs most commonly in adolescents and young adults and the patients aged > 60 years are rare .
