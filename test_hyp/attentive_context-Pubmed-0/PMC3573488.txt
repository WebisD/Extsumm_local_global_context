easy availability of imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and magnetic resonance venography ( mrv ) along with increasing awareness of condition should make it more frequently diagnosed , with scope of its reversal with timely treatment .
cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) in children is a rare complication and only few cases have been reported.  following two cases demonstrate this rare complication .
a 4-year - old boy , weighing 14 kg with steroid - responsive nephrotic syndrome of 1-year duration developed vomiting and drowsiness for 2 days , with fresh re - appearance of edema ( relapse of nephrotic state ) .
thromboembolism in patients with nephrotic syndrome is a well - known complication because of hypercoagulable state and many other factors like hemoconcentration , increased blood viscosity , hypoalbuminemia , alteration in platelet function , and possibly administration of steroids and/or diuretics .
hence , a high degree of suspicion is required , and a diagnosis of cvst should be considered in any child of nephrotic syndrome presenting with features of central nervous system involvement .
mri and mr venography is a better way of imaging as compared to ct scan .
