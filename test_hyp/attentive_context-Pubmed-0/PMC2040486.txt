folwarczny , in 1858 , was the first to demonstrate lactic acid in blood in a  living patient .
lactic acid was first found and described in sour milk by the swedish chemist karl wilhelm scheele ( 17421786 ) in 1780  .
it was the german physician  chemist johann joseph scherer who first demonstrated the occurrence of lactic acid in human blood under pathological conditions after death in 1843 and 1851    , and carl folwarczny in 1858 who first demonstrated lactic acid in blood of a  living patient . in this article
the swedish chemist jns jakob berzelius ( 17791848 ) found lactic acid in fluid extracted from meat in 1808    , and the german chemist justus von liebig ( 18031873 ) , who established the world 's first school of chemistry at giessen , proved that lactic acid was always present in muscular tissue of dead organisms  . in 1859 , emil heinrich du bois - reymond ( 18181896 ) published several articles on the influence of lactic acid on muscle contraction    .
we wish to honour scherer 's forgotten observations and describe the influence of his finding on further research on lactic acid at the end of the 19th century .
