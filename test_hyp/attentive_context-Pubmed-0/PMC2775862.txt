we decided to investigate whether recently made , easily available recombinant human -galactosidase a has same enzymatic activity as green coffee bean -galactosidase , and whether the recombinant enzyme can effectively eradicate -gal epitopes on the cell surface of porcine aortic valve and pericardium . additionally , we used standard indirect immunoperoxidase avidin - biotin technique in detecting -gals on cell surface instead of previously used immunofluorescent method .
thus with this recombinant enzyme , -gal deficient , more durable tissue valves can be made more economically in the future .
, we conclude that -gal epitopes can be removed from the porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue using the recombinant human -galactosidase a as effectively as using green coffee bean -galactosidase .
, we could conclude that about 5.0 unit / ml concentration of recombinant -galactosidase a with reaction conditions of ph 5.0 , temperature 4 , 24 hr of incubation was enough to remove all -gal epitopes from cell surface of porcine aortic valve . on the other hand , in porcine pericardial tissue , enzyme concentration of 1.0 unit / ml ( fig .
therefore , in porcine pericardial tissue , the more recombinant -galactosidase a was needed to remove all -gal epitopes from cell surface than that needed in aortic valve .
