during the past decade , radiofrequency catheter ablation has emerged as an effective therapy for ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( arvc). one of the major challenges in mapping and ablation is vt non - inducibility . although conventional vt induction protocols including extra - stimuli and low rate ( < 250 beats / min ) , incremental stimulation were widely used , a considerable number of patients were still non - inducible . , the anatomic and electrophysiologic substrates of vt vary widely in different diseases , which may lead to inconsistent results of vt induction . fast rate (  250 beats / min ) burst stimulation is rarely used for vt induction in structural heart diseases for security consideration . in particular , few study focused on this field in arvc due to the low prevalence up to now .
this study aimed to evaluate the value of fast rate (  250 beats / min ) right ventricular burst stimulation for vt induction in arvc , which was by no mean to deny the conventional vt induction protocols but just wanted to contribute an additional tool .
although conventional vt induction protocols including extra - stimuli and incremental stimulation ( < 250 beats / min ) had been found to increase the yield of inducible vt in a group of diseases , a number of variables including different numbers of extra - stimuli , drive cycle length , current strength and sites of stimulation have been performed , lack of control of those variables has led to a significant variability in reported sensitivity , specificity and reproducibility .
