this pilot study aims at determining the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in the antwerp population .
, we found that low vitamin d levels in the antwerp population are frequent and that there is an effect of the seasonal moment of the year and degree of sun exposure .
low vitamin d levels are frequently found in pregnancy but the optimal serum concentration remains unknown .
the mean of the partially veiled group , 17,2    7,2 ( sd ) ng / ml , was significantly lower than the mean of the non - veiled group ( t - test , p  =  0,001 ) .
this suggests a widespread shortage of vitamin d in our population , 1,75% was suffering from severe deficiency , 9,9% had moderate deficiency and 18,1% had mild deficiency .
the mean of the completely veiled group , being 22,5   12,9 ( sd ) ng / ml was not significantly higher than that of the partially veiled group and not significantly lower than the non - veiled group ( t - test , p  >  0,05 ) .
the mean vitamin d value of our population , 28  ng / ml , was below the reference range used in our laboratory .
