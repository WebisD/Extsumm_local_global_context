mucoepidermoid carcinoma ( mec ) is the most common malignant tumor of salivary glands and comprises approximately 5% of all salivary gland tumors .
laryngeal cases comprise one third of malignant laryngeal salivary - type tumors.1 however , it is a rare entity in the larynx and is frequently misdiagnosed as other laryngeal tumors . therefore , recognizing its clinical and histological features and distinguishing it from other common laryngeal malignancies are essential .
recurrence must be considered and combination of radical surgery , radical neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy is recommended .
histological and clinical features of two major differential diagnoses , squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) and adenosquamous carcinoma ( asc ) , are also presented .
mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare entity in the larynx and is frequently misdiagnosed with other laryngeal malignancies especially squamous cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma . therefore , recognizing the distinct clinical and histological features of this tumor is essential .
in addition to the possibility of sampling errors , interpretative errors of tumor specimens have been reported.8 laryngeal mecs occur in people of all ages ( peak incidence in the 6th decade ) and rare cases have been reported in children and adolescents.9,10 this tumor has a definite male predominance and has a wide spectrum of clinical behavior from locally invasive to highly malignant.11,12 nearly half of the cases develop cervical lymph node involvement;10,13,14 and the lungs are the most frequent site for distant metastasis.12 an extremely rare case of metastatic laryngeal mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the temporal bone has also been reported.15
