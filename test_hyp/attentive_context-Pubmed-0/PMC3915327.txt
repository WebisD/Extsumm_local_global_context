therefore , rge may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of h.  pylori - associated gastric inflammation .
, rge supplementation inhibits neutrophil infiltration and lipid peroxidation , determined by mpo activity and lpo level , and attenuates the induction of inflammatory mediators ( kc , il-1 , inos ) , which results in suppression of h.  pylori - induced gastric inflammation in mongolian gerbils .
the results suggest that rge inhibits the expression of kc , il-1 , and inos in the h.  pylori - infected gastric mucosal tissues of mongolian gerbils by suppressing the phosphorylation of ib , and thus inhibits nf-b activation .
rge supplementation suppressed the h.  pylori - induced increase in the lpo level of gastric mucosal tissues . to investigate the inhibitory effects of rge against h.  pylori - induced inflammation , the expression levels of important inflammatory mediators ( kc , il-1 , inos )
rge moderated the h.  pylori - induced increase in neutrophil infiltration , mpo activity , lpo level , and the expression of inflammatory mediators ( kc , il-1 , inos ) .
in addition , viable h.  pylori colonization in the stomach , changes in food intake and body weight , stomach weight / total body weight , and histological analysis of gastric mucosa were compared between animals that received rge and those that did not .
