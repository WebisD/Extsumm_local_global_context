computational methods have been of great use in understanding the role that g - quadruplexes may play in biology , unveiling their function in gene promoters   and in regulating translation .
a series of international conferences has been initiated , the first two hosted in louisville , ky   . at the first of these , it was suggested that a central and coherent website to store and provide data related to g - quadruplexes should be produced , and we volunteered to provide such a repository , hosted at the url http://www.quadruplex.org/. here , we describe the features available at that website , and in particular the core databases to describe predicted g - quadruplexes , and a new tool to estimate the thermal stability of these structures computationally .
a dedicated book has been produced ,   together with special issues of some journals focused on this topic , and some databases on particular aspects of g - quadruplexes .
we also describe the other online sources of predictive data for g - quadruplexes , so that researchers may chose the most appropriate tool for their work .
stability predictions have been used to develop experimental methods to directly visualise g - quadruplexes using afm .
