the present study is the largest series discussing the cytology of gists and egist from different anatomic sites including extremely rare sites like subcutaneous nodules , fluid cytology samples and metastasis from a primary pancreatic egist . in the present study we studied the cytomorphological features in 33 gist / egist from 27 patients .
the diagnosis of gist should also be considered in aspirates of the gastrointestinal tract , liver , mesentery , or abdominal wall mass lesions when epithelioid cells are the predominant cell type .
the presence of cellular dyscohesion , nuclear pleomorphism , necrosis and mitosis suggest malignant behavior , however absence of these features on cytology is not diagnostic of low risk benign behavior .
gist show a broad morphologic spectrum on cytology and gist should be considered as a differential diagnosis of tumors with spindle or epithelioid morphology . in an appropriate clinical and radiologic setting the presence of closely packed spindle or oval cells forming fascicles with parallel side - by - side arrangements of nuclei suggests gist .
the cytological studies on gist in literature are not comparable as many of the earlier published cytologic studies have combined gist into a group of neoplasms encompassing leiomyoma , schwannoma , leiomyosarcoma , and an epithelioid leiomyoblastoma.  however recently , few authors have established fnac as a reliable method for diagnosing gist and egist before surgical procedure [ table 1].  we observed several morphologic features suggestive of high grade gist and egist . in recurrent , metastatic and malignant gist
