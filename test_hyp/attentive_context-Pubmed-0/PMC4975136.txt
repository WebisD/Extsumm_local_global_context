corneal epithelium - like structure was used to simulate the human eye , and we evaluated dna microarray and real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) analysis results from normal human corneal epithelial cells exposed to water - filtered broad - spectrum nir irradiation to simulate solar nir radiation that reaches the eye .
we hypothesized that nir irradiation simulating solar nir radiation that reaches human tissues can induce changes in gene expression . to test this hypothesis , a three - dimensional reconstructed human corneal epithelial model with multilayered ,
meanwhile , when the expression of egfr variants was assessed in a dna microarray analysis , expression increased by 1.0-fold and 1.3-fold for egfr variants 1 and 3 , respectively . upon inclusion of variant - specific primer sequences for egfr ( table 2 ) , quantitative real - time pcr analysis revealed that statistically significant upregulation of variants 1 and 3 was observed ( p<0.05 ) , whereas there was no statistically significant upregulation of variants 2 and 4 ( p=0.1266 and p=0.5127 , respectively ) ( figure 2 ) .
egfr showed a high degree of upregulation ( 19.4-fold ) relative to control cells , although statistically significant upregulation of egfr and ttll5 was not observed ( p=0.5127 and p=0.8273 , respectively ) ( figure 1 ) using the primer sequences listed in table 1 .
