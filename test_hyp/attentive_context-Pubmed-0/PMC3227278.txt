within the limitations of the present study , it can be concluded that overall , 36% of mandibular incisors in this north - east indian population had two canals . in the teeth with two canals ,
the type iii canal system was the most prevalent followed by type ii.type v was the least prevalent .
although two canals were found in 36% of teeth , only 6.25% of canals exited in two separate foramina ( type v ) [ table 1 ] . out of all the canals showing two canal configuration , around 83% joined and exited in single foramen ( type ii and iii ) and remaining 17% exited in two separate foramina ( type v ) [ table 1].the apical foramen was found to coincide with the apical root tip in 47.2% of teeth [ table 2 ] . in the present study
