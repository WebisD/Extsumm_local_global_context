we report our pursuit of cart for refractory ascites in sbp after finding that ascites were negative for endotoxins .
a 58-year - old japanese male with end - stage renal failure due to chronic glomerulonephritis and receiving chronic hemodialysis since 1980 underwent kidney transplantation from an unrelated donor in october 1998 .
though administration of prednisolone ( 7.5 mg / day ) as immunosuppressive therapy may have prevented occurrence of a temporary fever , we believe that cart is a safe treatment even for endotoxin - negative sbp patients .
refractory ascites causes abdominal distention , abdominal pain and dyspnea and thereby aggravates patient quality of life and activities of daily living .
the advantages of this method are that albumin transfusion can be employed sparingly , and the risk of infection or allergic reaction is thus reduced . however , cart is dangerous to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( sbp ) patients because inadvertent reinfusion of filtrated , concentrated endotoxins in ascites has caused adverse effects of temporary fever and shock .
cell - free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy ( cart ) is a treatment which maintains albumin and globulin by filtration , concentration , and reinfusion of drained ascites .
