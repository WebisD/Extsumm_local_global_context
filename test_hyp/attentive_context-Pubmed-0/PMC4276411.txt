the purpose of the present mini - review is to highlight the present gaps in our understanding of the impact of ckd on non - renal drug clearance involving metabolism and transport processes and to identify areas of opportunity for future research .
these data along with a large body of earlier literature suggest that ckd alters the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are cleared by non - renal mechanisms ; however , the underlying molecular mechanisms accounting for these pharmacokinetic changes remain poorly defined ( reviewed by nolin , leblond and others ) .
chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) is a public health problem that affects more than 20 million people in the us .
despite the large number of patients affected and the devastating consequences of medication related problems , our understanding of the impact of kidney disease on drug disposition is incomplete , particularly for those drugs eliminated primarily by non - renal pathways . obviously , clearance of drugs that depend primarily on the kidneys for elimination is reduced , but significant changes also occur in drug exposure with medications that are eliminated by the liver , intestine , and possibly other organs . in 2009 , the fda published a survey of new drug applications ( nda ) approved between january 2003 and july 2007 that assessed the impact of renal impairment on systemic exposure of new molecular entities . in this analysis ,
