a 75-year - old male farmer presented to a primary care skin cancer practice in west australia with a 6-month history of an enlarging painless lesion on his left cheek with no history of any possible precursor lesion .
association with a bcc is a previously reported , unusual variation , consistent with both lesions having hair - follicle derivation .
there was a past history of treatment of two separate squamous cell carcinomas in - situ , one on the forehead and the other on an ear , in the previous two years .
trichilemmoma is a benign tumor derived from the external sheath cells of pilosebaceous units   and desmoplastic trichilemmoma is a rare variant , which can present clinically with features suggesting invasive malignancy .
examination showed a single small non - pigmented nodular lesion located on the left cheek in continuation with a small , pigmented macular lesion ( figure 1 ) .
this case demonstrates the utility of using a decision algorithm in esoteric cases with the final diagnosis to be delivered by the gold standard of dermatopathology .
trichilemmoma has previously been reported in association with bcc in the context of lesions arising in a preexisting nevus sebaceous .
