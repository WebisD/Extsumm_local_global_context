sequence - based nucleic - acid tests that can discriminate between lgv serovars and less invasive c. trachomatis species can help detect cases and prevent further transmission of lgv . in conclusion , our results suggest that we are dealing with the same lgv variant > 25 years later , and the current lgv outbreak in industrialized countries has most likely been a slowly evolving epidemic with an organism that has gone unnoticed in the community for many years and is now being detected by new technologies .
the l2b lgv variant identified as the cause of all the lgv proctitis in the recent outbreak among msm in amsterdam appears to have been circulating in amsterdam in 2000 .
since lgv causes potentially severe infections with possibly irreversible sequelae if adequate treatment is not begun promptly , early and accurate diagnosis is essential .
moreover , we showed that this l2b variant was present in the 1980s in san francisco with exactly the same mutations in the complete ompa gene .
the numbers detected in 2005 in amsterdam suggest that a considerable reservoir exists , which emphasizes the need for ongoing public health awareness .
however , since we only sequenced the ompa gene , and although the sequence was identical in old and new l2b strains , we can not exclude the possibility that it could involve different strains of c. trachomatis that differ in other parts of the genome , although this is unlikely .
