we describe an elderly man with nonmetastatic gastric adenocarcinoma presenting with an acquired variant of darier 's disease presumably of paraneoplastic origin .
darier 's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder of keratinization affecting the skin , mucosa , and nails that typically manifests in the first and second decade of life .
there is only a single case report on its association with metastatic papillary carcinoma of thyroid .
darier 's disease is an unusual paraneoplastic manifestation in gastric malignancy , not reported before .
its paraneoplastic association with gastric adenocarcinoma is very unusual and not known to be mentioned in any dermatology literature so far and hence reported here .
a 62-year - old muslim farmer was in otherwise good health until 2 months back when he suddenly started noticing some dark - colored , mildly itchy skin eruption .
this further served as an eye - opener for the clinical investigators of this case .
paraneoplastic dermatoses describes those benign skin changes in which there is a direct , often parallel course of a dermatosis with an underlying malignancy .
our case involves an acquired form of darier 's disease whose diagnosis was supported both clinically and histopathologically .
