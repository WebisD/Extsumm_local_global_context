the objective of this study was to evaluate the cost - effectiveness of etoricoxib ( 90  mg ) compared to celecoxib ( 200 and 400  mg ) , diclofenac ( 150  mg ) , and naproxen ( 1000  mg ) in the treatment of patients with as in norway .
a previously published markov - state transition model was used to estimate the cost - effectiveness of etoricoxib versus celecoxib and nsnsaids in the treatment of as patients requiring daily nsaid treatment . the model consisted of eight health states reflecting treatment received : ( 1 )  initial nsaid 
( etoricoxib , celecoxib , or nsnsaids , depending on intervention arm of the model ) , ( 2 )  initial nsaid with proton - pump inhibitor ( ppi ) ,  ( 3 ) alternative nsnsaids with ppi , ( 4 ) alternative nsnsaid with ppi and aspirin , ( 5 ) alternative nsnsaid , ( 6 ) anti - tnf treatment , ( 7 ) discontinued anti - tnf treatment , and ( 8) death .
although the cost - effectiveness findings in this study were primarily driven by differences in efficacy of the compared interventions , the cost - effectiveness of the different nsaids for the management of ankylosing spondylitis in other countries needs to be confirmed with country - specific analysis . in conclusion ,
