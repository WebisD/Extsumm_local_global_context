we have recently reported cross - sectional cognitive and neuroimaging studies as well as conducted longitudinal observations to examine clinical and brain changes in uhr individuals . throughout this review ,
we first discuss the most consistent findings in uhr individuals and then examine brain structural alterations as illness - onset markers , followed by suggestions for future directions of neuroimaging studies in uhr individuals .
over the past two decades , structural mri studies of uhr individuals have become a major approach to identify the neurobiological basis , underlying risk of , and conversion to schizophrenia .
advances in neuroimaging technologies and a ultra - high - risk ( uhr ) strategy that uses clinical - state - based criteria for identifying prodromal individuals , has resulted in renewed interest in brain development associated with the course of schizophrenia because the advances in research provide important insight into how brain changes occur ( 3 ) .
neuroimaging research has consolidated its position as the major approach to investigate the human brain in vivo and has contributed to the improvement of knowledge about the biological basis of psychosis , especially schizophrenia .
such deficits precede the onset of illness and certain events such as an intense or prolonged stressor or other environmental factors might exacerbate these deficits . alternatively , such deficits could mark the onset of illness ( 5 , 6 ) . in this paper , we review the recent literature on brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) changes in individuals at uhr for psychosis .
