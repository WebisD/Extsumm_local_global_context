primary correlates of faix were w2 ( r = 0.52 , p < 0.05 ) , carotid wia logrix ( r = 0.56 , p < 0.05 ) , carotid pressure aix ( r = 0.60 , p < 0.05 ) , and carotid wsa rix ( r = 0.63 , p < 0.05 ) . faix was not directly associated with carotid imt , carotid stiffness ( measured as pwv ) , carotid shear , carotid pulsatility index , cerebral pulsatility index , and aortic stiffness ( pwv ) nor was it associated with aortic pressure aix ( p > 0.05 ) .
correlates of the individual carotid velocity components that comprise faix are presented in table 3 . of interest , vsr was inversely correlated with w2 ( p < 0.05 ) and positively correlated with aortic aix ( p < 0.05 ) and aortic rix ( p < 0.05 ) .
tix was associated with aortic pwv ( r = 0.66 , p < 0.05 ) , cca shear ( r = 0.53 , p < 0.05 ) , cca imt ( r = 0.56 , p < 0.05 ) , cca pulsatility ( r = 0.48 , p < 0.05 ) , and mca pulsatility ( r = 0.39 , p = 0.06 ) .
