problems associated with frc - prostheses can be grouped under the following categories : gray/ metal shadow due to metal posts and cores or amalgam cores on abutment teeth ; loss of surface shining on the particulate veneering composite ; excessive translucency in pontic areas ; fracture or chipping of the particulate composite veneer and debonding of the retainer . the correct design of the frc framework and the use of high quality preimpregnated glass fibers in optimum quantity reduce the possibility of framework fractures .
prostheses are the subject of this article and generally consist of a particulate composite veneer supported by a frc - substructure ( framework ) . with frc prostheses ,
fortunately , these problems can now be overcome , to a large extent , by the use of fiber reinforced composite ( frc ) .
two somewhat different metalfree approaches to fixed tooth replacement continue to be developed for a variety of clinical applications .
veneering composite chipping can be avoided by using thicker layer ( 12 mm ) of composite resin on the surface of frc framework.17 although there are some failures that have been associated to frc bridges made earlier , these failures are in the majority of cases repaired by composite technology in the patient 's mouth . when a failure is observed , the dentist needs to analyze its reason and repair the device accordingly .
