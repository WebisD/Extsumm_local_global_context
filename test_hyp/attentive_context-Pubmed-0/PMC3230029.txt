we herein introduce a korean girl with typical features of scn and a novel elane gene mutation .
a 9-month - old girl who was born on september 17th , 2009 was transferred to our hospital with prolonged fever and recurrent cervical lymphadenitis on june 25th , 2010 .
severe chronic neutropenia is a congenital condition defined as an absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) of less than 500/l for at least three months ( 1 , 2 ) . generally ,
, severe congenital neutropenia ( scn ) is an inborn disorder with maturation arrest of the early stage of granulopoiesis associated with various genetic abnormalities ( 3 ) .
the variants of the elane sequence comprise approximately 50% of the genetic causes of scn and nearly all of cn ( 4 ) , and it is known to be correlated with more severe neutropenia and serious clinical manifestations in scn ( 5 ) .
in addition , cyclic neutropenia ( cn ) is a related disorder characterized by periodic oscillation of the peripheral neutrophil count , with an average 21-day frequency ( 1 , 2 ) . among several associated genetic mutations ,
since she has no siblings and is very young , we closely follow her , with the idea of stem cell transplantation in reserve .
