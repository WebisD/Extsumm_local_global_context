this article describes ivistmsa , which is a software package of seven graphical tools for multiple sequence alignments .
all tools allow the user to load tens of thousands of sequences to edit / analyze and compare them .
multiple sequence alignments ( msas ) are an essential first step for a number of computational approaches such as protein secondary structure / function prediction , phylogeny inference , and many other common tasks in sequence analysis.15 several software tools for generating multiple sequence alignments are available,6 but none of them is suitable for all types of data sets.7 consequently , in order to generate a true alignment , a need rises for inspection and adjusting alignments by hand , which is a very laborious job.5 furthermore , handling hundreds of thousands of alignments is another problem in the domain of bioinformatics .
ivistmsa implemented a divide - and - conquer ( dnc ) approach to calculate efficiently consensus / conserved sequences , identity matrix , sum - of - pairs score ( sps ) , colum score ( cs ) , and conserved regions of two alignments .
replication was done in order to save time and avoid from constructing big alignments from an msa method .
