the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of three different luting protocols ( total - etch , self - etch , and self - adhesive ) on shear bond strength of cad / cam rnc material , based on cad / cam technology , to dentin .
as showed in figure 3 , post - hoc tukey testing showed that the highest shear strength values ( p < 0.001 ) were reported in group 2 ( ult - se ) .
within the limitations of this in vitro study , conventional resin cements ( coupled with etch and rinse or self - etch adhesives ) showed better shear strength values compared to self - adhesive resin cements .
further studies should be conducted to test the correlation of bond strength for both tested materials to 48 h , 1 week , 1 month , and 1 year to evaluate the time factor related to the effective quality of bonding between ceramic material and dentin .
when comparing the shear bond strength values of conventional resin cements used together with an etch and rinse adhesive or with a self - etch adhesive , significantly higher bond strength values were recorded in group 2 ( self - etch protocol ) .
