furthermore , it can increase muscle strength and improve mobility as well as physical functioning in the elderly.7 several studies have investigated exercise programs for the very elderly and found moderate to very high improvements in muscle strength , balance , gait speed , and other outcomes that are indispensable for an independent life.810 however , most studies examined healthy and community dwelling elderly,1113 whereas persons with impaired physical ability as well as nursing - home residents or persons in long - term care facilities were underrepresented.14 a recent systematic review on the effects of progressive resistance training in elderly nursing - home residents showed that the intensity of the training should be vigorous and the duration at least 2 months.15 most authors describe a frequency of three training sessions per week , but the optimal frequency has not been defined.1619 therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate how much progressive strength training twice a week over a period of 8 weeks improves mobility , muscle strength , and quality of life in nursing - home residents with impaired mobility aged 75 years and older .
muscle strength ( eight - repetition maximum ) increased at every machine ( table 2 ) . at the rowing machine and the leg extension machine ,
