the purpose of current study was to identify characteristic of low - adherent bmmscs obtained by quantification of extracellular matrix and know the response of low - adherent mscs on titanium ( ti ) surfaces .
in conclusion , 7 days culturing of adherent bmmscs derived ecm was an appropriate microenvironment of obtaining non - adherent bone marrow cells .
we confirmed in this study that a method of acquisition of low - adherent bmmscs using ecm coated dishes were effective in increasing cell numbers and shortening the cell culture time and maintaining stemness of the stem cells .
low - adherent bmmscs acquired by 7 days culturing of adherent bmmscs derived ecm coated dishes can adhere , proliferate and differentiate into specialized cell lineages and have function in bone formation .
, newly formed bone tissues were seen in ha / tcp loaded with either adherent ( fig .
it was well known that mscs lose their capability to proliferation as well as their differentiation potentiality upon long time culturing on plastic culture dish.25 in our study , we showed non - adherent cells cultured on ecm coated dishes made by adherent bmmscs exhibited higher cfu - f number than freshly isolated bm cells cultured on plastic dishes .
