we report a case of myotubular myopathy in a neonate with a splice site mutation of mtm1 gene at the intron 10 region .
myotubular myopathy ( mtm ) is an x - linked congenital disorder ( xlmtm ) that is caused by mtm1 mutation1 ) . in this condition ,
we report that a neonate initially misdiagnosed with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy was diagnosed with a xlmtm with a splice site mutation of mtm1 gene at the intron 10 region .
when a floppy infant is regarded to have hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy based on a perinatal circumstantial evidence , an accurate diagnosis should be established by carrying out appropriate clinical procedures . if a neuromuscular disorder is suspected , a muscle biopsy should be done .
however , only one case was reported with regard to the genetic analysis of mtm in the korean population10 ) . here
mutations in the mtm1 gene encoding myotubularin cause xlmtm , a well - defined subtype of human centronuclear myopathy4 ) .
clinical characterization of xlmtm has been comprehensive and the disorder has been found to give rise to a severe phenotype in males .
a 2,930 gm male was born at 37 weeks and 5 days gestation age via emergency cesarean section in a local hospital .
