further studies on the bmd - like myopathy and ms with the present immunostaining method as one of the keys for examining muscular disorders are required in order to prevent economic loss and to ascertain the possibility of a bmd model using a pig .
based on the results of the histological and immunofluorescent analyses , the present case was diagnosed with bmd - like myopathy associated with dystrophin abnormality in a pig .
this is the first report of a natural case of myopathy associated with dystrophin abnormality in a pig .
a lot of issues , such as the prevalence , genetic factors , pedigree and the systemic analysis of muscles , including heart , still remain unclear in our understanding of the bmd - like myopathy in a pig .
the results in this study implied an inherited factor as one of the causes of ms and the possible occurrence of the human bmd homolog in pigs .
considering the fat infiltration is not a particular lesion in the skeletal muscle but is sequel after the muscular disorder , ms may consist of diverse collection of muscular disorders including the bmd - like myopathy .
the stainability of the dystrophin in the muscular tissue of the present case was revealed to be declined and patchy at the sarcolemma by immunofluorescent staining .
