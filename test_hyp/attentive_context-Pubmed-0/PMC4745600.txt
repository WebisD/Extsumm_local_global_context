, we tested the effect of interferon proteins and of th1 , th2 , and th17 cytokines on the mucosal barrier structure and function of primary nasal epithelial cells harvested from nasal polyps of crs patients .
in contrast , the th17 cytokines family ( il-17 , il-22 , and il-26 ) showed significant disruption of the epithelial barrier , leading to increased paracellular permeability associated with reduced tight junctionintegrity . in future studies , it will be important to determine the cellular mechanism of the effect of th17 cytokines on the mucosal barrier in crs patients to provide an opportunity for therapeutic modulation in inflammatory stress .
the effect of interferons and of th1 , th2 , and th17 cytokines on cellular toxicity was examined by measuring ldh release from hnecs .
the effect of interferon proteins and of th1 , th2 , and th17 cytokines on the localization of zona occludens-1 ( zo-1 ) was examined by using immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy , 24 hours after application of the cytokines . in untreated cells ,
th1 and th2 cytokines and interferons  ,  , and  did not show any significant effect on the paracellular permeability in crs patients ( figure 2 ) .
