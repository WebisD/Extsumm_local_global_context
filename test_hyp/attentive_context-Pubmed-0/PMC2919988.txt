we report a case achieving long - term complete remission under fulvestrant introduced after no or poor response to prior endocrine therapies , in whom the most efficacious dosing regimen was below the approved dose .
in january 1993 , a 47-year - old , premenopausal woman was diagnosed with a left breast cancer ( pt1c(m)pn0m0 ) after bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy for relapsing fibroadenomas .
we therefore hypothesize an extraordinary sensitivity , but not a metabolic phenomenon as a key factor in the observations made in this case .
fulvestrant ( faslodex ; astrazeneca ) is a novel steroidal estrogen receptor ( er ) antagonist lacking agonist effects . by covalent binding to the er , receptors are rapidly downregulated , resulting in a decrease of cellular er levels and complete abrogation of estrogen - sensitive gene transcription .
two recent clinical trials are focusing on fulvestrant high - dose regimens ( 500 mg monthly ) to optimize fulvestrant treatment .
this case is remarkable in several aspects : first , achievement of long - lasting complete remission ( last reconfirmed 90 months after treatment start ) is very rare , especially after no or poor response to prior anastrozole / tamoxifen , obviously both not predictive for the efficacy of fulvestrant in this patient .
