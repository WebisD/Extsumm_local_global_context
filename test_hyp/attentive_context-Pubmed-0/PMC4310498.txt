level of adamts-7 is elevated in articular cartilage of osteonecrosis of femoral head ; admats-7 is positively associated with tnf- and nf-b .
the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of adamts-7 in articular cartilage of onfh patients , to elucidate whether the expression was altered with cartilage degradation and radiological change , and to investigate the potential mechanisms involved , which may indicate new clinic therapeutic interventions for onfh .
involved in the increased expression of adamts-7 in cartilage of onfh patients , we stained phospho - nf-b p65 in the cartilage of both onfh and fnf patients .
furthermore , we also found a statistically significant increase in the expression of adamts-7 and tnf- in group iii compared to in group ii ( figure 2 ) .
groups ii and iii exhibit moderate - marked irregularity and more chondrocyte clusters and necrosis ; the safranin - o staining of group ii showed moderate - marked reduction while group iii was almost not stained ; their tidemark integrity was destroyed ( figure 1 ) .
mrna is expressed in both degraded cartilage from onfh patients and relatively normal cartilage from fnf patients . when we compared the expression levels of the target gene , a statistically significant increase in the gene expression of adamts-7
