it can be concluded the early detection of patients at younger age and in primary stages and histological grade may have positive effect on patients with esophageal cancer and be important to increase the survival time .
the present study showed that age of diagnosis , histological grade , and location of tumor was prognostic factors for survival in patients with esophageal cancer .
overall five - year survival in the cases of esophageal cancer in the present study was 49.0% , with survival rates being higher in the group of women compared to the men ( 19.7% versus 13.8% ) ( p = 0.48 ) , higher in clinical localized stages ( 41.2% ) compared to regional stages ( 14.3% ) ( p = < 0.001 ) , one survival rate higher in cases submitted to curative surgery ( 53.2% ) compared to those submitted to chemotherapy care ( 13.5 ) , ( p = <
therefore , the present study aimed to investigate the effects of histological factors on the survival of patients with esophageal cancer .
multivariate cox regression analyses ; f : cox regression analysis for age , gender , setting , stage at diagnosis and practice treatment ; e : cox - regression analysis for age , gender , setting , histology grade and location of tumor stage of tumor and practice treatment in step 2 of cox - regression analysis flowing demographic characteristic in step 1 using treatment surgery as reference revealed that patients who only had chemotherapy in process of treatment ( hr = 2.79 , 95% ci = 1.35 - 5.73 , p = 0.005 ) , and patients who only had radiotherapy ( hr = 7.27 , 95% ci = 1.53 - 34.39 , p = 0.012 ) had an increased risk of deaths from esophageal cancer .
