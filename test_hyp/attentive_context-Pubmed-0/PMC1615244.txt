second , dipping provides a massive spore concentration to the insect and results in faster mortality than spraying .
notice how as one scans from left to right , some strains result in high mortality shortly after exposure , in contrast to others that take a long time to cause high mortality .
the repetition of the germination at 24 h showed a similar tendency as the first germination test with some exceptions ( table 1 ) . in the first 24 h germination test
parameters used for scoring of 50 beauveria bassiana fungal isolates : % insect mortality , % spore germination , average survival time ( days ) , mortality distribution ( days ) , b. bassiana life cycle ( days ) , and spore production ( spores per insect ) .
butt and goettel ( 2000 ) reviewed the bioassays used for entomopathogenic fungi and outlined the different procedures to conduct the bioassays , which will depend upon the type of insect and fungi . in these bioassays , percent mortality and average survival time and , in a few cases
the same medium was used and the source of cultures was the same ( single spores maintained at 80c . ) spore suspensions of 110 spores ml caused high coffee berry borer mortality with 47 of the isolates reaching 100% mortality , two isolates causing 97.5% mortality and one causing 67.5% mortality ( table 1 ) .
