the goal of this study was firstly to assess the validity of rhpth treatment in a cohort of postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis ; secondly , to evaluate the improvement in qol and pain symptoms after several months of rhpth therapy .
a follow - up qualeffo-41 questionnaire was used to quantify the patient s pain and the affect on qol after rhpth therapy .
therefore , this study evidences that this anabolic agent represents a valid therapeutic option in severe postmenopausal osteoporosis ; moreover , patients after this treatment experience , improvements not only in pain relief , but also in certain aspects of emotional functioning , activities of daily living , and leisure activities , improve qol considerably .
the most widely used are the osteoporosis quality of life questionnaire ( oqlq ) , the osteoporosis assessment questionnaire ( opaq ) , the osteoporosis - targeted quality of life questionnaire ( optqol ) , and the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis ( qualeffo-41 ) .
our results demonstrate that rhpth increases bone mineral density considerably , reduces the occurrence of new fractures , and the need for analgesic therapy .
the aim of this study was to evaluate percentage changes from baseline in biochemical markers of bone turnover , values of bone mineral density ( measured at lumbar spine and proximal femur ) , and measurements of qol .
