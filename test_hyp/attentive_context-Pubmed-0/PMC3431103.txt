in the present study , we demonstrated a murine model of ali that administration of pgrn effectively prevented the development of lps - induced ali , at least in part , through their interaction with tnfr2 .
our findings strongly demonstrated that pgrn could effectively ameliorate the lps - induced acute lung injury in mice , suggesting a potential role for pgrn - based therapy to treat clinical ards .
we found that administration of pgrn significantly reduced lps - induced pulmonary inflammation and resulted in remarkable reversal of lps - induced increases in lung permeability , accompanied by a significant reduction of histopathology changes of lung .
here we evaluated the expression of pgrn protein in bal fluid of lps - induced ali mice .
thus , we hypothesized that pgrn might exert as a promising molecule for treatment of inflammation in ali .   to address this issue , here we carefully evaluate the potential role of pgrn in treatment of ali using the murine model of lps - induced ali .
we found that administration of pgrn effectively maintained the body weight and survival of lps - induced ali mice .
furthermore , pgrn administration significantly reduced lps - induced pulmonary inflammation and resulted in remarkable reversal of lps - induced increases in lung permeability . moreover ,
