a 3.09 kg , 33-day - old boy with pierre robin syndrome was admitted to our hospital for a glossopexy .
second , it is much safer to attempt repeated intubation in the case of accidental tube displacement out of the trachea during removal of the lma .
patients with pierre robin syndrome may create difficulties during intubation and airway control is a major concern for anesthesiologists .
ventilation using a face - mask in the presence of a markedly recessed mandible may be difficult and patient 's supine position frequently leads to a total obstruction of the airway .
however , in pediatric difficult airway cases in which the endotracheal tube length is similar to or shorter than the lma , the proximal end of the tracheal tube tends to disappear into the lma once the tracheal tube has passed through the vocal cords . in this situation
first , it can provide a more stable passage for the endotracheal tube since the diameter of the caec which we used ( 1.6 mm i d ) is larger than the guide wire previously used to pass through the suction port .
osses et al .   introduced a method of using an adult intubating stylet attached to the end of the tracheal tube so that lma would be removed while pushing the stylet inward . as an alternative approach , we used the caec under the guidance of the fiberscope to ease the insertion of the endotracheal tube into the trachea . however , when this catheter was passed down through the lma , it frequently emerged from the posterior aspect of the mask aperture of the lma and resulted in an esophageal intubation even though vocal cords were well - visualized with the ultrathin fob . despite many trials using a caec , it was very difficult to approach the vocal cords with the tip of the catheter .
