this type of analysis should be used to investigate the unexplored correlations of the 
 various clinical properties of the geometrical characteristics of the endodontic files , 
 opening new avenues for research in the field of endodontics .
for the 
 first time , we have shown that mxct is capable of discriminating the quantitative 
 differences in the geometrical properties of the successive sizes of endodontic files . 

the surface area and volume demonstrated an almost linear increase , while the specific 
 surface area demonstrated an abrupt decrease towards the higher file sizes .
the raw 
 data , the fitted line , the 95% confidence intervals , the yielded analytical formula , and 
 the regression coefficient ( r ) are all presented in figures 3a and 3b for the 
 surface area and volume , respectively .  
the aim of this study was to determine , for the first time , the surface area , volume and 
 specific surface area of successive file sizes of a commercially available ni - ti system . 
 additionally , we tested the hypothesis that mxct is capable of discriminating the 
 quantitative differences in the aforementioned geometrical properties between the 
 successive sizes of endodontic files .
the 
 hypothesis tested was that there are significant differences in the surface area , volume 
 and specific surface area among the different sizes of endodontic files .
