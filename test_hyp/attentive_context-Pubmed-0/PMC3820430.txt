furthermore , mscs are useful in suppressing corneal transplantation rejection and facilitating corneal wound healing . 
mscs have potential therapeutic value in corneal reconstruction since they have anti - inflammatory and modulatory effects on corneal angiogenesis based on results obtained with several animal models .
additional animal model research is needed to address questions regarding how to transdifferentiate mscs into corneal epithelial cells , the most appropriate route and time for applying mscs for different kinds of corneal reconstruction , the specific mechanisms , and so on . before mscs can be tested in a clinical setting
corneal reconstruction is a series of techniques for restoring the integrity and transparency of the cornea , and mainly refers to surgical techniques such as cornea transplantation , limbal stem cell ( lsc ) transplantation and amnion transplantation , and autologous oral mucosal epithelial transplantation .
related studies on the roles of mscs in the cornea are reviewed here to summarize the possible mechanisms and shed additional light .
the regenerative / reparative potential and the immune - suppressive capacity of mscs are the current areas of research focus .
many clinical studies on mscs led to positive results , which focused on the effects of mscs on regenerative medicine , preventing graft rejection   and controlling graft versus host disease ( gvhd ) .
