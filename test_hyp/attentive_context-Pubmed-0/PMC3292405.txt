a total of 106 patients of reproductive age ( range = 1847 years ) received a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy that was carried out using a 4 mm karman curette attached to a 10 ml syringe to produce a vacuum , which is the standard procedure for the evaluation of menorrhagia , severe dysmenorrhea , or infertility in the day hospital where the current study was carried out .
, aromatase expression was determined in the eutopic endometrium of patients with severe menstrual symptoms and/or infertility who underwent laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as a part of their diagnostic work - up .
estrogens produced locally in the endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium result in the mechanism of decreased immune surveillance and enhanced tolerance found in endometriosis,14 which may explain the inverse relationship between estrogen levels and impaired nk - cell function found as a function of the severity of the disease .
15 local estrogen production would also stimulate the production of vegf , growth factors , and inflammatory cytokines by immune cells , thus favoring the progression of endometriosis.12,15,16 the blockade of phagocytosis by the local production of estrogens and the concomitant stimulation of growth and inflammatory factors would explain the paradoxical effects of macrophages in endometriosis , which seem to interact with rather than destroy these ectopic endometrial cells , thus enhancing their growth and angiogenesis.12,17 in conclusion , a vicious cycle of enhanced inflammation and local estrogen production mediated by cox-2 and aromatase expression in the eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients may play a pivotal role not only in determining the clinical course of this disease but also in defining the intensity of its debilitating symptoms . in the pelvic cavity ,
