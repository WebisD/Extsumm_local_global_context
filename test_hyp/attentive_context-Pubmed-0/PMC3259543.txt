we presented a case of a pe in a patient with symptoms including severe chest pain with exertion that was diagnosed with the expertise of echocardiography and subsequently surgically corrected .
pectus excavatum ( pe ) , characterized by posterior displacement of the sternum and cartilaginous - rib attachments , is one of the most common congenital chest wall deformities.1)2 ) the physiological impact of pe varies .
the degree of right heart compression however is often difficult to assess by transthoracic echo ( tte ) especially with severe deformities that prevent the operator from obtaining the normal transthoracic views.7 - 9 )
a 32-year - old woman presented to out - patient clinic for further evaluation of a 1-year history of progressive chest pain , fatigue , dizziness , paroxysmal tachycardia and dyspnea with exertion . with even mild exertional effort she experienced sharp , " stabbing " chest pain along the left lower and mid - sternum .
subtle abnormalities in cardiac structure and chest wall compression may result in debilitating symptoms in a small population of patients.2 - 4 ) when astutely performed , echocardiography can accurately provide clinically relevant information about cardiac size and any hemodynamic compromise in patients with pe .
