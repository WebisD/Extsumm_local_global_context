although diffuse swelling of the pancreatic parenchyma can be morphologically characteristic of aip , a focal type of this clinical entity has been recently recognized and is still difficult to establish . however , in this day and age , even with heightened awareness of aip and appropriate preoperative workup ( including serum immunoglobulin g fraction 4 ( igg4 ) measurement and , in very select cases , a short steroid trial ) , some patients with aip are likely to be resected for the suspicion of malignancy .
the preoperative diagnosis should prevent unnecessary surgery causing a high morbidity comparing to medical treatment ( corticosteroid ) of aip .
a 56-year - old patient was referred to our unit for upper abdominal pain since two week and lost of 6 kg in two months . in his past medical history
three series have reported the prevalence of autoimmune pancreatitis as between 5% and 6% of all patients with chronic pancreatitis .

35% of patients undergoing pancreatic resection for presumed pc in fact has aip , as was the case of our patient .
