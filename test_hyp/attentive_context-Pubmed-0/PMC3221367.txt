studies in malaria - infected humans and in mouse models provide strong evidence that plasmodium parasites modulate dc maturation and function and induce the expansion of cd4foxp3 regulatory t cells . in turn
indeed , it has been observed that populations of tolerogenic human and murine dc induce or promote cd4foxp3 regulatory t cells via tgf-- and il-2-dependent mechanisms 63 - 66 . increased knowledge concerning dc and cd4foxp3 regulatory t cells may provide strategies for devising novel immunotherapeutic approaches for manipulating the immune response to malaria and tilting the balance between protective and immunopathogenic responses in favor of the host and prevention of severe disease .
here , we review recent findings from our laboratory and others in experimental models of malaria in mice and in plasmodium - infected humans on the activation and expansion of cd11c dc and foxp3 regulatory t cells and their possible roles in regulating adaptive immunity to blood - stage malaria .
more extensive studies are required to provide a clearer understanding of the role of dc that are deficient in producing the th1-promoting cytokine il-12 and result in a lethal infection .
, these regulatory t cells may modulate effector cd4 t cell responses to malaria infection suppressing protective immune responses but preventing immune - mediated pathology .
