this paper describes a case of parosteal osteosarcoma and emphasizes the need for differential diagnosis of this rare entity with benign reactive and neoplastic osseous lesions .
osteosarcoma is a malignancy of mesenchymal cells that have the ability to produce osteoid or immature bone .
however , we report parosteal osteosarcoma in a 22-year - old female patient , in the maxillary region .
a 22-year - old female patient presented with the complaint of swelling in the right side of the face since 9 months , which was not associated with pain , discharge or neurological symptoms .
, this case illustrates the importance of correlation of clinical , radiological and histopathological features in confirming the diagnosis of parosteal osteosarcoma . because of the less aggressive biological behavior
unni et al . , defined the juxtacortical osteosarcoma as  a distinctive type of malignant bone tumor that originates on external surface of the bone specifically in relation to periosteum and/or immediate connective tissue .
parosteal osteosarcoma of craniofacial area behave similar to long bone counterparts with slow growth and low grade malignancy that do not tend to metastasize .
surface tumors are further divided into parosteal well - differentiated ( low - grade ) , periosteallow- to intermediate - grade and high - grade surface osteosarcomas . in 1949 , geschickter and copeland were the first to describe parosteal osteosarcomas under the heading of  parosteal osteoma  a group of parosteal bone tumors of which the seemingly benign clinical and histologic aspect was belied by frequent relapse and metastasis .
