this is the first case report in the english literature of angiofibroma originating in the inferior turbinate in a young woman .
the surgical approach is tailored to the location and size of tumor.1 in our case , the tumor was small enough for total excision with an endonasal endoscopic approach .
we should consider these neoplasms possibly in female patients , at every age , with extranasopharyngeal localization , and we should not perform biopsy because of massive bleeding .
there are reports in the english literature of inferior turbinate angiofibroma in male patients.3

 6 in female patients , there is only one case report in the english literature of inferior turbinate angiofibroma in a 52-year - old woman.7 recently , a report was published of a 9-year - old girl with angiofibroma obstructing the nasal cavity and originating from the inferior turbinate.8 
  differential diagnosis includes fibrosed antrochoanal and ethmoidal polyp and other fibrovascular tumors , such as capillary hemangioma , hemangiopericytoma , and solitary fibrous tumor.3 

the lesion is diagnosed earlier , is less vascularized , and occurs in older patients.2 similar to jnas , the treatment of choice for enas is surgery .
the abundant vascular component is responsible for the excessive bleeding during surgery or following biopsies.1 
  extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas ( enas ) have been reported sporadically in the literature .
