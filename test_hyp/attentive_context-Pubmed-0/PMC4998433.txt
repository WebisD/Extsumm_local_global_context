both non - hdl cholesterol ( hr per 1-sd increment [ 95% ci ] ; 1.13   , p = 0.002 ) and estimated apob ( hr per 1-sd increment [ 95% ci ] ; 1.14   , p = 0.001 ) were associated with the development of cvd independent of the aforementioned risk factors .
including 233,455 subjects and 22,950 events , apob was the most potent marker of cardiovascular risk ( relative risk ratio , 1.43 ; 95% ci , 1.351.51 ) , ldl cholesterol was the least potent ( relative risk ratio , 1.25 ; 95% ci , 1.181.33 ) , and non - hdl cholesterol was intermediate ( relative risk ratio , 1.34 ; 95% ci , 1.241.44 ) .
in the current prospective , community - based , cohort study performed in 8713 subjects from a general korean population , our newly developed equation to estimate apob , which was calculated from total cholesterol , triglyceride , and hdl cholesterol levels , was predictive of future cvd independent of other well - established risk factors including age , sex , waist circumference , current smoking , and presence of diabetes and hypertension during 8.1 years of follow - up .
