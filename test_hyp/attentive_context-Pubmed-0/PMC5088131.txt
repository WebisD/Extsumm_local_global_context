therefore , this study was designed to examine ( i ) 
 whether there are differences between young and older adults in cognitive performance and 
 postural control after stepping back , and ( ii ) to what extent dual - tasking affects cognitive 
 performance and postural control .
in conclusion , young adults had better postural control and superior cognitive performance 
 in both single- and dual - tasking as they showed significantly shorter reaction times and 
 lower error rates in the auditory stroop test , as well as shorter total sway paths and 
 smaller total sway areas in the postural task .
although neither group showed a significant 
 difference in postural control between single- and dual - tasking , they had significantly 
 longer reaction times during dual - tasking , indicating older adults tend to prioritize 
 postural control over cognitive performance when dual - tasking .
this study investigated the postural control and cognitive performance of older adults in 
 both single- and dual - tasking .
a significant overall ( group  task ) difference ( f=24.835 ; p<0.001 ) in the auditory 
 stroop test was found by repeated measures manova .
each participant performed three tasks : an auditory stroop test and a stepping - backward 
 task with and without a concurrent auditory stroop test .
