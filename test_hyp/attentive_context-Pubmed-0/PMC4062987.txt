however myocardial infarction , tako - tsubo - like syndrome and cardiogenic shock are also described .
5-fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug and cardiac complications are not rare .
this report describes a patient with no history of cardiovascular disease who experienced acute left - ventricular failure after administration of 5-fu .
ecmo support enabled complete relief of cardiac workload and together with medical therapy for heart failure , complete recovery of cardiac function was possible .
this is the first report of an ecmo support in this kind of chemotherapeutic induced cardiogenic shock .
a 50-year - old man ( weight 70 kg , height 180 cm ) was admitted to a primary care hospital following an episode of syncope . he reported acute orthopnea and an attack of sweating at night accompanied by nausea and vomiting before loss of consciousness for 1 min .
patient was discharged from hospital in a stable cardiac condition without symptoms of heart failure 11 days after admission .

recently , intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was shown not to reduce 30-day mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction . in our case with progressive cardiogenic shock ,
