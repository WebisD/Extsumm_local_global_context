all outcomes of rsa implanted for all types of indications significantly improved in the postoperative period , but those corresponding to revision of anatomic prosthesis , failed rotator cuff repair , and fracture sequelae demonstrated lower improvements compared with cuff tear arthropaty .
the purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and functional outcomes of rsa depending on the surgical approach , type of prosthesis , and indication for surgery through a comprehensive , systematic review of the literature .
the purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and functional outcomes of rsa depending on the type of prosthesis ( with either medialized or lateralized center of rotation ) , type of approach , and indication for surgery .
literature search flow chart the 35 included studies were grouped depending on the approach and type of prosthesis : deltopectoral approach associated with prosthesis with a medialized center of rotation ( dm group ; n = 18 studies ) , lateralized ( dl group ; n = 8 studies ) , and a combination of approaches associated with a medialized prosthesis ( cm group ; n = 9 studies ) .
the rsa is a surgical procedure with high patient satisfaction regardless of the type of prosthesis or the indication for surgery .
