the statistical comparison is expressed as significant ( p < 0.05 ) and highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) with regard to polypharmacy and pim . 

the objective of this study was to evaluate the association of pim use with hospital readmission within 30 days regardless of the admitting diagnosis .
mansur and colleagues evaluated several objectives in a cohort of hospitalized elderly patients , including the relationship of pims with readmission and mortality , 3 months post discharge .
this nested case - control study included all patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge to a 250 bed community hospital located in scranton , pennsylvania usa . all patients 65 years of age or older admitted between january 2008 and december 2009 were eligible for study enrollment .
no polypharmacy and no inappropriate drugs were statistically significant as compared to polypharmacy and pim . at day 1 and day 0 , data for all the readmissions was compiled and statistical analysis was carried out .
the impact of polypharmacy and pim combined on hospital readmission was statistically significant only when the readmission occurred on the same day or immediate next day .
this is important because india is seeing rapid surge of elderly with infrastructure and health care system ill equipped to handle it .
