we aimed to identify baseline factors that would help predict subsequent cug and therefore help counsel the families , the degree of cug , the usefulness of obtaining igf - i and igfbp-3 levels , and the impact of nutrition on cug and the physiologic roles of nutrition and the growth hormone system on cug .
the goal of this prospective longitudinal study was to examine the determinants of cug in 148 postinstitutionalized international adoptees during the first 6 months after arrival into their adoptive families .
6.8% of children remained stunted ( < 2 ht sds ) at the end of the study , and two of these children were identified as having growth hormone deficiency .   older children with more severe baseline growth failure were more likely to remain stunted at follow - up .
cug , defined as a gain of > + 0.5 in height sds , was observed in 62% of children ( 82 out of 132 ) , and 23% ( 30 out of 132 ) gained > + 1 height sds over the six month period .  
young age , severity of short stature , and higher dietary intake at the initial visit were statistically significant independent predictors of improved growth ( delta ht sds ) ( table 2 ) .
