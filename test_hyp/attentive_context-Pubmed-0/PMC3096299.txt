the animals were randomized by weight into four experimental groups ( n = 10 in each group ) : ovx soy - free group ( ovx ) , pth group receiving 5x / w ) , pth group receiving subcutaneous injections of 0.040  mg / kg parathyroid hormone ( 1 - 34 ) every 2 days ( pth e2d ) , and a sham group .
the present study showed that treatment with pth 5x / w and pth 2ed both improved the biomechanical and histomorphometric properties and partially reversed the effects of ovx in the trochanteric region of the rat femur . under conditions presented in our study , the anabolic effect of pth
there are many similarities between the human and rat femur , both at the microstructural and macrostructural levels   . in the present study , we investigated the region - specific influence of two different application frequencies of pth on femoral trochanteric strength of ovariectomized rats .
5x / w seems to be slightly stronger than pth e2d therapy , but the main significant changes were observed concerning elasticity and tb.wi .
the trochanteric region of the rat femur is an important skeletal site for osteoporosis studies because of its high clinical relevance .
