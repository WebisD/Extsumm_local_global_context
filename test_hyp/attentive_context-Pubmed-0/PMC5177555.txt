 7 we report the case of a neonate affected by prenatally diagnosed cdh treated by thoracoscopy . during the procedure
the case report describes the usefulness of thoracoscopy as diagnostic and therapeutic tool in case of diaphragmatic hernia associated with undiagnosed lung malformation .
thoracoscopy allows to explore thoracic cavity looking for lung lesions that are associated to diaphragmatic hernia in 1540% of cases and to remove them .
a female infant was delivered by elective cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation and was referred to our department for prenatal diagnosis of left diaphragmatic hernia detected at 32 weeks of gestation by ultrasounds and characterized by a lung - to - head ratio ( lhr ) of 1.6 .
once entered in the pleural cavity , we noted a diaphragmatic hernia with a sac .
