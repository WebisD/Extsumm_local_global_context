a nonstatistically significant trend toward increased cancer detection was found , when an anesthesia provider was present .
anesthesia providers were present 25.48% of the time , which is consistent with previously published us and canadian rates of 27.8% and 19.1% , respectively.6,17 our study demonstrates that , in a population of predominantly average - risk patients , the presence of an anesthesia provider during a colonoscopy has no impact on the incidence of mi or stroke . however , a statistically significant decrease in the rate of repeated colonoscopies ( 0.7% ) was associated with the presence of an anesthesia provider . although further study with sufficient power is needed to confirm the finding of a nonsignificant trend toward increased cancer detection , the decrease in repeat colonoscopies may be consistent with the nonsignificant trend toward greater cancer detection when an anesthesia provider is present .
in addition , adherence to the 2004 joint national guidelines published by the american college of gastroenterology ( acg ) , american gastroenterological association ( aga ) , and american society of gastrointestinal endoscopy ( asge ) on the use of anesthesia providers during screening colonoscopies is studied .
a nonsignificant trend toward a greater likelihood of a cancer diagnosis was present if an anesthesia provider was involved ( 2.03% vs 1.7% , p=0.13 ) ( tables 3 and 4 )
