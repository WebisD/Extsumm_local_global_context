to increase awareness of the limitations of high - risk human papillomavirus ( hrhpv ) laboratory - developed testing ( ldt ) widely used in us cervical cancer screening .
a review of the available data indicates that ( 1 ) purification of dna from surepath specimens requires complex sample preparation due to formaldehyde crosslinking of proteins and nucleic acids , ( 2 ) hc2surepath hrhpv testing had not been food and drug administration - approved after multiple premarket approval submissions , ( 3 ) detectible hrhpv dna in the surepath vial decreases over time , and ( 4 ) us laboratories performing hc2surepath hrhpv ldt testing are not using a standardized manufacturer - endorsed procedure .
a young woman in her 30s was diagnosed and treated for stage 1b1 cervical squamous cell carcinoma in which hpv 16 dna was detected using polymerase chain reaction testing . both 1 month before and 42 months before cervical cancer diagnosis , the patient had highly abnormal cytology findings ; however , residual surepath ( becton , dickson and company , franklin lakes , nj ) vial fluid yielded negative hybrid capture 2 ( hc2 ; qiagen nv , hilden , germany ) hrhpv ldt results from each of the two specimens .
