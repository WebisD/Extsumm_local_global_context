our findings emphasize a need of booster - programs targeted to 11 - 12-year - olds and especially boys .
significantly bigger proportion of children in the upper grades ( 55.3% ) reported using xylitol chewing gum two times a day or more often compared to children in the lower grades ( 43.0% ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
tooth brushing and flossing frequency as well as use of fluoride tablets increased significantly among the schoolchildren during the study period 2009 and 2010 ( p < 0.05 ) .
it is also noteworthy that intervention may be more effective on younger children ( 710-year - olds ) compared to older children ; maybe because of the activity of the parents , which should not be neglected as a resource in oral health promotion .
in conclusion , this study gives interesting information about oral health habits of 713-year - olds , when most of the previous studies in finland and elsewhere have been conducted among older children .
children in lower grades got significantly more often daily parental help in tooth brushing in 2009 ( 21.4% ) , and parents reminded them of tooth brushing in 2010 ( 76.4% ) significantly more often than older children ( 2.6% and 57.2% , ( p < 0.001 ) ) .
