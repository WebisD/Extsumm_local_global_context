the purpose of this study was to determine whether postmenopausal current ht users had significantly different iad than those who were former users of ht in the women on the move through activity and nutrition ( woman ) randomized trial .
. it also demonstrates the importance of measuring iad and ld in postmenopausal women with differing ht use .
ld was also significantly larger in the former ht users than in the current ht users ( 5.44  mm versus 5.31  mm , p = 0.002 , table 2 )
simple linear regression showed that in addition to former ht use , larger iad was significantly associated with greater systolic blood pressure , pulse pressure , bmi , weight , height , waist circumference ( all p < 0.0001 ) , glucose , insulin ( both p = 0.001 ) , age , caucasian race , current nonsmoking status and use of antihypertensive medications ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 3 ) .
former ht use , greater bmi , weight , height , waist circumference , insulin ( all p < 0.01 ) , glucose , and pulse pressure ( both p < 0.05 ) were associated with larger ld in univariate linear regression ( table 3 ) . the variables that yielded the best multivariate model to explain larger ld were former ht use , higher pulse pressure , and higher weight .
