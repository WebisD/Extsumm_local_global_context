however , the vat - ec phenotype in obese subjects was markedly proangiogenic and inflammatory , with decreased expression of metabolism - related genes , including el , gpihbp1 , and ppar. this phenotype of vat - ec in obese subjects could be related to premature ec senescence , as suggested by expression of the senescence markers , igfbp3 and -h2ax , as well as decreased expression of sirt1 .
together our results show that although the capillary density of vat is higher than that of sat , vat - ec exhibit a phenotype characterized by marked activation of inflammatory and angiogenic pathways associated with altered metabolic function in obese subjects .
expression of inflammatory , angiogenic , and metabolic genes in human sat and vat ec .
increased expression of the hypoxia - related genes , hif-1 , vegfa , and glut1 was found in vat compared with sat adipocytes . despite previous studies reporting that leptin and fiaf are induced under hypoxic conditions ( 20,21 ) , we found they were lower in vat than sat .
expression of vegfa and glut1 was tightly linked with that of hif-1. moreover , sat adipocytes maintained under low oxygen conditions had higher vegfa and glut1 expresssion than vat , whereas the expression of both leptin and fiaf was not affected substantially .
