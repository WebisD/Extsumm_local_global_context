the main drawback of sils is the loss of triangulation of surgical instruments in the operative field , which despite recent development of curved instruments and flexible endoscopes enhances technical difficulty and requires a long learning curve .
laparoscopic surgery ( ls ) for both benign and neoplastic colonic disease has become a standard procedure worldwide   , although its distribution is currently limited .
needlescopic technique keeps port positioning unchanged compared to standard laparoscopic procedures and therefore has minimal impact on the surgeon .
these findings should promote a larger prospective randomized comparison with conventional laparoscopy to determine whether this refinement of laparoscopic colorectal surgery confers concrete and incontrovertible benefits to the patients .
in our practice , laparoscopic colorectal resections are currently performed with a 3- to 5-port ( 512  mm size ) technique , intracorporeal anastomosis whenever possible , and specimen extraction through a suprapubic transverse incision .
since reports are limited in this field , we aim to review technical points such as instrumentation and its use in the different steps of the operation .
many authors reported adequacy and short - term benefits also for laparoscopic rectal procedures   ; nevertheless , large randomized studies and oncologic results are still lacking . in recent years , innovative endoscopic procedures such as single - port laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) ,
