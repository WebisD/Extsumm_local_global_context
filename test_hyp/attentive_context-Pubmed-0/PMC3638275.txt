the authors report a very rare case of spinal cord and brain metastasis of mpnst in the lumbar spine that occurred in a 18-year - old man without nf .
we reported a case of mpnst that had metastasized to the brain and spinal cord .
a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( mpnst ) is a sarcoma that arises from peripheral nerves or cells of the associated nerve sheath ( schwann cells , perineural cells , fibroblasts ) .
non - nf-1 mpnsts are very rare and the occurrence of mpnsts occurring in adolescents is very rare
an 18-year - old man presented initially with a 6-month history of low back pain that worsened over time .
because the mpnst showed both rapid and aggressive progression , patients should be followed carefully to identify local recurrence or metastasis and be mandatory an adjuvant radiotherapy .
mpnsts are most likely to metastasize to the lungs , followed by the bone and finally the pleura , but , spinal cord and brain metastasis is very rare in non - nf-1 mpnst3,7 ) .
however , more than half of mpnst cases develop in patients with neurofibromatosis type-1 ( nf-1 ) and there is a higher incidence in patients that have undergone prior radiotherapy1,2,5,8,13 ) .
