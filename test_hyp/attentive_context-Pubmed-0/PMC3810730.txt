phylogenetic trees of mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients with primary tuberculosis , yakutia and irkutsk , russian federation .
this work characterizes severe isoniazid monoresistant and mdr tb in eastern siberia among patients with no history of tb treatment .
from november 2008 through may 2010 , m. tuberculosis isolates were cultured during routine care of adults > 18 years of age with primary tb and no history of treatment .
although rpob mutations were found in only 79% of rifampin - resistant isolates , these findings are consistent with those in a recent report from novosibirsk oblast , which similarly included non - beijing and s - family strains and found a sensitivity of only 63% for the rpob mutation ( 12 ) .
, isolates of the s 256 strain accounted for a proportion of the cases in which mutation in the promoter region of eis was associated with kanamycin resistance , but rrs was wild type .
s 256 was highly drug resistant and was the most common genotype among patients with primary mdr tb .
notably , both isolates with mutation in eis from yakutia occurred in mdr strains with the s 256 genotype and without rrs mutation . *
