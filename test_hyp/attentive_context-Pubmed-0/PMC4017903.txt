this is due to the rarity of the disease in most countries where rcts have been performed and difficulty in recruiting patients , resulting in underpowered studies . a recent cochrane review comparing treatments for pemphigus found significant heterogeneity amongst the rcts with respect to the study designs , primary outcome measures , and therapeutic end - points
. such variation prevented the authors from performing direct comparisons and a meaningful meta - analysis . to solve this problem of variation between studies , a panel of international bullous experts convened on many occasions to form a consensus paper on the definitions of disease and therapeutic end - points for pemphigus .
complications , a lot of the recent research in pemphigus has been directed at finding the optimal steroid - sparing agent .
the goal of this consensus paper was to facilitate researchers and clinicians to design studies with similar study end - points so that even if an rct was underpowered , its data could be used in conjunction with other similar studies in a meta - analysis .
though many treatments have been tried in the management of pemphigus , often demonstrating clinical benefit in individual case reports and case series , the evidence supporting their use has not been confirmed in rcts .
