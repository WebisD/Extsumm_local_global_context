the mean recovery time for conventional technique was 9.61 days ( standard deviations [ sd ] 1.68 ) , whereas with lc and clot culture techniques it was 4.08 ( sd  0.87 ; p < 0.0001 ) and 5.83 ( sd  1.37 ; p < 0.0001 ) respectively . in the acute stage ,
, an attempt has been made to compare lc , clot culture and conventional culture techniques for the isolation of brucella from blood specimen in an endemic area .
we propose that for the isolation of brucella from blood specimen , lc method is better than conventional castaneda 's method as the isolation rate is high and the recovery time is less .
patients were divided into three groups as : acute ( < 8 weeks ) , sub - acute ( 8 - 52 weeks ) and chronic ( > 52 weeks ) brucellosis .
culture positivity by various culture techniques in different stages of brucellosis when compared with the conventional technique lc and clot culture techniques yielded growth in significantly more number of cases ( p < 0.0001 ) .
in the present study , blood culture positivity was found to be 24.8% , 43.1% and 34.9% and the recovery time was 10 , 4 and 6 days by conventional , lc and clot culture techniques respectively .
