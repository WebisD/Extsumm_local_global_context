discoveries of restriction enzymes by hamilton smith and daniel nathans , and reverse transcriptase by howard temin   and david baltimore   in the 1970s set the stage for an explosion in molecular and clinical genetics .
thus , gene therapy of hematopoietic diseases with retroviruses lumbers in choppy straits twixt the scylla of insufficient gene transfer and the charybdis of leukemia , while the therapy of metabolic and coagulation disorders with adeno- and adeno - associated viruses is blunted by immune reponses to the vectors . to committed gene therapists ,
armed with a sufficient amount of the mrna product of a gene such as the beta globin gene , investigators could now produce a radioactive dna copy ( cdna ) of the mrna and use it as a valuable probe of gene expression .
the future could lie in the promising field of site - specific gene correction using modified nucleases , and the conversion of corrected somatic cells such as fibroblasts to functioning hematopoietic stem cells .
while eager clinical investigators hoped to apply the new genetics in the treatment of inherited diseases , cooler heads recognized that the technology was not sufficiently powerful or predictable .
his reward was failure and opprobrium , and academic medicine encountered a congress increasingly determined to surround clinical research with an ever - growing net of regulation .
