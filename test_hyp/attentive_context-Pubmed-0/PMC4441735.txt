with further research , refinement and contributions made by survivors , health researchers and health care professionals , the survivorship care plan is proposed to be a useful and practical tool aimed at supporting the survivorship continuum of care .
this review also targeted the use of scps from the perspective of survivors and therefore the experiences of other key stakeholders ( treating medical professionals and providers of support services ) are not articulated .
the aim of this systematic review is to document and review the available published qualitative literature that describes cancer survivors experiences of using survivorship care plans .
this systematic review examined the experiences of cancer survivors using survivorship care plans and explored many of the current issues relating to their use across a range of different contexts .
while the period of cancer survivorship is gaining interest amongst clinicians and researchers , it is clear that further studies are needed to explore the range of scps available , the practicalities related to their use and how to best ensure they meet the needs of cancer survivors in the future .
permutations of the following search terms were truncated and exploded : cancer , neoplasm or malignancy survivor , experiences , opinions , ideas , views or preferences , survivorship care plan , post - treatment care , forward care , survivorship program , individualised care plan and comprehensive care plan .
