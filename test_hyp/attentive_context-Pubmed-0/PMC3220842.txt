in this study , we demonstrate that women who deliver an lga infant in the absence of gdm do not exhibit the postpartum metabolic dysfunction that is characteristic of women with gdm . specifically , compared with women with
lga group had lower levels of glycemia ( fasting glucose and aucgluc ) , higher whole - body insulin sensitivity , and better -cell function at 3 months postpartum , after adjustment for covariates .
previous studies show that even in the absence of established gdm in their mothers , macrosomic infants display elevated cord insulin and c - peptide levels ( 16,17 ) .
thus , an lga delivery in the absence of gdm is not necessarily indicative of undiagnosed gestational glucose intolerance but , rather , may be due to the influence of other factors , such as obesity .
these data suggest that the long - standing clinical assumption that delivery of an lga infant reflects undiagnosed maternal hyperglycemia may no longer be appropriate in modern practice .
gdm independently predicted postpartum glucose intolerance ( odds ratio 4.1 [ 95% ci 2.56.8 ] ; p < 0.0001 ) , after adjustment for age , months postpartum , ethnicity , family history of diabetes , breastfeeding , and waist circumference .
