we have shown that arterial stiffness is increased in diabetic patients without overt cardiovascular disease , but we did not find an association between el and pwv in our diabetic patients . in conclusion , in patients with type 2 diabetes , serum el concentration was increased , but impaired serum capacity to induce cholesterol efflux in these patients was mainly related to low hdl and subclinical inflammation .
no association between serum el and pwv was observed in either the diabetic patients or controls . in the diabetic patients , pwv correlated with logcrp ( r  =  0.20 , p  <  0.05 ) and srbi mediated cholesterol efflux ( r  =  0.17 , p  <  0.05 ) in addition to its strong correlation with systolic bp ( r  =  0.54 , p  <  0.01 ) .
plasma hdl , serum el and waist circumference were the independent determinants of srbi mediated cholesterol efflux to serum in controls , accounting for 24% , 10% and 2% of the variability of cholesterol efflux respectively .
there was no significant correlation between serum el and hdl in controls ( r  =  0.08 ) or diabetic patients ( r  =  0.05 ) , whilst there was a weak trend between serum el and logcrp ( controls r  =  0.13 , p  =  0.08 ; diabetics r  =  0.14 , p  =  0.07 ) .
