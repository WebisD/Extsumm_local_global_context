critical care practice is beginning to look toward more specific cellular , biochemical , and genetic interventions in order to make a significant impact on patient outcomes .
in addition to the extensive cellular , biochemical , and genetic body of research in process today , the science of epigenetics has become a more frequent focus within the critical care literature over the past 5 + years .  
the state of the science in understanding the role of epigenetic regulation as it relates to the pathology of critical illness , clinical course , and outcomes is evolving rapidly yet still well within its infancy .
better identification and understanding of the role of epigenetic modifications that are associated with the complex regulatory and disregulatory processes of the disease state is essential and it is apparent that our approach to therapeutically target epigenetic modifications to improve outcomes may only be a single component of even more complex novel therapies to come .
research regarding the influence of genetics is in its early stages , and investigators are just beginning to look toward the science of epigenetics for explanations for patient and population differences in susceptibility to illness , clinical course , and outcomes . in the following sections ,
