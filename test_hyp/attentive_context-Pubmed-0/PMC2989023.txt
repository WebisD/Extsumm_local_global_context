the main objective of our study was to show the long - term effects of fusion on the adjacent joints using our technique .
if the arthrodesis is performed with an optimal alignment of the leg , complaints from the adjacent joints are minimal , even in the long term , and an acceptable quality of life can be obtained .
this descriptive study of our fusion techniques shows a good outcome measured by the smfa and a good vas for pain for all related joints after an average of 19  years of follow - up .
we found that the mobility and quality of life were good for patients with an arthrodesis .
although hip arthrodesis has lost it popularity it still is an option for young patient with severe hip disorders , while leaving the possibility to perform a tha at a later stage .
especially lower back pain seems to occur frequently after a hip fusion in the long term , since 42% of our patients had a vas for pain of 3 and higher for lower back pain .
the clinical investigation consisted of : range of motion of hips and knees , mobility of the back , laxity of the knee joint , leg length discrepancies and quadriceps strength .
