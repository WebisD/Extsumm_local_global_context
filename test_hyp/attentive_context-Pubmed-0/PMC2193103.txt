baff , a costimulator of b lymphocyte survival and proliferation , has two known receptors , b cell maturation antigen ( bcma ) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand ( caml ) interactor ( taci ) 4567 . in this study , we demonstrate that taci and bcma also bind to april and that inhibition of april with a soluble form of bcma interferes with tumor growth in vivo , suggesting an important role of april in carcinogenesis .
many of the ligands trigger costimulatory growth signals in primary cells , lead to the activation of nuclear factor ( nf)-b , or even induce cell death . a proliferation - inducing ligand ( april )
as bcma and taci mrna expression was reported exclusively in b cells or activated t cells 56 , the proliferative effect of april on the fibroblastic nih-3t3 cells was difficult to explain .
april is a close sequence homologue of b cell activation factor of the tnf family ( baff , also known as blys / ztnf4/tall-1 ) 34 .
these data suggest that although bcma and taci are both receptors for april and baff , some specificity of interaction may be imposed by the apparent preference of bcma for april and of taci for baff . we have previously shown that nih-3t3 cells stably transfected with full - length human april proliferate faster than mock - transfected cells in vitro and in vivo 1 . as membrane - bound april
