tissues neighboring large periodontal pockets present inflammatory markers such as il-17 , tnf- , mmp-2 , and osteoclasts accumulation , which could be predictors of local bone resorption and disease spreading .
, the present study focused on the detection of the ongoing inflammatory changes in the bone and neighboring tissues directly affected by the destructive disease in pd patients .
once bone resorption is a result of the balance between anti- and proinflammatory mediators that may activate tissue destructive enzymes , we assessed the expression of cytokines and metalloproteinases ( mmps ) in the bone tissue of pd and control samples .
importantly , this increase in the inflammatory cytokine tnf- was accompanied by augmented expression of mmp-2 mrna ( figure 3(b ) ) and there was a tendency towards elevated expression of mmp-1 and mmp-9 in pd patients ( figures 3(a ) and 3(d ) ) .
these results support the importance of a more detailed evaluation of these regions other than gingiva , since the local immune response may represent sentinel factors relevant for disease outcome .
the data presented in this study obtained from examination of sites close to areas with extensive periodontal damage showed that , as expected , inflammation in advanced pd is not restricted to gingiva . otherwise , tissues like alveolar bone that is clinically undergoing a resorption process present relevant findings that could be considered inflammatory biomarkers for disease development in susceptible patients .
