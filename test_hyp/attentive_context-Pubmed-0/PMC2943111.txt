the ner machinery would excise a large variety of lesions with different efficiencies , by recognizing the thermodynamic impact of the lesions rather than the lesions themselves   .    lesions that resist ner present a great hazard , as they survive to the replication step and produce a mutagenic outcome ; such ner - resistant lesions provide an important opportunity for gaining further understanding of the mechanism utilized by the ner apparatus to recognize different lesions .
figure 4 summarizes our key findings and enables us to infer a hierarchy of ner recognition signals for the series of sequences and the single lesion we explored .  
the eukaryotic ner pathway is a biologically complicated process and consists of two sub - pathways with different substrate specificity :   global genome ner ( gg - ner )   and transcription - coupled repair ( tcr )   .  
examples include impaired watson - crick pairing that is accompanied by diminished base stacking , and dna bending towards the major groove , that is induced by a minor groove lesion and is accompanied by minor groove enlargement .  
the vital importance of this mechanism is demonstrated by several human ner - deficiency syndromes including xeroderma pigmentosum ( xp ) , cockayne syndrome ( cs ) , and trichothiodystrophy ( ttd ) .
