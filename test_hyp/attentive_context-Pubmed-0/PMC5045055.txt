most solid cancers contain hypoxic areas , and clinical data demonstrate that overexpression of hif-1 is associated with an increased risk for patient mortality . in line ,
this review discusses the regulation of hif- by gsk-3 and compares it with hydroxylase - dependent hif- protein regulation .
activation of multiple oncogenic pathways including growth factor signaling coupled with enhanced kinase signaling is a common event in tumors , thus making it likely that kinases are involved in the modulation of hif- function .
the ability of mammals to respond to an inadequate o2 supply , commonly termed hypoxia , is crucial for their survival .
because regulation of hif- protein stability is critical for its activation , identification of kinases contributing to hif- stability may provide a link explaining normoxic hif- stabilization by extracellular stimuli . in light of this , dysregulation of gsk-3 is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of various diseases that are also associated with hypoxia and changed hif- levels , such as type 2 diabetes mellitus , alzheimer s disease , mood disorders , cardiovascular diseases , and cancer.122 thus , given that gsk-3 upstream regulation leads to inhibition of gsk-3 and hif-1 accumulation , this raises the question whether it is an option to target gsk-3 in those diseases and disregard the adverse effects . although research from the last decade has demonstrated that a number of kinase pathways contribute to hif-1 regulation , data for hif-2 or hif-3 are limited .
