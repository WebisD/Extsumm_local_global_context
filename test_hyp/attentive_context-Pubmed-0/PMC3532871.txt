the goal of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and in vitro antifungal and antibiofilm activities of essential oils of the leaves of m. piperita collected in the region of fars from iran .
in addition , the eo inhibited the growth and killed the standard strain of cryptococcus neoformance at the concentration of 4  l / ml . all of the aspergillus standard strains were susceptible to m. piperita eo at concentrations of 0.54  l / ml ( table 3 ) .
the eo inhibited the growth of all of the tested yeasts at concentrations of 0.124  l / ml . furthermore , the eo exhibited fungicidal activity ( mfc ) for all of the above - mentioned yeasts at concentrations ranging from 1 to 8  l / ml .
as shown in table 4 , the eo completely inhibited the biofilm formation of c. albicans and c. dubliniensis at concentrations of 1  l / ml and 2  l / ml , respectively .  
gc / ms analyses showed that the main constituent of the eo was menthol ( 53.28% ) followed by menthyl acetate ( 15.1% ) and menthofuran ( 11.18% ) .
in this study , the eos exhibited fungistatic and fungicidal activities against both of the standard and clinical strains of candida species at concentrations ranging from 0.5  l / ml to 8  l / ml , which can be best compared to the previous investigations   .
