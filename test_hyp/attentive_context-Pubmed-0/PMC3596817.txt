metaphase spreads from cultured lymphocytes were prepared and analyzed by fish using bac probes containing the tcr locus ( tcr c-17317 and tcr v-rp24 - 74e19 ) , the igh locus ( igh v-224m14 ) , igh c ( from c1- 3of c ) and a telomere - repeat specific peptide nucleic acid ( pna ) probe ( applied biosystems ) .
tetraspeck fluorescent microspheres ( molecular probes / invitrogen ) 0.1 m and 0.5 m in diameter were imaged using the same microscope parameters and used to model the point spread function of the microscope , fluorescence channel alignment , and to determine the validity of the mipav software to accurately measure the center of intensity mass of a fluorescence object .
three dimensional fish on freshly isolated thymocytes using tcrv and tcrc locus specific probes was performed as described .
the following tcr probe sets were used : rp24 - 334b8 and rp23 - 255n13 ( proximal ) , rp24 - 74e19 and 17317 ( middle ) , rp23 - 304l21 and rp23 - 10k20 ( distal ) and as control rp23 - 309a8 and rp24 - 336f10 which are separated by 1 mb and map to mouse chromosome 1d .
