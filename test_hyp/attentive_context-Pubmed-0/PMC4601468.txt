transfusion - associated ( ta ) gvhd is a rare but probably underdiagnosed disorder , which , although usually fatal , may evolve into chronic graft - versus - host disease .
a 55-year - old female presented with complaints of increased pigmentation all over body since 4 years .
we hereby report a case of graft versus host disease occurring 6 months post blood transfusion .
graft versus host reaction ( gvhr ) is the expression of gvhd in a specific organ .
the gvhd syndrome has traditionally been subdivided into two syndromes : acute gvhd and chronic gvhd .
graft versus host disease refers to the inflammatory and/or fibrosing manifestations that may arise at various times after transplantation of any organ containing lymphoid cells , which react against and damage tissues in the immunocompromised host .
the disease affected skin , mucosa , hair and nails of the patient with no systemic symptoms and histology was suggestive of lichenoid gvhd . 

graft versus host disease can be induced when blood products containing viable lymphocytes engraft in recipients after transfusion .
there is an extremely high fatality rate for established acute ta gvhd , reaching 90% in some reports .
