here , we report a case of congenital epulis in a newborn female on the right alveolar ridge , along with an extensive review of literature and discuss the immunoprofiling .
congenital epulis is a rare lesion of the newborn , presenting as mass in the oral cavity which can interfere with respiration and feeding .
early diagnosis of ce in a newborn is of paramount importance in the successful management of these rare cases .
it should be distinguished from other lesions which can occur in newborns , both clinically and histopathologically .
congenital gingival granular cell tumor ( cgct ) of the newborn , also known as congenital granular cell lesion , congenital epulis , congenital myoblastoma ( historically ) , or neumann 's tumor , is a rare non - neoplastic lesion seen only in newborns ( 1 ) .
a newborn female child was referred to our institute , immediately after delivery for examination of a mass protruding from her mouth .
congenital epulis of the new born is a widely accepted term and few prefer it over congenital granular cell tumor , which is suggestive of a neoplasm ( 4 ) .
ce has not recurred even after incomplete excision , and has no tendency for malignant transformation .
