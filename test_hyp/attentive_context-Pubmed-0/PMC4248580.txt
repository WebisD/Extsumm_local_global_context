the objectives of this meta - analysis , therefore , were to investigate the overall scope of exposure to pesticides and rural environments with the risk of als by including studies for broad categories of exposure assessment categories such as rural residence , farmers , and pesticide exposure .
the estimates for als had a tendency to be significant as the order of accuracy for pesticide exposure indicators , and the risks were higher in men , in studies using el escorial criteria and in those using expert judgment , compared to their counterparts .
pesticide exposure showed a significantly increased risk of als for studies with case - control design ( or , 1.49 ) , among males ( or , 1.96 ) and with applied expert judgment exposure assessment ( or , 2.04 ) .
these meta - analyses present overall scopes of categories for exposure to pesticide and/or rural environment assessment such as rural residence , farming occupation , and pesticide exposure , which help us to more comprehensively understand the relation between als and exposure to pesticides . considering that farmers are commonly frequently exposed to pesticides at a high level ,
ors for pesticide exposure were still significant ( or , 1.40 ; 95% ci , 1.10 - 1.79 ) ( data not shown ) .
