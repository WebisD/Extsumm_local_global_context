we explored the relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis in a double - blind , randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of vitamin d supplementation on cessation of pain in proven endometriosis after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment .
mean dysmenorrhea was 2.102.33 in the vitamin d group and 2.732.84 in the placebo group ( p=0.45 ) .
the mean pelvic pain score in the vitamin d group was 4.053.45 and 4.824.1(p=0.513 ) in the placebo group . before laparoscopy , the mean dysmenorrhea pain score in the vitamin d group was 7.372.61 and in placebo group it was 6.423.04 ( p=0.325 ) . table 2 shows a comparison between the 2 groups for severity of pelvic pain and/or dysmenorrhea at different time points ( before laparoscopy , in second menses after laparoscopy , and at 24 weeks after laparoscopy ) . at the second menses after laparoscopy , there was no significant difference between the 2 groups for pelvic pain ( p=0.583 ) and dysmenorrhea ( p=0.365 ) , and at 24 weeks after laparoscopy there was no significant difference between mean pain scores in the 2 groups . mean pelvic pain at 24 weeks after laparoscopy in the vitamin d group was 0.841.74 and in placebo group it was 0.681.70 ( p=0.513 ) .
