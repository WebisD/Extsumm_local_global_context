what is more , computer simulations probing 
 pt mechanisms should include an explicit treatment 
 of the hydrated excess proton ( along with its full physics of grotthuss 
 shuttling and charge defect delocalization ) to properly capture the 
 coupling between water dynamics , hydration , and pt .
herein , multiscale 
 reactive molecular dynamics ( ms - rmd ) is used 
 to study pt through a cnt penetrating a graphene sheet .
this 
 finding has widespread implications for pt through hydrophobic ( and 
 likely other ) regions in molecular systems such as proteins , by demonstrating 
 that protons can dynamically create their own solvation pathways that 
 would not be detected by experimental or computational means in absence 
 of an explicit protonic charge defect .
the two - dimensional free energy surface reveals 
 a three - step mechanism by which the protonic charge defect is transiently 
 stabilized at the nanotube entrance , facilitates nanotube wetting 
 via grotthuss - facilitated water migration through the charge defect , 
 and then traverses a lower free energy barrier for grotthuss shuttling 
 proton permeation via activated ( infrequent event ) dynamics .
when hydrophobic 
 cavities are encountered , i.e. , those lacking crystallographically 
 resolved water molecules , simulations have often been used to try 
 to identify states of the system ( e.g. , via oxidation state or conformational 
 changes ) that induce wetting . in this manner , mechanisms of pt have 
 been proposed based on the existence and stability of hydrogen - bonded 
 water wires . however , the simulations presented herein suggest that 
 the excess proton itself is strongly coupled to the solvation structure 
 and stability in nanoconfined spaces and hence must be explicitly 
 included in the analysis of internal solvation . by
