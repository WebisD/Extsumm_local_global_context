we here report two cases of postoperative csw syndrome after a cranial vault remodeling surgery .
therefore , csw syndrome should always be considered when a child patient with a cns lesion manifests hyponatremia and polyuria .
we report our experience of two cases of children with csw syndrome after cranial surgery .
the patients manifested natriuresis , polyuria , and hypotension , and showed improvement with the supply of water and sodium with 0.9% normal saline .
the treatment of csw syndrome is to supply sufficient water and sodium through a normal saline solution ( 7 ) .
a 21-month - old boy had an operation for syndactyly of both hands at 6 months after the birth , and then underwent cranial vault remodeling due to craniosynostosis with a chief complaint of trigonocephaly in the department of plastic surgery .
they described a clinical entity in which central nervous system disease was associated with hyponatremia and paradoxically increased the renal sodium excretion .
csw syndrome is a disease that leads to hyponatremia resulting from the renal loss of sodium in the presence of disorders of the central nervous system ( 6 ) and is different in its pathogenesis from siadh showing dilutional hyponatremia due to an increase of antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) .
