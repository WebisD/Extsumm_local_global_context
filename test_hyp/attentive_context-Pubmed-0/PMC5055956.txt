if an association between low serum levels of vitamin d and higher risk of early implant failure could be demonstrated , the clinician could give a set dose of vitamin d in the weeks before surgery , in order to normalize serum levels and obtain a positive effect on the healing process .
our retrospective clinical study aimed to investigate if there is a link between low levels of vitamin d in the blood and an increased risk of early implant failures . although the incidence of early implant failures was higher in patients with low serum levels of vitamin d , our study failed in proving an effective link between low levels of vitamin d in the blood and an increased risk of early implant failure .
the purpose of this retrospective study was therefore to investigate any possible correlation between low blood levels of vitamin d and early implant failure ( failure occurring in the four months prior to the full restoration of the implant , because of a lack of osseointegration or because of infection ) .
statistical analysis reported a rather low incidence of early failures ( 2.2% ) in patients with blood vitamin d levels > 30  ng / ml . the incidence of early failure was almost double in patients with insufficient serum levels of vitamin d ( 1030  ng / ml ) and became even higher ( 9.0% ) in patients with serious vitamin d deficiency . although the statistical analysis revealed a trend toward an increased incidence of failure in patients with severe vitamin d deficiency , the analysis did not reveal a statistically significant difference ( p = 0.15 ) in the incidence of early implant failure in these three groups of patients .
