viewed in an evolutionary context , the existence of severe disease presents a population - level compromise for the parasite between the necessity of bearing factors that increase survival and transmission and the risk that these will stimulate a host immune response that will either curtail the infection or perversely cause the death of the host ( thus also spelling the end for the parasite ) . with the aim of identifying factors that may be relevant in the evolution of this balance , long et al . in a recent article in bmc evolutionary biology   have investigated the influence of the inflammatory response on the severity of disease in a rodent model of malaria , and we discuss here how their results may bear on the coevolution of parasite and host , in the context of what is known about the determinants of severe malarial disease in humans .
and yet the number of malaria infections which go on to become life threatening is proportionally very small , as the majority of these infections either remain asymptomatic ( due to the acquisition of clinical but non - sterile immunity after repeated exposure ) or progress to disease without lethal complications .
