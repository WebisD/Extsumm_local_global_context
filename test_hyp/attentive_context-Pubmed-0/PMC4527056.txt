the use of leukoreduced wb and prbcs could possibly reduce the incidence of atrs in general and fnhtrs in particular .
this study was carried out with the objective of observing and analyzing the acute transfusion reactions ( atrs ) encountered in the blood bank of this remote north eastern teaching hospital .
the overall incidence of transfusion reactions in this hospital is slightly higher than those having more advanced transfusion facilities in india .
allergic reaction was the most frequently encountered transfusion reaction ( 65.6% ) [ figure 1 ] , which was most commonly seen with prbcs ( risk of 0.76% ; p = 0.42 ,  = 0.63 ) and wb ( risk of 0.68% ; p = 0.63 ,  = 0.23 ) [ table 2 ] .
however , a significant association was observed between the number of prbc transfusions and febrile reactions .
this was followed by febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions ( fnhtrs ) ( 28.1% ) , which was seen more commonly with prbcs ( risk of 0.57% ; p = 0.016 ,  = 5.7 ) .
a total of 650 units of fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) transfusions were carried out that finally resulted in four reactions ( p = 0.36 ,  = 0.84 ) .
