this is a previously unreported rare case of brainstem cryptococcal abscess mimicking brain tumors in an immunocompetent host without having any apparent typical cryptococcal meningeal symptoms and signs with resultant good neurosurgical recovery .
this 47-year - old man presented with a history of progressively worsening headache and nausea for 1 month and several days of vomituritions before admission .
in addition , the clinical pictures of immunocompromised mycotic infections had been different with one another and investigative studies had been diversely accumulated hitherto . however , pathogenic fungal infections in an immunocompetent had been rare and neglected into clinical studies .
this 47-year - old man presented with a history of progressively worsening headache and nausea for 1 month and several days of vomituritions before admission .
especially cryptococcal brainstem abscess mimicking brain tumors had been also much more rare maybe due to blood brain barrier competence and indolent characteristics of such infections in an immunocompetent .
usually fungal infections caused by opportunistic and pathogenic fungi were an important cause of morbidity and mortality among in patients having severe basic internal diseases , and also the sufferers did not have any characteristic significant symptoms . and the epidemiology , transport , and pathogenic mechanisms had not been well known .
