the purpose of this study was to make a comparison between obese and non - obese patients with pcos and control subjects with regard to concentrations of inflammatory markers ( neopterin , il-6 , tnf- , n / l ratio , and crp ) and vitamin b12 , which might pose a risk for atherosclerosis in patients with pcos , and to investigate the correlation between the examined concentrations and the hormonal anthropometric and cardiometabolic parameters .
inflammatory activity is increased in patients with pcos , can lead to an increased risk for atherosclerosis , and this increase is not caused by obesity but rather by the polycystic ovary syndrome itself .
a meta - analysis reported increased wbc and crp levels in patients with pcos , and the increase was found to be independent of obesity .
total - c and tag levels and lh / fsh ratio were significantly higher in the non - obese group with pcos compared to control subjects ( p 0.001 , p 0.007 and p 0.024 , respectively ) .
whr and fg scores , which were used for rating of hirsutism , were significantly higher in both obese and non - obese patients with pcos compared to control subjects ( p 0.000 and p 0.000 ; p 0.000 and p 0.024 , respectively ) .
