we have developed 
 a method to determine membrane structure ( number 
 density and area per lipid ) and bending rigidity from md simulations 
 of lipid vesicles .
the vesicle membrane geometry raises a new and more difficult challenge : 
 obtaining al , structure , and bending rigidity 
 correct by varying the lipid distribution in the two monolayers and 
 the water density inside the vesicle .
the convergence 
 of these three metrics may serve as a simple readout for vesicle equilibration .
although we are currently 
 limited by the accuracy of the simulation force fields , changes in 
 structure that correlate with changes in rigidity may provide insight 
 into the interpretation of experimental results .
any 
 predefined  ,  surface reference frame 
 requires either a real - space filter ( e.g. , arc - length filter ) or a 
 direct spherical harmonic transformation that requires treating every 
 membrane bead as a radial delta function to obtain the urs .
this paper lays the groundwork for an iterative process to improve 
 vesicle construction . with flat - patch membranes ,
removes 
 the fluctuation - induced broadening effect and 
 recovers the underlying structure profile , even under extreme vesicle 
 deformations ( e.g. , elliptical vesicles ) .
