, an effort has been made to evaluate the effect of respiration on the doses to bladder and rectum for patients undergoing cervical intracavitary brachytherapy .
our study shows that respiration affects the bladder and rectal doses in cervix cancer brachytherapy . the dose to irrp was found to be affected with both full and empty bladder whereas the dose to ibrp was found to be affected more with full bladder than with empty bladder .
external beam radiotherapy was delivered to pelvis to a total dose of 50 gy in two phases , 40 gy in 22 fractions by four field box technique in first phase and 10 gy in 5 fractions with midline shield in the second phase .
even though the mean variation in dose to bladder and rectum was within 4% , large individual dose difference was observed in some patients .
fifteen cervix cancer patients of figo stage iib - iiib were included in this study .
the maximum observed variation in doses to ibrp for full and empty bladder among the four respiratory phases was 15% and 3% respectively .
subsequently all of them were treated with high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy to a total dose of 21 gy delivered in three equal fractions at an interval of 1 week . during the procedure ,
