jankovic and beach found that acute dystonic reactions occurred in nine ( 2.3% ) patients and two ( 0.5% ) additional patients had acute oculogyric crises attributed to tetrabenazine.4 we present a case report of a patient suffering from gilles de la tourette syndrome ( gts ) who developed ogc during treatment with tetrabenazine .
oculogyric crisis ( ogc ) , classified as eyeball dystonia , was first described in patients suffering from encephalitis lethargica.1 nowadays , this symptom is more frequently observed as a side effect of treatment with dopamine receptor - blocking drugs ( drbds).2 it manifests as spasmodic deviations of the eyeballs , mainly upward but also in other directions , lasting from a few minutes to several hours.3 it occurs during the first hours or days after the introduction of drbds .
the resolution of ogc after a reduction in the dosage of tetrabenazine , which probably resulted in enhanced dopaminergic transmission , is compatible with the theory that the decrease of dopamine transmission induced by tetrabenazine could also be involved in the pathogenesis of acute dystonia .
acute ogc seems to be a rare complication in the treatment of gts patients because , nowadays , mostly second - generation drbds are used to alleviate tics .
