the aims of this cross - sectional study were to assess the periodontal status of a group of postmenopausal women receiving hrt , and to evaluate the association between hrt and clinical measures of periodontal disease including attachment level , pocket depth and gingival bleeding .
the percentage of gingival sites with positive bop was significantly lower in the hrt+ group compared to the control group ( 34.85% vs. 65.15% ; p=0.0007 ) ( table 1 ) .
the findings of the present study indicate that , in postmenopausal women , long - term hrt was not associated with significant effects on periodontal status and clinical measures of periodontitis , thus suggesting that hrt may not confer protection against periodontitis .
women who reported current hrt supplementation ( n=52 ) for at least 5 years were assigned to the hrt + group . the control group ( hrt ) ( n=39 ) consisted of the remaining women .
mean pi were significantly lower in hrt+ women than in hrt women ( p<0.0001 ) .
therefore , based on the current evidence , the intention , dose and regimen of hrt need to be individualized , based on the principle of choosing the lowest appropriate dose in relation to the severity of symptoms and age at onset of menopause . for early postmenopausal women , hrt may be the most effective treatment available for vasomotor and urinary / genital symptoms , and may be still considered a good therapeutic choice to prevent osteoporosis and cardiovascular risk   .
