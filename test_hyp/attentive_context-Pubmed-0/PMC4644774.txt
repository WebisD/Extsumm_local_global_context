the purpose of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of two porcelain repair systems for the metal and porcelain surfaces : the repair system i ( intraoral repair kit , bisco inc . , schaumburg , il , usa ) and the repair system ii ( cojet intraoral repair system , 3 m espe ag , seefeld , germany ) , and the differences in bond strength obtained by two different surface treatments with identical repair system : 1 ) roughening with diamond bur and 2 ) airborne - particle abrasion .
the repair system ii showed similar bonding quality for both metal and porcelain core to the resin composite ( p > .05 ) .
within the limitations of this study , sandblasting and application of the repair system i ( intraoral repair kit ) can be suggested in the case of a fracture with exposed area of body porcelain .
the null hypothesis tested was that , regardless of the repair systems and surface treatments , the bond strength between the core surface ( metal and porcelain ) and resin composite veneer would not be different among the groups .
the application of airborne - particle abrasion with repair system i ( intraoral repair kit ) significantly improved the core - resin composite bonding compared to other repair methods ( p < .05 ) .
