co : cardiac output ; ea : arterial elastance ; eadyn : dynamic arterial elastance ; map : mean arterial pressure ; pp : pulse pressure ; ppv : pulse pressure variation ; sv : stroke volume ; svv : stroke volume variation .
garca and colleagues suggested an approach that would predict whether the hypotensive patient would increase their map in response to intravascular fluid loading .
validation of eadyn thus needs to be done independently both for each device and for different types of patients before this new bedside parameter is used for clinical decision - making .
there is a tight correlation between positive - pressure ventilation - induced changes in arterial pulse pressure ( pp ) , called pulse pressure variation ( ppv ) , and fluid responsiveness .
importantly , as long as the ppv and svv values are great enough to define a slope , this relationship will remain constant and predictive even during spontaneous ventilation and with cardiac arrhythmias because eadyn is independent of volume responsiveness . since all of the commercially available arterial pressure - derived co monitoring devices report ppv and svv , this added eadyn parameter to define those patients needing vasopressors earlier in their management should have a significant impact on resuscitation efficacy . before embracing this approach and these findings totally , caution needs to be used in its routine bedside application .
