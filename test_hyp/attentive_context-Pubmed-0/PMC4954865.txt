this article presents the crucial role of ultrasound imaging in the establishment of a clinical diagnosis of bartonellosis ( i.e. cat scratch disease ) and implementation of effective therapy in a patient after allogenic hsct with severe atypical infection involving multiple organs .
a seven - year - old girl received hsct from an unrelated donor due to severe aplastic anemia .
since it is difficult to conduct microbiological tests in the course of infections caused by atypical pathogens in immunocompromised patients , repeated ultrasound examinations are useful in the diagnostic process of infective changes in organs . in the case presented above , a clinical diagnosis of bartonellosis was established on the basis of an ultrasound image , which enabled effective therapy .
infection belongs to the most common complications after human stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) and constitutes one of the major causes of transplantation - related mortality .
such lesions could be present in candidiasis , which was unlikely in our patient considering the progression of the disease despite intensive anti - fungal therapy , negative microbiological tests and effective treatment targeted to atypical bacteria .
immune deficiency , which persists after hsct for over a year , can be the cause of an atypical and sometimes abrupt course of infectious diseases , characterized by rapid multi - organ spread of pathogens and their resistance to treatment .
