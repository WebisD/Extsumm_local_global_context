cardiac perforation is a dreaded complication of transvenous pacemaker , cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator ( crt - d ) , and implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ( icd ) lead placement because of the potential for critical morbidity and mortality .
we report the case of a 45-year - old woman affected by severe dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted to our cardiology department for an upgrade of a previously implanted pacemaker .
the patient received a vvi pacemaker implant for complete atrioventricular block 22 years earlier and an upgrade ( ddd mode ) 11 years later .
the unexpected fatal outcome resulted in an allegation of medical negligence against the operating cardiologists .
in addition , her pre - existing myocarditis undoubtedly reduced the chances of successful resuscitation .
leads were inserted through the left subclavian vein : ( a ) an active fixation double catheter in the right ventricle , ( b ) a bipolar active fixation lead in the right auricle ( fig .
moreover , since she was bearing a pacemaker , the patient could not undergo magnetic resonance imaging before the procedure to highlight the thicknesses of the cardiac wall .
, we identified only five cases , , , ,   of atrial damage by a pacemaker lead with concomitant aortic wall perforation , as shown in table 1 .
