we expect that in the near future research on the sexual stages of malaria parasites will be dominated by two major tasks : ( i ) the big hunt for  the gene  , which enables the blood stage parasite to enter the sexual pathway and ( ii ) the analysis of the molecular mechanisms and signaling events of sexual stage parasites during fertilization in the mosquito midgut .
have mostly been studied in the human malaria pathogen p. falciparum , and for these sexual stages , a variety of proteins have been identified and characterized . on the other hand , the implication of malaria sexual stage proteins for malaria transmission was preferentially investigated in the murine p. berghei model , which is more easily accessible for genetic manipulations and transmission studies . up to date
( 3 ) in which way do the sexual stages interact with factors of the mosquito midgut ?
despite intense work on the sexual stages of malaria parasites , they represent the least understood stages of the parasite 's life cycle . gametocyte differentiation and gametogenesis
this review addresses the role of gametocytes during malaria transmission and particularly discusses the recent findings on gametocyte activation following entry of the mosquito midgut , as well as their egress from the host erythrocyte and transformation into gametes .
