  calcification in the cyst walls is a common finding on imaging for jfcs , appearing as peripheral areas of high attenuation on computed tomography ( ct ) and peripheral hypointensity on t1- and t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri).8

 13 we present here an unusual case of a jfc presenting as a giant , multilobular , completely calcified mass with significant extraforaminal extension .
the patient was a 57-year - old woman who presented with a 2-year history of gradually worsening lower back and left leg pain .
juxtafacet cysts ( jfcs ) are uncommon intraspinal , extradural lesions that arise from the facet joints .
although uncommon , jfcs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions arising from the facet joint , even if they appear calcified and noncystic in nature .
