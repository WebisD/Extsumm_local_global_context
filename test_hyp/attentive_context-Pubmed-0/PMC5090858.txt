this patient with long term serpiginous choroidopathy experienced significant improvement in his visual acuity and ocular coherence tomography outcomes following treatment with autologous bmsc as proscribed in the protocols developed for the scots .
autologous bmsc may prove a valuable addition to the treatment of serpiginous choroidopathy and other retinal conditions demonstrating an immunologic or choroidal component .
serpiginous choroidopathy , also known as geographic helicoid peripapillary choroidopathy , is one of the  white dot syndromes  and is a rare clinical condition responsible for less than 5% of posterior uveitis cases .
it is unassociated with systemic disease , affects young to middle - aged adults and has a high relapse rate as noted by wells and smith ( 2014 ) .
transdifferentiation of the bmsc may also be occurring as evidenced by the increased macular thickening and improved vision , similar to neural transdifferentiation of bmsc transplanted into injured spinal cord tissue noted by vaquero and zurita ( 2009 ) .
these various mechanisms all probably play a role in recovery of visual function in choroidal disease through reduction of residual inflammation and improvement in the existing cellular function .
the visual acuity improved to 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye . at 8 months after surgery ,
