findings from the axept study indicate that the use of a transdermal application may improve patient compliance to anti - ad treatment and caregiver satisfaction .
a sub - study was conducted to perform the linguistic and psychometric validation of the caregiver medication interview ( cmi ) , which is the instrument adopted in the current investigation to assess patient compliance to treatment and caregiver satisfaction .
the secondary purpose of the study was to provide a full description of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of mild - to - moderate ad patients and to draw a sociodemographic profile of their caregivers .
convergent validity of the instrument compared with the vas was also high ( icc = 0.79 and  = 0.72 for items assessing compliance ; icc = 0.92 and  = 0.92 for items assessing satisfaction ) .
the translated version of the cmi showed a high level of internal consistency ( cronbach 's  = 0.74 ) and a high test - retest reliability ( icc = 0.96 and  = 0.94 for items assessing compliance ; icc = 0.98 and  = 0.97 for items assessing satisfaction ) .
the axept study consisted of a main study , which was conducted to primarily compare patient compliance to treatment and caregiver satisfaction with respect to oral and transdermal formulations of anti - ad medications , and a sub - study , which was conducted to validate the cmi instrument .
