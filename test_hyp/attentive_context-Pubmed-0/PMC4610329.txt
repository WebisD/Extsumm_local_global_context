128 healthy full - term neonates of both sexes , were born in january 2009 to february 2010 in seoul st .
then , real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism ( t - rflp ) analysis have quantitatively detected bacterial groups by their phylogenies ( 9 , 10 ) .
the aim of this study was to understand and characterize the microbiota composition of healthy korean newborns in cities .
this study paves the way for future study about modulating microbiota of infant into healthy gut .
this study contributes to further understanding of healthy microbiota and presents preliminary findings to support the
( 3 ) found that the colonization patterns of gas - forming coliforms , especially e. coli , were more prevalent in colicky infants when compared to healthy infants . in a study comparing the healthy microbiota to allergic colitis ,
the main differences were in counts of bifidobacteria , clostridia , and total anaerobes with no significant differences in the growth of lactobacilli , coliforms , and enterococci ( 19 ) . in this study ,
many studies have already proven that low diversity of gut microbiota at an early age is strongly correlated with the development of inflammatory and allergic disease in an affluent society ( 23 , 24 ) . in the cluster analysis ,
