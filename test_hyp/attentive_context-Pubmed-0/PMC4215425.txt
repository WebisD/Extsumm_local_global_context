to our knowledge , this is the first national long - term ( up to 48  months ) examination of the effects of fh on atrophy rates of multiple regions in mci subjects at risk for future ad .
we found that a positive fh was associated with accelerated atrophy rates for three key structures ( amygdala , hippocampus , and entorhinal cortex ) plus cortical gray volume in mci but that the residual fh effect on atrophy rate , after covarying for apoe e4 , was no longer significant for any brain structure .
for example , the fh effect size on the amygdala atrophy rate was 0.17 ( p  <  0.14 ) .
our primary hypothesis was that a positive fh would be associated with greater rate of atrophy in brain regions known to degenerate early in ad such as the hippocampus , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , and cortical gray matter .
the goal of this present analysis was to use adni data to test the effect of fh on longitudinal atrophy rates ( up to 48  months ) of 20 brain regions in subjects with mci .
age and gender , subjects with a positive fh had greater atrophy of the cerebral cortex ( p  <  0.009 ) , amygdala ( p  <  0.01 ) , entorhinal cortex ( p  <  0.01 ) and hippocampus ( p  <  0.053 ) . table  3 depicts the estimated effects and significance of apoe 4 + and fh on longitudinal atrophy rates . in this model , some 15 regions showed a significant apoe4 + effect including all the predicted primary regions ( such as the hippocampus , amygdala , entorhinal cortex and cerebral cortex ) .
