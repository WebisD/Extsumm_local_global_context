the snp rs738409 in pnpla3 is strongly , and independently of total and visceral adiposity , associated with fatty liver but not with insulin resistance or estimates of liver injury .
this variant was not associated with estimates of insulin resistance in any of the three populations or in more than 14,000 control subjects of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study ( 21 ) . considering the strong relationship of liver fat with insulin resistance ( 36,34 ) ,
recently , the first gwa approach searching for genetic variants associated with liver fat identified the rs738409 snp in pnpla3 , encoding patatin - like phospholipase 3 , also known as adiponutrin , as the variant that was by far most strongly associated with liver fat content in three populations ( 21 ) . in the present study , using precise measurements of liver fat and body fat distribution we confirmed the strong relationship of the snp with liver fat .
therefore , pnpla3/adiponutrin may be an important key to understand the mechanisms discriminating fatty liver with and without metabolic consequences and may serve as a useful tool for estimating the risk of fatty liver  induced complications .
thus , hepatic pnpla3 activity most probably directly affects fat accumulation in the liver , a hypothesis that is supported by our finding of a strong positive correlation of hepatic pnpla3 mrna expression with liver triglyceride content in liver tissue samples . of note , in the study by romeo
