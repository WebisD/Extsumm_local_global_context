we wanted to assess the role of all - trans retinoic acid ( atra ) as a rediffrentiating and antineoplastic agent in dedifferentiated thyroid tumor patients in our institute .
we conclude that ra therapy may induce ri uptake and reduce serum tg levels in some patients with dtc , but whether this results in clinically significant response can only be ascertained on long - term follow - up . in our opinion , ra therapy may be beneficial , but definite proof of its efficacy and long - term safety is lacking . other drugs also need to be evaluated for the treatment of ri negative dtc and clinical or biochemical evidence of disease .
ri uptake was demonstrable in six patients , though faintly , while seven cases showed no uptake [ figures 1 and 2 ] .
tg decreased in 2 patients and increased in 11 patients at the end of therapy .
of the six patients with ri uptake , three had biochemical progression and the other three had stable disease .
based on clinical and/or biochemical parameters , four patients had progressive disease , eight had stable disease and one patient showed partial response .
