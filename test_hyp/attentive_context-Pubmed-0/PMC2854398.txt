metabolic syndrome ( mets ) comprises a cluster of abnormalities , with insulin resistance and adiposity as central features   .
, it should be emphasized that the justification for the use of statins in prevention : an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin ( jupiter )   study showed a clear benefit of statin therapy in patients with crp greater than 2  mg / l , and the published evidence base supports a role for statin therapy in mets .
emerging laboratory and clinical evidence has shown a strong relationship between crp and various features of mets .
further investigation is clearly needed not only to clarify the molecular role of crp in the pathogenesis of mets , but also to shed new light on the role of crp , specifically in mediating vascular effects and conferring increased risk of cardiovascular events in mets patients with high crp levels . in this regard
the addition of crp to the present definition of the mets may help identify patients at high risk for future diabetes and cvd .
five diagnostic criteria for mets have been identified by the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel iii ( ncep - atp iii ) , and the presence of any of these three features
