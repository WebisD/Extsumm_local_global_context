we report the case of a patient who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with gallstone spillage 34 months before presenting to the thoracic surgery service .
due to the chronic infiltrate in his lung , a thoracotomy was performed that revealed erosion of the stone through the right diaphragm with formation of a lung abscess .
a high index of suspicion for a gallstone - related problem should be entertained by the practitioner when presented with a patient who has a right lung infiltrate and a history of open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
gallbladder perforation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy occurs in 10% to 32% of patients , with gallstone spillage in 0.2% to 20% of cases .
a lower lobe infiltrate was noted and treated successfully with oral antibiotics . over the next 2 years , the patient 's symptoms waxed and waned .
the patient first complained of streaks of hemoptysis at 6 months from the time of the original procedure .
if stone spillage occurs during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy , documentation in the chart would be valuable to clinicians following the patient , allowing them to have a high clinical suspicion when abdominal or thoracic symptoms occur .
a 73-year - old man with a past medical history of hyper - tension and chronic obstructive lung disease presented with a 4-month history of biliary colic and mild pancreatitis .
