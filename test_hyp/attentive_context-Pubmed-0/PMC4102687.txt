we report here a 9-yr - old boy with php ia with a nonsense mutation of c.637 c > t in the gnas gene , which is novel .
pseudohypoparathyroidism ( php ) is a disorder of end - organ resistance primarily affecting the actions of parathyroid hormone ( pth)1 ) .
php - ia is caused by heterozygous mutations affecting one of the 13 gnas exons encoding gs alpha4 ) .
9-year - old boy was admitted to hallym university medical center with painful subcutaneous soft tissue masses with calcifications on the right toes and posterior chest wall . he had a history of repeated convulsive episodes from the age of 2 months .
although we could not obtain molecular data from the maternal family of the patient , considering variation of phenotypes due to genomic imprinting , we were able to explain that the patient had the genotype and phenotype of php ia . in the maternal family of the patient ,
there is some evidence to suggest that the gs alpha mutation is paternally transmitted in patients with pphp and maternally transmitted in patients with php - ia .
the gnas gene is located on chromosome 20q13.11 and consists of 13 exons and 12 introns3 ) .
