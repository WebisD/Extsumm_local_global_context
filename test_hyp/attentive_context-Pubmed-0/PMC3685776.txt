the levels of bun in groups ii , iv , and v , and the serum levels of cr in groups ii and v were increased significantly after the experiment ( p < 0.05 ) .
the animals were divided into five groups ( 10 rats each ) as follows : on the first day ( before experiment ) and the final day ( day of sacrificing ) , serum samples were obtained to measure blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and serum creatinine ( cr ) for all the rats .
group i , sham group ; group ii , positive control group treated with gentamicin ; group iii , treated with metformin ; group iv , treated with gentamicin for 10 days and post - treatment with metformin for the next 10 days ; and group v , co - administration of metformin and gentamicin for 10 days . the symbols ( * ) and
therefore , we aimed to test the potential properties of mf to protect the kidney from gm - induced acute renal failure . also , finding whether delayed treatment with mf exerts similar benefits on gm - induced renal toxicity in rats was the second aim of this study .
