the aim of this study was to test the effects of cycling exercise on the balance and gait 
 abilities of chronic stroke patients .
therefore , this 
 study investigated the effects of stationary cycling exercise on the balance and gait 
 abilities of chronic stroke patients .
significant 
 difference , paired t test : * p < 0.05 ; significant difference , independent t test : 
 p < 0.05 , the experimental group showed significant improvements in bbs , tug test , and 
 10mwt scores after the intervention ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas the control group showed 
 significant improvements in their tug test and 10mwt scores , but not in their bbs score ( p 
 < 0.05 ) . moreover , the experimental group showed greater improvement than the control 
 group in 3 outcome measurements ( p < 0.05 ) .
the results demonstrated that the stationary cycling 
 exercise supplemented with conventional therapy led to better balance and gait abilities 
 than the conventional therapy alone .
based on the results , stationary cycling training can be 
 effective in rehabilitation of stroke patients with gait and dynamic balance deficits .
the patients in the experimental group 
 performed the cycling exercise 30 minutes a day , 5 times a week for 4 weeks .
