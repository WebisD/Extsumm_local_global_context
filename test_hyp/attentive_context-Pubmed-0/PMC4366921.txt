here we are reporting two cases of mma in infants presented with severe high ag metabolic acidosis mimicking as dka in one case and septic shock in an another case even without any initial apparent symptoms .
the unusual presentation of our patients , mimicking dka and septic shock reminds us of the wide spectrum of clinical signs of organic acidemia . in very young patients with severe acidosis and metabolic decompensation , or
with atypical clinical course should lead a suspicion of a less common diagnosis such as organic academia to prevent severe morbidities and even death .
methylmalonic acidemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which there is a deficiency in conversion of methylmalonic coenzyme a ( coa ) to succinyl coa .
methylmalonic acidemia ( mma ) encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders that is characterized by impaired metabolism of methylmalonic acid that is generated during the metabolism of certain amino acids ( isoleucine , methionine , threonine , or valine ) .
patients typically presents at the age of 1-month to 1-year with varied presentations of symptoms ranging from poor feeding , vomiting , dehydration , shock , hypoglycemia , hyperammonemia and hyperglycemias with high anion gap ( ag ) metabolic acidosis if left untreated can lead coma or even death .
