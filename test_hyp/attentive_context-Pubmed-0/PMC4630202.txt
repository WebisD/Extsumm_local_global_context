through the block of cyclo - oxygenases-1 and -2 ( cox-1 and -2 ) activity,3 we reported preliminary studies of its usefulness in the treatment of actinic keratoses ( aks).4 cox inhibitors , diclofenac and celecoxib , have also been used for the treatment of aks and squamous cell carcinomas ( sccs).5 the effectiveness of nsaids is attributable to the inhibitory effect on the increased cox-1 and -2 enzyme activity in skin tumors produced after chronic exposure to uvb ( ultraviolet b ) ( accompanying skin inflammation ) .
piroxicam ( pxm ) , an enolic benzothiazine and potent member of the oxicam series , suppresses the synthesis of proinflammatory enzymes , reducing lipid mediators such as prostaglandins ( pgs ) and thromboxane ( txs ) , and also inhibits ornithine decarboxylase ( odc ) induction,1 both pathways participating in carcinogenesis .
we also reported our clinical experience about the effectiveness of local use of pxm as chemopreventive agent on aks and field cancerization .
further studies need to validate the use of pxm on nmsc , exploring its activity on different tumorigenesis pathways and on different histologic subtypes .
further effects of pxm are the inhibition of metalloproteinase-2 activity and induction of apoptosis , determined to have an antiaging effect on skin texture.2 pxm belongs to a class of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) indicated for the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory and degenerative rheumatic diseases ( rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis , and ankylosing spondylitis ) . on the basis of the documented effect of pxm in skin tumorigenesis ,
