we report here a similar case presenting as a retrovesical tumor in a male patient , which was excised with robotic assistance .
male angiomyxoma , athough a rare benign tumour , should be considered in the diferential diagnosis of pelvic mass in a male patient presenting with severe obstructive luts , and robotic assisted excision should be utilised wherever available .
angiomyxomas are benign , locally infiltrative mesenchymal neoplasms with a predilection for the female pelvis and perineum in their reproductive age group .
this is easily done with robotic assistance due to its advantages like three dimentional vision and advanced degree of freedom within the pelvic cavity .
a 62-years - old male presented to us with mild obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) since last 1 year , with a history of acute retention of urine 3 month back with failed catheter free trial .
these tumours often reach too large dimensions before becoming clinically symptomatic and they usually tend to recur after excision . accurate preoperative diagnosis should alert the surgeon to the need for wide excision , which is essential for prevention of local recurrence .
most recently robotic assisted laparoscopic excision has been promising , as seen in our case .
