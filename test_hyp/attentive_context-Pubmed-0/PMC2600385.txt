we also believe that bav is a good candidate for the differential diagnosis of viral encephalitis and meningitis cases of unknown origin in tropical and subtropical asia , where culex mosquitoes are abundant .
this finding implies that a recent reassortment event has occurred and that segments of chinese or vietnamese strains were replaced .
we report isolation of bav in vietnam . the nucleotide sequences of the vietnamese isolates genomic rna segments diverged into 2 phylogenetically distant clusters .
a seasonal increase of viral encephalitis and meningitis cases is reported during the rainy season every year . among these cases ,
50%70% are diagnosed as japanese encephalitis , while the rest of them remain idiopathic ( p.t .
i , the cluster including the javanese jkt-6423 strain ; ii , the cluster specific to the jkt-6969 and jkt-7043 strains ; iii , the cluster including chinese bavs ; iv , the cluster including the vietnamese 02vn018b strain ; v , the cluster including the vietnamese 02vn180b strain .
two strains were clearly different from chinese and javanese bavs ( 02vn078b and 02vn180b ) .
analysis of segment 12 showed that cluster iii ( table 2 ) contained 2 vietnamese strains ( 02vn178b and 02vn018b ) and the chinese strains af052030 and yn-6 ( isolated in yunnan province ) and bj95 - 75 ( isolated in beijing ) .
