all cad / cam systems consist of three components : ( 1 ) a digitization tool / scanner that transforms the geometry into digital data that can be processed by the computer .
the uniqueness of this report does not lay in the case selection itself , but the use of cad / cam technology which makes it possible to produce restorations faster with precision- fit and good esthetics overcoming the errors associated with traditional ceramo - metal technology .
last but not least , cad / cam technology has made it possible to machine newer materials such as the high - performance oxide ceramics and titanium with high accuracy that meet industrial standards .
these include appropriate tooth preparations with rounded contours and the creation of a continuous preparation margin , which is clearly recognizable to the scanner .
the combination of advancements in dental materials as well as in computer technology has made computer - assisted design / computer - assisted manufacturing ( cad / cam ) fabricated restorations possible and plentiful in dental clinics .
cad / cam technologies have started a new era of procedures and restorations in dentistry .
high - performance oxide ceramics are mainly of two types : ( a ) aluminum oxide ( al2o3 ) , and ( b ) yttrium stabilized zirconium oxide ( zro2 , y - tzp ) a high - performance oxide ceramic which when compared to other all - ceramic systems , exhibits superior mechanical properties , high flexural strength ( 900 mpa to 1200 mpa ) , and higher fracture toughness ( 6 mpa to 10 mpa m1/2 ) .
