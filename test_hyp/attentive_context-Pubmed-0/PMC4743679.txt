therefore , this comparative study analyzed rates of postoperative infection , rejection , long - term survival , and relapse of hepatitis b in hepatitis b carriers receiving slkt at the organ transplant center of the shanghai first people s hospital .
a comparison between slkt recipients with hepatitis b infection and lt recipients with renal insufficiency and hepatitis b infection could provide a more objective assessment of the outcome of slkt associated with hepatitis b. in addition , which indicators can predict the long - term outcomes of liver transplant patients still need to be assessed .
for lt recipients with renal failure , postoperative renal failure and rifle stage were independent risk factors for postoperative deaths .
therefore , slkt can achieve good long - term outcomes in patients with hepatitis b , end - stage liver disease , and renal insufficiency .
this finding suggested that slkt was effective in improving the survival rate of transplant recipients with renal insufficiency . compared with lt alone ,
despite longer hospital stay and higher infection rate at an early stage after surgery , slkt demonstrated satisfactory long - term survival rates in patients with hepatitis b infection . despite a higher rate of hepatitis b relapse following slkt ,
