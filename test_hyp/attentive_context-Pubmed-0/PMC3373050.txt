we report the first evidence of antibodies to wnv in horses and humans in cuba .
finally , expansion of existing mosquito control programs in cuba , which currently focus on aedes aegypti and dengue prevention , may be required to respond to this new public health threat .
the fact that human and horse infections have been detected strongly suggests that a local amplification cycle has been established in cuba .
this study also provides evidence that suggests wnv and slev may co - circulate in cuba .
avian death from wnv infection has been well documented ( 35 ) . however , none of the dead birds collected during this study showed evidence of viral infection .
resident bird species in cuba may be less susceptible to wnv infection , and death rates among birds in the caribbean may be lower than those observed in canada and the united states .
although 1,217 animals were tested , a more intensive dead bird surveillance program may be needed to identify animals that die from wnv infection .
this patient was identified during surveillance in 2004 but may have been exposed to wnv in 2003 . *
these persons are the first to have confirmed cases of wnv - associated illness in cuba .
