therefore , the present study examined the stability of 17 routine chemistry analytes in immediately cell - separated serum following storage at a designated temperature ( 20c ) for different periods ( 0 , 7 , 15 , and 30 days ) using the previously described standard guidelines for blood sample handling and separation .
statistical analysis of selected analytes ; serum samples were stored at -20c for 7 ( t7d ) , 15 ( t15d ) , or 30 ( t30d ) days and then analyzed at room temperature no significant statistical or clinical differences were found among most of the metabolites ( na , k , urea , creatinine , uric acid , total calcium , phosphorus , direct bilirubin , and total bilirubin ) under the different storage conditions .
all common clinical chemistry analytes examined , aside from serum amylase , showed adequate stability following up to 30 days storage at 20c .
significant statistical or clinical differences were observed between serum amylase levels in fresh samples and samples stored at 20c for 7 , 15 , and 30 days ; serum amylase levels decreased with prolonged storage . to the best of our knowledge ,
