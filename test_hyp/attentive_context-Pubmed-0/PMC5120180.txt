we discuss the indications for auricular epithesis implant , the surgical technique , and outcomes .
the pinna epithesis fixed with bone - anchored titanium implants technique is characterized by excellent aesthetic outcome and lasting results .
basically , this approach reflects an evolution of the implants developed for dental prostheses as proposed by brnemark in 1969 , which have been used for over 40 years in the field of odontostomatology and subsequently were proposed for application with osseointegrated craniofacial implants for use with bone - conduction hearing implant solutions   . in our study , we describe our experience using these pinna prostheses in 27 patients treated in the last three years .
our case series comprised 27 patients ( 24 males and 3 females with a mean age of 33.1 years , range 1687 years ) ( table 1 ) .
conductive hearing loss due to malformations of the external and middle ear presents in all subjects affected by microtia and can be corrected by combining the placement of titanium implants for auricular rehabilitation with implantation of the fixture and abutment for a baha . in this way , both the sensory and the aesthetic problems can be resolved in a single operation . however , it should be pointed out that all the patients in our series refused to undergo baha implantation after testing the device prior to surgery ; these patients , being well accustomed to hearing on only one side , found the increased auditory perception provided by the baha disorienting and irritating .
