guillian barre syndrome ( gbs ) is associated in 45 - 75% of cases with cranial nerve involvement .
only two cases has been reported till date with gbs with total paresis of motor cranial nerves . here
a thirteen year old boy presented with acute progressive areflexic flaccid quadriparesis associated with motor cranial nerve involvement with bilateral facial and bulbar weakness .
gbs with multiple cranial nerve involvement can rarely involve the xii nerve as well causing significant tongue weakness and such a presentation may be indicative of a severe nature of the disease and it usually recovers over a period of time .
facial nerve is the commonest to be involved followed by extra ocular muscles and lower cranial nerve involvement .
the cranial neuropathy in our patient showed gradual recovery and tongue atrophy recovered over next three months . at 6 months
gbs with multiple cranial nerve involvement is a known entity but the involvement of xii cranial nerve is extremely rare .
twelfth nerve involvement , either isolated or as a part of multiple cranial nerve involvement is quite uncommon and only two cases has been reported till date as a part of multiple motor cranial nerve involvement in a case of gbs .
