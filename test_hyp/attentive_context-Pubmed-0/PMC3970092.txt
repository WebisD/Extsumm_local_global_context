this unique human head surrogate is based on refreshed human craniums and surrogate materials representing human head soft tissues such as the skin , dura , and brain . a methodology for refreshing the craniums
is developed and used in a series of experiments in which non - perforating ballistic impact of combat helmets is performed .
based on a relatively large number of tests , the swri human head surrogate has demonstrated great potential for providing insights in to injury mechanics resulting from non - perforating ballistic impact of combat helmets , allowing for a direct measure and assessment of behind helmet blunt trauma injuries .
sensors embedded in the human head surrogates allow for direct measurement of intracranial pressure , cranial strain , and head / helmet acceleration .
this human head surrogate is designed to fill the void between post - mortem human subject testing which has biofidelity but handling restrictions and commercial ballistic head forms which have little biofidelity but are easy to use .
the swri human head surrogate ( hhs ) is developed and applied for assessing behind helmet blunt trauma injuries .
experiments include both baseline combat helmets and helmets with a supplemental ceramic applique for addressing larger caliber threats .
