the aims of the study were to evaluate the influence of distance from the road on the content of lead and cadmium in aboveground parts of three grass species near a fast road and to assess bioaccumulation of these elements by morphological parts of the grasses .
the grass species recommended for sowing of land contaminated with lead is d. glomerata , and that contaminated with cadmium , alopecurus pratensis
the grass species recommended for sowing of land contaminated with lead is d. glomerata , and that contaminated with cadmium , alopecurus pratensis the average lead content in the above parts of tested grass species d. glomerata , arrhenatherum elatius , and alopecurus pratensis amounted to 3.56 , and for cadmium , it is 0.307  mg  kg dm , which indicated even lower values than the standard adopted for the feed using of grasses .
the average lead content in the above parts of tested grass species d. glomerata , arrhenatherum elatius , and alopecurus pratensis amounted to 3.56 , and for cadmium , it is 0.307  mg  kg dm , which indicated even lower values than the standard adopted for the feed using of grasses.there were significant differences in the content of lead and cadmium in the studied species of grasses .
