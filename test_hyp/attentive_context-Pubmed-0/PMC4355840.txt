the 2 ndp spanned across many areas of interest with regards to the emerging use of wsi and related it tools in clinical routine .
judging from the history of digitization of radiology imaging , there is reason to believe that the nordics will continue to be a forerunner in clinical use of digital pathology .
feedback from attendees indicates that this sharing of knowledge and experiences across organizations , disciplines , and sectors is an important catalyst for development of best practices and overall progress .
while perhaps not reflected by its regional name , ndp aims to be a venue of broad international interest where state - of - the - art in digital pathology is discussed and advanced .
organizing ndp 2014 has been a very rewarding experience , and we welcome attendees from all over the globe to future gatherings of this group .
efforts to advance the field are taking place around the world . in the nordic countries ( sweden , denmark , norway , finland , and iceland ) , there is a particular concentration of development work towards clinical use of whole slide imaging ( wsi ) . for example , all routine histology slides are today scanned in the hospitals of linkping and kalmar and extensive digital primary review is performed , and > 60 wsi scanners have been installed in sweden to date . against this backdrop , the nordic symposium on digital pathology ( ndp ) was created to promote knowledge exchange regarding the state - of - the - art in digital pathology .
