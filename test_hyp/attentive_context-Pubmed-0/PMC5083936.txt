the selective melatonin receptor agonism effect of ramelteon is useful for insomnia.1 ) here we wanted to present a refractory chronic migraine case , who had significant improvements in migraine after using ramelteon .
the use of ramelteon , a kind of mt1 and mt2 agonist , could also relieve the pain even lack of free radical scavenger effects.3 ) the state - of - art treatment of refractory chronic migraine also includes the ramelteon due to selective m1 receptor agonism.6 ) from the successful experience in this case , we can consider the use of ramelteon for refractory chronic migraine with insomnia .
in this case , we found significant improvements in migraine severity and insomnia after the use of ramelteon . since the patient did nt have insomnia before the first onset of migraine .
the modulation of serotonin system by the ramelteon would also relieve the pain sensation.2 ) in addition , the chemical structure of ramelteon was similar with that of indomethacin , which is a kind of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory medicine.2 ) in the study of animal model , the antinociceptive and antiallodynic actions of melatonin have been observed in different kinds of pathways , such as intrathecally or intracerebroventricular routes .
