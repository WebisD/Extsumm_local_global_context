this project contains a bundle of 10 recommendations aimed at improving prescription of antibiotics , detection and prevention of cross - colonization of mdr pathogens , and elimination of reservoirs .
a scientific expert committee ( sec ) for the development and implementation of this program was appointed as follows : semicyuc nominated nine intensivists chosen for their expertise in the field of prevention and management of infections in the critical care setting and seeiuc designated an intensive care nurse with experience in infection control .
the spanish society of intensive care medicine and coronary care units ( semicyuc ) and the spanish society of intensive care nursing ( seeiuc ) have recently completed their role as technical lead for two programs aimed at reducing icu - acquired infections , namely catheter - related bloodstream infections [  zero bacteremia  ] and ventilator - associated pneumonia ( vap ) [  zero vap  ] .
bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing day by day , particularly in hospitals , with a significant impact on mortality and morbidity .
over the last few decades , a dramatic worldwide increase in infection rates by multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) pathogens has occurred , which is acknowledged as a public health crisis .
