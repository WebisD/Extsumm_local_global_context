therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of trampoline training intervention on anthropometric variables and physical fitness components of 1114-year - old male students , iran .
characteristics of the study participants differences between pre- and post - training of anthropometric and physical fitness indicators in the trampoline and control groups post hoc paired t - tests indicated statistical significant differences in trampoline group between the two measurements about calf girth ( t = 4.35 , p = 0.001 ) , fat% ( t = 5.87 , p = 0.001 ) , vertical jump ( t = 5.53 , p = 0.001 ) , and long jump ( t = 10.00 , p = 0.001 ) .
based on these finding , we can conclude that a 20-week trampoline training with four physical activity sessions / week in 1114-year - old students seem to have a significant effect on body fat% reduction and effective results in terms of anaerobic physical fitness .
post hoc paired t - tests showed statistical significant differences in control group between the two measurements concerning calf girth ( t = 5.67 , p = 0.001 ) , vertical jump ( t = 3.88 , p = 0.002 ) , and long jump ( t = 4.22 , p = 0.001 ) .
