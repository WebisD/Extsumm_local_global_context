a 36 year old , para 2 female with a history of chronic right adnexal pain was admitted for a laparoscopic right salpingo - oophorectomy .
previous surgeries included an abdominal hysterectomy for a fibroid uterus , laparoscopic left salpingooophorectomy and lysis of adhesions for pelvic pain , an appendectomy , two previous cesarean sections , a bilateral tubal ligation and an inguinal herniorrhapy as a teenager .
we believe that some small bowel perforations from 2 mm instrumentation can be managed conservatively without suturing provided that the site of injury is not actively leaking stool nor bleeding .
except for an initial fever , the patient responded well to conservative management with bowel decompression , antibiotic therapy and close observation .
conditions requiring a laparotomy following a bowel perforation include any sign of peritonitis , persistent fever , ileus or prolonged vomiting .
on the evening of surgery , the patient developed a fever of 101.2 degrees fahrenheit .
most of the current data on laparoscopic complications is based on case reports and small series .
a microlaparoscope inserted through the entry site confirmed the complication . had we performed traditional laparoscopy using a 10 mm trocar , the site of bowel injury would have required suturing , possibly a laparotomy . in cases where the site of perforation is free of adhesions and in need of repair
