could not be accounted for recovery of the patient from diabetes by 2-week treatment , this led us to think that the plant possibly possessed beta - cell neogenesis activity . to explore this activity , an experimental model with parameters indicative of the status of the beta cells
d - pinitol ( 3-o - methyl chiro - inositol ) is an inositol , a key component of the insulin - related phosphoglycans released from cell membrane on the binding of insulin with its receptor and likely to be participating in the release of phosphoglycans and thereby enhance the activity of insulin or overcome the insulin resistance .
thus , the pharmacological evidence recorded by way of restoration of blood sugar and body weight to near normal and absence of mortality as compared with controls and response of ar - treated animals to a hypoglycemic agent at the end of 6 weeks are indicative of beta cell neogenesis .
this explains for insulin - like effects observed with d - pinitol to improve glycemic control in a number of experimental and clinical studies reported.  d - pinitol is reported to be present in pine needles , chickpeas , alfalfa , soya beans , and other legumes and in bougainvillea spectabilis used in traditional medicine for conditions associated with diabetes .
