each gene was analyzed using a range of substitution and clock models , as well as tree priors , with posterior estimates made from the model that best fit the data as determined by marginal likelihoods estimated in the program tracer v1.5 ( http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer ) .
rates were calibrated by placing an exponential prior distribution ( lower bound = 5 ma , mean = 5.5 ma ) on the divergence of p. humanus ( human ) and p. schaeffi ( chimpanzee ) lice that reflects conservatively recent estimates for the divergence of their hosts ( kumar and hedges 1998 ) .
all available dna sequences for coi ( 108 head and 58 clothing lice ) , 18s rrna ( 10 head and 12 clothing lice ) , ef-1 ( 25 head and 9 clothing lice ) , and rpii ( 25 head and 10 clothing lice ) for p. humanus and the outgroup p. schaeffi ( chimpanzee louse ) were downloaded from genbank ( available as supplementary table s1 , supplementary material online ) .
a louse generation time of 21 days ( 18 generations per year ) and the substitution rates in table 2 were used to convert parameter estimates from mutational to demographic units .
