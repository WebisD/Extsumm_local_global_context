a number of groups have risen to this challenge and have formulated and developed ideas and technologies to improve noninvasive methods to diagnosis boo .
these techniques start with flowmetry , increased interest in ultrasound , and finally the performance of urodynamic evaluation without a urethral catheter .
, noninvasive urodynamics can be used to identify patients with boo , start early medical treatment , and evaluate the results .
research has been done to evaluate the contribution of ultrasound to identifying patients with boo .
the connector should be used to diagnose boo , for the evaluation for surgery , and in screening for treatment . in the future
methods such as the measurement of detrusor wall thickness ( dwt ) , intravesical prostatic protrusion ( ipp ) , and ultrasound - estimated bladder weight ( uebw ) are available . to measure the dwt , it is necessary to use a high - frequency transducer ( 7.5 mhz ) and enlarge by approximately 10 the image of the bladder wall ( fig .
the longevity of the world 's population is increasing , and in male patients , so are the complaints of lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) .
