dengue virus ( denv ) causes most of the world s mosquito - borne viral infections , and is the etiologic agent of dengue fever ( df ) , dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) , and dengue shock syndrome ( dss ) .
one of the first lines of host immunity against denv is the type i interferon ( ifn - i or ifn/ ) response , which inhibits viral replication , and sets the stage for the development of adaptive immunity .
here we review the strategies that denv uses to evade the type i interferon response , and postulate how studying denv ns5-mediated stat2 degradation may contribute to the development of immunocompetent denv mouse models and anti - denv therapeutics .
denv - mediated degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 ( stat2 ) , a component of the ifn/ signaling pathway , has emerged as an important determinant of denv pathogenesis and host tropism .
the study of denv - mediated ifn antagonism and ns5-mediated stat2 degradation in particular has offered insights that could guide the development of an immunocompetent mouse model of dengue disease .
a large portion of the denv genome is devoted to encoding proteins such as ns2b/3 protease , which inhibit ifn/ expression , and ns5 , ns4b , ns2a , and ns4a , which inhibit ifn/ signaling . the ns5 protein of all flaviviruses tested so far have been shown to antagonize ifn signaling though by completely different mechanisms suggesting that the ns5 ifn signaling antagonism function arose independently several times throughout evolution . it is likely that the ns5 protein acquired the ifn signaling inhibition function in each case because the polyprotein - based strategy of flaviviral protein expression results in excess expression of ns5 even though only small amounts are needed for polymerase and transferase functions .
