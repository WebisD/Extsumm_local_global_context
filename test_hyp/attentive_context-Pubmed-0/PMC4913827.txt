the use of rapamycin was associated with decreased concentrations of mcp-1 in plasma and mcp-1 in plasma was negatively correlated to 37-kda , 120-kda , and 146-kda proteins the strongest effect on plasma proteins in rats was shown by regimens based on rapamycin ; intermediate , weak , and the weakest effects were reported for regimens based on cya , tacrolimus , and mmf , respectively .
the present study examined the long - term ( 6 months ) effect of the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs in typical combinations used in patients after organ transplantation on the concentration of plasma proteins of wistar rats via electrophoresis technique .
immunosuppressive drugs cause changes in the proteinogram of plasma proteins . in the groups with regimens based on cya ,
the use of regimens based on cya ( crg and cmg ) was associated with the occurrence of a higher concentrations of 203- , 170- , and 108-kda plasma proteins ( p<0.04 , < 0.01 and < 0.05 , respectively ) , whereas the amount of 54-kda protein was significantly reduced compared to the groups treated with regimens devoid of cya ( trg , tmg , and mrg ) ( p<0.05 ) ( table 4 ) . in the plasma of rats collected from the groups treated with tacrolimus ( the trg and tmg groups ) , we found decreased levels of the 108-kda protein and increased levels of the 103-kda protein ( p < 0.02 and 0.03 , respectively ) ( table 5 ) compared to the groups without drug treatment ( crg , cmg , and mrg ) .
