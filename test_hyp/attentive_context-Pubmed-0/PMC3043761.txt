intervention with stents has become a standard procedure ; in patients with stenosis of the renal artery , placement of a stent is likely to be the initial form of treatment .
treatment of patients with arvd should include consideration of the following factors : age , co - morbidity , blood pressure , renal function , and kidney size .
atherosclerotic renal artery hypertension is reported in almost 7% of adults older than 65 years1 ) and is associated with cardiovascular events , and may double risk of mortality2 ) . in the 1990s , radiological angioplasty began to replace surgical revascularization .
the aim of treatment for arvd should include the prevention of cardiovascular and/or renal events .
most cases of atherosclerotic renovascular disease ( arvd ) are located in the ostium , and are extensions of calcified aortic plaques4 ) .
the results of the coral and the post hoc analysis of astral might provide additional evidence for revascularization .
the results of two recent studies suggest that patients with arvd and stable renal function can be controlled medically .
however , there is limited evidence to support revascularization over medical therapy for patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis7 , 8) .
