the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and type of ecg changes in patients with leptospirosis regardless of clinical evidence of cardiac involvement .
abnormal ecg findings were found in 56 of 97 ( 58% ) patients with serologically confirmed leptospirosis hospitalized at the university hospital for infectious diseases in zagreb , croatia from 2000 to 2009 .
myopericarditis was identified in 4 patients on the basis of physician examination ( muffled first heart sound ) , ecg findings ( non - specific st segment and t wave abnormalities , tachycardia , arrhythmias ) and echocardiography ( table 3 ) . in our patients ,
the first systematic comparative research of ecg findings in a total of 43 patients with leptospirosis and malaria hospitalized from 1960 to 1962 in the british military hospital in malaga and in healthy persons exposed to artificial hyperpyrexia showed that transient ecg abnormalities are similar in patients with leptospirosis and malaria and are nonspecific results of a febrile infection .
the majority of patients were hospitalized from july to october ( 68/97  70% ) and the majority had positive epidemiological anamnesis ( 90/97  93% ) .
the presence of transient ecg abnormalities such as sinus tachycardia , non - specific ventricular repolarization disturbances , bundle branch or ventricular conduction disturbances and atrial fibrillation are common at the beginning of disease and possibly are caused by the direct effect of leptospires or febrile infection with a combination of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities .
