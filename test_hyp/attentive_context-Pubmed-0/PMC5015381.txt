idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) is a heart muscle disorder characterized by systolic dysfunction and dilation of the left or both ventricles in the absence of any other possible cause.1 dcm can develop in people of any age or ethnicity , although it is more common in male than female persons ( occurring at a ratio of 3:1 in male to female persons ) and typically manifests in the third to fourth decades of life.2 , 3 dcm is the predominant cause of cardiomyopathy in both adult and pediatric populations.3 , 4 in adults , dcm has an estimated prevalence of 1:2500.3 in contrast , annual incidence in pediatric populations has been reported to be much lower : 1:170  000 in the united states5 and 1:140  000 in australia.6 
  although pediatric dcm has a lower annual incidence than adult dcm , the outcome for pediatric dcm patients is particularly severe.7 , 8 , 9 dcm is the most frequent cause of heart transplantation ( htx ) in pediatric patients.10 data from international pediatric dcm registries indicate that the rates of death or htx over 1 and 5year periods were 31% and 46% , respectively.4 conversely , recent data showed that the htxfree survival rate in adult dcm patients receiving optimal treatment is > 85% at 8  years.2 
  comparative studies between pediatric and adult dcm populations are currently lacking in the literature .
