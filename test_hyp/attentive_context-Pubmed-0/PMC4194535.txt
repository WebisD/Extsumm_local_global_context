the success of medicare risk contracting in rural areas also will depend on whether increased aapcc rates allow hmos to offer rural enrollees the type of medicare risk products that have competed successfully with medicare supplemental products in higher aapcc urban markets , i.e. , products with zero premiums or low premiums compared with supplemental products , as well as additional benefits such as prescription coverage .
their organizational characteristics resemble those of all hmos with medicare risk contracts ( physician payment review commission and prospective payment assessment commission , 1995 ) .
three of the hmos in the risk sample had pre - tax equity and fiscal responsibility act ( tefra ) of 1982 demonstration projects , five hmos began their medicare risk contracts between the mid-1980s and 1991 , and eight hmos signed contracts after 1993 .
the future of medicare risk contracting in rural areas may depend in part on whether these organizations decide to offer medicare risk products through affiliated hmos , and the degree to which they encourage their medicare supplemental subscribers to move to managed care .
the surveyed hmos include 15 hmos currently serving rural medicare risk enrollees , 1 hmo that recently dropped its medicare risk contract to serve rural enrollees , and 11 hmos that have commercial enrollees in 5 or more rural counties , but no rural medicare risk enrollees .
