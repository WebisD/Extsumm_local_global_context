, we analyzed a whole - genome microarray case - control study of 75 uremia patients and 20 healthy controls included in the national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) gene expression omnibus ( geo ) , and performed a gene co - expression analysis to construct networks of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) in uremia .
gene co - expression network analysis is a useful tool in genomics studies , because of its extraction of genes / mirnas with similar expression patterns from high throughput molecule expression datasets .
meanwhile , the hub module analysis of differentially expressed genes identified clusters of genes with similar expression profiles that are suggestive of co - regulation .
further study of the networks and mirnas identified in this study may allow a better connection of biological functions , genes , and mirnas that underpin the network modules , and in turn could be used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in uremia . in conclusion ,
our study provides a comprehensive perspective of gene expression in uremia using a combination of gene co - expression network analyses and degs analyses to identify nine hub co - expressed modules that can be assigned to corresponding biological functions .
