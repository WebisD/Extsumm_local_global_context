indeed , we suggest ( on the basis of this and many other examples ) that it probably flourishes best when the group is small and the lab head is around most of the time and participating actively in the intellectual and experimental life of all group members on an almost daily basis .
these consequences of genuine novelty are , of course , the fundamental  and fatal  flaw of any measure of scientific accomplishment that uses citation counts , particularly from the first few years after publication . finally , despite the lack of respect they get from most current grant - review panels ,
second , such research benefits from an atmosphere in which all group members share new results and ideas freely with one another and without concern about the ultimate distribution of credit .
the morals of this story are perhaps obvious , but we emphasize some of them here because of their relevance to the current troubled times in academic science .
indeed , it is helpful when this attitude can be extended beyond the immediate group to others , as illustrated in this story by the critical early contributions of don hawthorne , carl robinow , bob mortimer , tom manney , wolfgang duntze , and breck byers .
