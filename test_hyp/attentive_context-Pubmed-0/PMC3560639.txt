the aim of this study was to determine whether the increased number of metabolic syndrome ( ms ) risk factors caused deterioration of the structure and function of the left ventricle in subjects with metabolic syndrome .
this cross - sectional study included 280 consecutive subjects with some cardiovascular risk factors who were sent from the primary care clinic to the echo laboratory at the clinic for cardiology , the clinical centre of serbia , from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2008 .
subjects with 3 criteria had a 4-fold higher prevalence compared to the control group ( or 4.14 , 95% ci : 1.3312.88 , p=0.01 ) , subjects with 4 factors had 4.5-fold greater prevalence ( or 4.5 , 95% ci : 1.3914.59 , p=0.009 ) , while subjects with all 5 criteria of the metabolic syndrome had an almost 10-fold greater prevalence of lv hypertrophy ( or 9.87 , 95% ci : 3.0731.73 , p<0.001 ) . among the patients with ms we noticed that subjects with all 5 risk factors had a higher incidence of lv hypertrophy in relation to the remaining 2 groups ( table 3 )
compared with the control group , all 3 subgroups with ms had a significantly higher prevalence of lv hypertrophy ( table 3 ) .
