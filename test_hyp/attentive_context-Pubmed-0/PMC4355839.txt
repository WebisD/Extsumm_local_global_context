comparison of mean of scores for extended parallel process model constructs and preventive behavior , before and after intervention in the experimental and control groups
the result indicated that there was a significant difference between the mean of scores of perceived susceptibility , perceived severity , perceived response efficacy , perceived self - efficacy , and preventive behavior on cigarette smoking before and after educational intervention in the experimental group ( p < 0.001 ) ; whereas , there was no significant difference between the same variables before and after the educational intervention in the control group ( p > 0.05 ) .
educating skills to resist peer pressure based on the perceived response efficacy of messages and strategies can be effective in the prevention of smoking .
thus , increasing the perceived threat causes an increase in susceptibility and severity of threat in adolescents . on the other hand ,
educational programs based on eppm increased the perceived threat and perceived efficacy for the preventive behavior of smoking .
the extended nature of problems arising from smoking and drug consumption and failure of approaches taken to prevent and to treat are two strong motivating factors to develop and apply new preventive approaches . in this study , after the educational intervention , the mean score of perceived susceptibility declined significantly in the experimental group .
