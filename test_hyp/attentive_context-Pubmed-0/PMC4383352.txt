overall hypoglycaemia rates were significantly higher for patients continuing on gla than for patients switching to det in the humana cohort ( 16 vs. 11% ; p  <  0.05 ) , but overall hypoglycaemia rates were similar in the impact cohort ( 11 vs. 12% ; p  =  0.490 ) . in the present study , to further evaluate the consequences of insulin switching , we used data from patients ' medical records to investigate retrospectively the real - world clinical outcomes for patients with t2 dm who switched between these two basal insulin analogues .
compared with patients in the det - s subgroup , patients in the gla - c subgroup had better clinical outcomes at 1-year follow - up , including lower hba1c levels and significantly higher hba1c reductions .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate retrospectively the real - world clinical outcomes of switching between basal insulin analogues , compared with continuing on previous basal insulin , among patients with t2 dm identified from the us ge centricity emr database .
in addition , significantly more patients in the gla - c subgroup achieved the targeted hba1c levels of  < 7.0% or  < 8.0% and those in the det - s subgroup had significantly higher rapid - acting insulin use .
