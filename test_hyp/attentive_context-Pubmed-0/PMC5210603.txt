drug sensitivity to report whether certain substrates / sites are sensitive to particular parp inhibitors ( 37 ) . with adpribodb , we aim to provide a one - stop portal for the community to search adp - ribosylation substrates and site information , where basic scientists and clinicians can use this cumulative information to understand basic biology of adp - ribosylation , generate hypotheses in examining adp - ribosylation functions and explain clinical benefits and side effects observed in patients at the molecular level .
it is our hope that adpribodb will offer insights into the adp - ribosylated proteome , and may reveal patterns of adp - ribosylation across substrate proteins , and highlight important interactions and networks , which will aid in our understanding of the myriad roles of adp - ribosylation played in cells .
thus , understanding substrate specificity of parps and how protein function is affected by adp - ribosylation are of timely importance and have the potential to improve our understanding of the biology of diseases .
first , given the development of various site identification methods ( 9,14,36 ) , we are expecting that a series of proteome - wide analyses will soon be available for a global survey of adp - ribosylated proteins in cells and tissues .
