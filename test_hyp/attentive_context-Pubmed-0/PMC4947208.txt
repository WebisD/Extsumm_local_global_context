these local bony abnormalities along with the biochemical findings helped us to diagnose this case as an unusual presentation of primary hypogonadism with features of mccune albright s syndrome where there was amenorrhea rather than preocious puberty .
x - ray examination revealed short fourth and fifth metacarpals , short left metatarsal , and short fibula .
the characteristic physical features of short stature , round face , brachydactyly of the fourth and fifth metacarpals and the biochemical findings of normal serum calcium , phosphorus and parathyroid hormone concentrations along with a very low level of gonadotropin hormones led us to the diagnosis of albright s syndrome in this patient who presented to us with primary amenorrhea and hypogonadism .
mccune albright syndrome is rare with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 persons .
the classical clinical triad consists of fibrous dysplasia of the bone , caf - au - lait skin spots and precocious puberty .
she had a short stature , round face , thick neck , and short fourth metacarpals and metatarsals .
serum calcium , phosphorus and parathyroid concentrations were normal , but gonadotropin hormones were very low .
however , the reported menarche was actually an episode of induced bleeding due to an unknown medication provided by a local doctor .
