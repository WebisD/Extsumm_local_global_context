in this case - report , 15-month results of mucogingival surgery after intr were presented . consequently , treated pht survived with healthy gingiva , reduced pocket depth , acceptable mucogingival relationship and new hard tissue formation . from the results of this  single case  lack of baseline periapical radiograph and standardized radiographic measurements , intr supported with fgg may be speculated as an alternative to keep pht for a period of time .
therefore , objective of this report is to present 15-month results of treatment including intr and mucogingival surgery .
the report also aims to underline the contribution of supporting approaches to intr procedure in terms of periodontal tissue support and amount of keratinized gingiva .
in addition , no report represented treatment of pht with a two - step procedure involving intr and free gingival graft ( fgg ) .
a 20-year - old female was referred to kirikkale university periodontology department in june 2011 with mobility and discomfort in mandibular left lateral incisor .
intentional replantation ( intr ) is described as the intervention of purposely removing a tooth and following some extra - oral procedures , replacing it into its socket . despite increasing tendency to be a favored treatment alternative in cases of periodontally hopeless teeth ( pht ) , enhancement of periodontal tissue support and thus , increasing the lifetime and functional quality of replanted teeth is still one of the main concerns .
