usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly .
ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder .
repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele . on reviewing the literature we found that tc - dtpa scan is useful in the evaluation of renal function in patient with known ureteroceles .
a 5-year - old female child was referred to our department for tc - diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ( dtpa ) scan .
however , in our case on finding the photopenia in the ub on tc - dtpa scan , intravesical ureterocele was detected on usg .
this abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography ( usg ) and confirmed by other x - ray investigations after birth .
most of the patients with ureterocele are classically diagnosed during the investigation for uti , asymptomatic hydronephrosis , and abdominal mass .
possible causes for photopenic defects in the ub on nuclear scintigraphic studies include bladder papilloma , bladder polyp , carcinoma bladder , bladder calculus , foreign body in ub , intravesical ureterocele , etc .
