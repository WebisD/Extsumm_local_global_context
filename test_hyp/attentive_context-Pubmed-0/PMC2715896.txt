the aim of this study was to assess the incidence and risk of acquiring cmv infection in pregnant women in an urban area in northern italy in the period 20052007 .
the incidence and risk of cmv infection in pregnancy found in our area , therefore , support the use of serological screening , certainly in the first trimester when the risk of infection is higher and , in the case of seronegative women , possibly also one screening in the second trimester and one in the third .
on the basis of the results of the igg avidity test , the cumulative incidence of cmv infection was 1.4% ( 95% ci : 0.971.83% ) , the density incidence was 0.8% ( 95% ci : 0.471.13 ) , and the risk of infection was 0.5% ( 95% ci : 0.240.76% ) without any significant differences by age .      
the overall prevalence of anti - cmv igg antibodies in our pregnant women was 68.3% ( 95% ci : 66.670.0 ) , without any significant differences between age classes .     
the cumulative incidence of cmv infection ( new cases observed during pregnancy ) calculated on the basis of the 13 cases with low or moderate igg avidity was 1.4% ( 95% ci : 0.971.83 ) , and the risk of infection during pregnancy , calculated on the basis of all of the women ( seronegative and seropositive ) , was 0.5  100 pregnancies ( 95% ci : 0.240.76 ) . the differences in incidence and risk by age was not statistically significant . to take into account the loss to follow - up within the groups and different admission to the study of women during different trimester ,
