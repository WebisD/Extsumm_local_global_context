in this paper we investigated 
 the full photoswitching cycle of 
 an isolated sma molecule by means of the semiempirical on - the - fly 
 photodynamics simulations .
these studies 
 confirm barrierless pt in the first singlet excited state of sma and 
 point to the presence of a conical intersection arising from cc double 
 bond rotation as the main route for radiationless decay to the ground 
 state . in this work we present results of semiempirical on - the - fly 
 photodynamics 
 simulations for the two sma tautomers relevant to photoswitching : 
 the global minimum enol - form and
for the two isomers that play a crucial 
 role in the switching (  and  ) , we find a very efficient 
 internal conversion ( 90% nonradiative decay of the excited 
 state ) that indicates excellent photostability and promising switching 
 efficiency of sma .
our main goal is to investigate the full switching 
 cycle and to determine the characteristic time scales and photoproduct 
 distributions of both the forward and back switching transformations .
the computed time scales characterizing the crucial 
 phototransformations of this model schiff base system are all in the 
 ultrafast regime ( 1 ps and subpicosecond ) .
the strong dependence of the 
 splitting ratio at the ci1 conical intersection on the photoswitching 
 direction probably originates from the ground - state pes topology of 
 the  and  switching forms .
