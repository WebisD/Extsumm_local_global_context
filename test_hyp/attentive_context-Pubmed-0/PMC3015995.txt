this case series confirms previous reports of the low risk of enterotomy , absence of fatal vascular injury , and comparable rates of umbilical infection / hernia associated with an open entry technique .
the rapid recognition of enterotomy with this entry technique , and the utility of this technique in obese patients or those with previous abdominal procedures are additional advantages .
we completed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent laparoscopy via an open technique at the mayo clinic arizona in the department of gynecology ( 8 surgeons ) from january 1 , 1998 through december 31 , 2006 .
a significant association was noted between umbilical infection and previous abdominal surgery ( p=0.049 ) , and between umbilical hernia and obesity ( p=0.024 ) .
patients with subsequent umbilical hernias were subclassified into symptomatic ( noted by a physician or patient ) or asymptomatic ( discovered serendipitously at a subsequent surgery ) ( table 1 ) .
fisher 's exact test was used to determine the association between each of the recorded complications and the number of previous abdominal surgeries and obesity ( bmi>30 ) ( table 2 ) .
intraoperative complications ( bowel and vascular injury , failure to enter ) , postoperative complications ( hernia , hematoma , cellulitis , abscess , cosmetic issues ) , body mass index ( bmi ) , number of previous abdominal surgeries , and length of follow - up were extracted from charts .
