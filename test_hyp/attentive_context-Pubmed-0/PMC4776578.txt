it delivered bidirectional stimuli , and facilities for measuring various parameters of electrical dose had been incorporated in the device . with the demonstration of cognitive superiority and comparable efficacy of brief - pulse ect ,
safety of lithium during ect was satisfactory particularly when serum lithium was at a lower therapeutic range in young patients without significant cardiovascular risk factors . to conclude , the indigenously developed brief - pulse ect - eeg device has been used to treat thousands of patients in the past two decades .
summary of the findings of research conducted utilizing the specific features of the indigenously developed brief - pulse ect device * many more issues related to ect need exploration in future ; these include altering amplitude of electrical stimulus , ultra - brief ect in indications other than depression , novel techniques of different electrode 's sizes , and placements to reduce the cognitive adverse effects without compromising the clinical efficacy . the last author , mr .
the national workshop on ect ( 1988 ) recommended the development of state - of - the - art ect devices with brief - pulse waveform to be available indigenously .
the maximum values of systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and rpp were similar in both groups , suggesting that cardiovascular load is similar in bfect and btect .
