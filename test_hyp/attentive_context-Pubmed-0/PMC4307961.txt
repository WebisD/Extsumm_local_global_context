a recent review of psychobehavioral therapy for epilepsy recommends case reports as a research design to explore specific psychological mediators of seizure self - control .
this case report illustrates how a psychobehavioral intervention addresses cognitive dissonance in order to decrease internal stressors of seizures and was prepared according to the consensus - based care guidelines for standardized clinical case reporting .
in this case of a 16-year - old male , the acquisition of self - organizational skills and the development of seizure interruption techniques correlated with a clinically significant drop of seizures and an increased sense of  being in control  of his seizures . the case exemplifies that motivational strategies may be applied to facilitate the regulation of lifestyle - related seizure precipitants .
his magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) shows extensive bilateral gray matter band heterotopia ( fig .  1 ) .
psychobehavioral approaches attempt to identify the underlying cognitive dissonance creating the intense emotional discomfort that can trigger seizures .
future prospective studies are needed to further investigate the psychological mediators of an individual 's increasing sense of seizure self - control and its actual relationship with seizure frequency .
electroclinical day- and nighttime seizures captured during video - eeg studies displayed seizures with loss of consciousness consisting of irregular shaking of his body correlating with epileptiform activity originating from bilateral parasaggital regions synchronously and tonic posturing of arms originating from the left hemisphere . before losing consciousness , he feels a loss of sensation in some of his body parts , usually starting from his right arm .
