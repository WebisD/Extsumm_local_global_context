so far around 100 cases have been reported worldwide with only one case from india . here , we present two siblings with fucosidosis with characteristic clinical , radiological and laboratory features with a brief review of the literature .
fucosidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disorder , which is inherited in autosomal recessive pattern due to deficient activity of the enzyme alpha l fucosidase .
type i presents in infancy with a very rapid progression of illness and death in early childhood , whereas type ii presents later with lesser severity although it is gradually progressive , and sometimes people survive into adulthood .
an 8-year - old girl presented with features of neuroregression from around 3 years of age .
our patient had classical mri finding , in addition to that our case had t2-weighted hyperintensity of medial and lateral medullary lamina of gp , which passes between the hypointense gp .
have described 22 disease causing mutations in fuca 1 gene , located on the short arm of chromosome 1 , which included point mutations , deletions , insertions , missense and inactivating mutations .
our case had coarse facies with sociocognitive and motor regression , telangiectatic lesions in palms and soles , dysostosis multiplex and characteristic mri features of hypomyelination with gp and substantia nigra hypointensity in t2-weighted images and hyperintensity in t1 images with an undetectable fucosidase enzyme activity in leukocytes .
