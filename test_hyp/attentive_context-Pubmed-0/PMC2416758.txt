the purpose of the present study was evaluation of the effect of diazepam on explicit memory ( emotional and non - emotional tasks ) in patients with major depression who were not previously receiving benzodiazepines .
the enhancement of emotionally positive tasks in the diazepam group relative to the placebo group may suggest improvement of the retrieval of information by diazepam .
substantial evidence from animal and human subject studies converges on the view that memory for emotionally arousing events is modulated by an endogenous memory - modulating system consisting , at a minimum , of stress hormones and the amygdaloid complex . within the normal range of emotions experienced
improvement of retrieval by benzodiazepines has been observed ( izquierdo and chaves 1988 ; chaves et al 1990 ) , and it was hypothesized that the phenomenon would not be a true facilitation of retrieval processes , but the result of reduced interference from items presented after drug administration and thus a secondary consequence of drug - induced amnesia ( retroactive interference ) ( loftus and palmer 1974 ; chaves et al 1990 ) . because of the small sample size and the relatively large number of comparisons that were carried out , consideration of our results should take these limitations into account .
