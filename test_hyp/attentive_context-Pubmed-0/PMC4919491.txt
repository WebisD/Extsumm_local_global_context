the purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of this newly developed guided implant surgery system in partially edentulous patients using prospective clinical design and geometric analyses.2122
the present study confirms that the use of shank - modified drills and sleeve - incorporated stereolithographic templates is an effective way to improve the accuracy of implant placement by minimizing mechanical tolerance of the instruments .
the direct drill - guiding system in this study showed higher accuracy in implant placement by using shank - modified drills and a stereolithographic surgical guide that reduces the tolerance of surgical drills inside the guide sleeves . in a recent systematic review ,
the means and standard deviations of horizontal deviation were 0.593  0.238 mm in the mesiodistal direction and 0.691  0.344 mm in the buccolingual direction .
the mean vertical deviation was 0.925  0.376 mm in the occlusogingival direction , which was significantly larger than the horizontal deviations ( p = .018 ) .
the mean horizontal deviation of implant placement compared to the planned position was reported as 1.2 mm,23 whereas the direct drill - guiding system showed a mean deviation of 0.642 ; thus , this system is approximately twice as accurate as other systems in terms of horizontal linear deviation .
