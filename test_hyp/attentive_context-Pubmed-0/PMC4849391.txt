we describe an asymptomatic case of aneurysm of ica treated successfully by middle ear surgery .
aneurysms of the internal carotid artery ( ica ) in the middle ear are uncommon vascular anomalies   and are difficult to detect and treat
high resolution computed tomography angiography ( cta ) is the technique of choice and , in some cases , can be complemented with a magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) . in this article
aneurysms of the ica in the middle ear are rare and difficult to treat because the anatomy of the region and life threatening complications after surgery .
in that situation a patient may enter a critical condition following hemorrhagic shock or respiratory failure . in our case ,
a 50-year - old female was referred to the emergency room of ent department of cluj- napoca for massive left otorrhagia started a few hours before presentation .
otologists should be aware that symptoms and signs such as pulsatile tinnitus , conductive hearing loss , and a pulsatile retrotympanic mass in the anteroinferior part may be related to an ica aneurysm .
thus , ica aneurysm , which is asymptomatic most of the time , will be diagnosed during middle ear surgery or a routine otoscopy or complications like otorrhagia .
