eight cases of anterior tibial condyle fractures with posterior subluxation of the tibia , six of which were missed by the initial surgeon and two referred to us early , are described .
awareness that such an injury exists and suspecting it in a case with posterior subluxation of tibia , is the key to early diagnosis . once diagnosed , an evaluation by ct scan and reconstruction of the depressed anterior condyle from front , in addition to pcl reconstruction is required .
they should be suspected , diagnosed early and treated by reconstruction of anterior condyle , posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction .
these fractures are often missed on routine antero - posterior and lateral knee x - rays due to an overlap between the fracture and the normal bone .
were operated , the flexion deformity got corrected in all ( average from 15 to 0 ) and mean flexion achieved was 100 ( range : 80 - 120 ) . in those presenting early and were operated , there was no flexion deformity at 6 months and a mean flexion achieved was 115 ( range : 100 - 130 ) .
in most classifications of tibial plateau fractures , including one used most widely - schatzker classification , fractures are described as a combination of medial and lateral condyle , primarily in the sagittal plane .
