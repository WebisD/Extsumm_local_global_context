a 72-year - old patient who had undergone bilateral uneventful cataract surgery 6 years ago , presented with visual loss in her left eye .
as this is a report of unique case with short follow - up , it is very difficult to comment that mislocation of a dexamethasone intravitreal implant on an intact posterior capsule is an innocent complication .
patient had a medical history of multiple intravitreal and periocular steroid injections for the treatment of recalcitrant uveitis that was diagnosed 21 years ago .
it is mandatory to observe more cases with long follow - up in order to estimate possible side effects of ozurdex implant attached on the posterior capsule .
an unclear image of macular edema was hardly detected on flourescein angiography ( fa ) that revealed flue images of posterior - segment obscured by media opacity .
anterior migration of dexamethasone implant has also been published as a rare complication in the literature .
herein , we report the first case with anterior migration of a dexamethasone intravitreal implant that mislocated just behind the iol in an intact capsular bag . in the present case ,
a drop of 0.5% topical proparacaine hydrochloride with a drop of 5% povidone iodine was installed before the patient underwent an uncomplicated intravitreal dexamethasone implant application .
