in vivo experiments involving a mouse model of cervicovaginal toxicity provide support for the safe use of a gel formulation containing the biguanide - based antiviral compound nb325 as a topical vaginal microbicide .
however , indications of minor dose - dependent effects on epithelial integrity and regional differences in the effects of nb325 on the cervicovaginal tract indicate the need for further preclinical studies to arrive at an optimal api concentration and formulation .
the objectives of the present study were to assess the safety of nb325 formulated at two concentrations ( 0.5% and 1% ) and to investigate time - dependent effects of application on cervicovaginal integrity .
previous studies using this murine model of microbicide toxicity ( i ) confirmed the cervicovaginal toxicity and inflammation associated with topical application of nonoxynol-9 ( n-9 ) in women      and ( ii ) corroborated differences in acceptability between two different formulations of the microbicide api c31 g     . in previous mouse model experiments relevant to the present studies , in vivo exposure to unformulated 1% pehmb resulted in minimal epithelial damage and negligible local inflammation
experiments were focused on the acute time points of 10  min , 2  h , and 4  h postapplication , because these exposure durations were previously shown to provide important information for gauging acute epithelial toxicity following n-9 or c31 g exposure       .
