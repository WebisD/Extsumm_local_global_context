the 2003 medicare modernization act included several demonstration projects to assess the various approaches and inform medicare 's chronic dm strategy .
if the early trends are indicative of the final phase i results , policymakers should consider the changes that must be made to the commercial dm model to improve the likelihood of achieving cost savings and then assess whether the model is sufficiently compelling , when compared to other chronic care management strategies , to justify pursuing it .
review of the dm literature concluded that   there is insufficient evidence to conclude that disease management programs can generally reduce the overall cost of health care services .
as rising health care costs continue to draw attention , the rate of increase in medicare expenditures , which significantly exceeded those of the overall u.s . health care system ( 9.3 versus 6.9 percent in 2005 ) , is of particular concern to policymakers .
thus , to limit increases in overall program expenditures , congress is actively pursuing strategies to contain costs of the chronically ill subset of beneficiaries . with many approaches to chronic dm and little agreement on the most effective approach ,
thus , in light of the dm model flaws , achieving a 15-percent reduction in all - cause admissions or an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions is unlikely for the current programs .
