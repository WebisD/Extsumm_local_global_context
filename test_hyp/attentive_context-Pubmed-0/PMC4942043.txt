the ahdra was designed to ( i ) track severe disease within states and territories to better characterize the focal nature of the pandemic , ( ii ) track disease trends over brief periods of time to facilitate rapid public health responses to changes in ph1n1 epidemiology , and ( iii ) accommodate variation in local resources by providing a simple , flexible method that allowed reliable reporting by all states and territories without overwhelming health departments during the pandemic response . in this report
these systems track a variety of outcomes , including laboratoryconfirmed influenza hospitalizations , outpatient visits for influenzalike illness ( ili ) , pneumonia and influenzacoded deaths for all ages , pediatric laboratoryconfirmed deaths , and positive laboratory samples . 
  despite the utility of these existing systems , additional data to estimate disease severity and track illness at the state level were needed during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic , as timely and representative information describing 2009 pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) ( ph1n1 ) activity
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists ( cste ) established the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity ( ahdra ) as part of an overall national surveillance strategy implemented to collect timely and representative data describing ph1n1 infections in the united states .
