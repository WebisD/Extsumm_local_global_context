, the ror method provided the highest number of signals , while the ebgm method provided the lowest 23 . in the present study , the commonality of prr- , ror- , ic- , and
a signal indicates an association between a drug and an adverse event or drug - associated adverse event , including the proportional reporting ratio ( prr ) 12 , reporting odds ratio ( ror ) 13 , information component ( ic ) given by a bayesian confidence propagation neural network 14 , and empirical bayes geometric mean ( ebgm ) 15 .
associations with adverse events of interests were previously analyzed for 16 drugs using reports in the faers database between 2004 and 2009 16 - 22 . whether an adverse event is detected as a signal has been shown to depend on the algorithms ; however , of the 4 methods
the us food and drug administration ( fda ) adverse event reporting system ( faers , formerly aers ) is a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to the fda 1 - 3 . besides those from manufacturers
recently compared the timing of early signal detection with prr , ror , ic , and ebgm using the faers database , and concluded that the ror performed better 30 .
