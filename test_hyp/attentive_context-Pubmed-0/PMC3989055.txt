all harmful consequences of plastic contamination described in marine systems ( ranging from ingestion of plastic particles by a wide range of organisms to introduction of alien species which raft plastic litter ) may operate in rivers and lakes and deserve closer attention .
the whole study was embedded in a scientific project that highlights larval dispersal and the conservation of riverine fish populations .
there is rare information about land based litter sources and the  development and improvement of the existing monitoring system to provide comparable data sets for pollutant loads ( from direct discharges and river inputs )  is a high priority task of the  black sea strategic action plan 
we hope to serve the cause and help to strengthen the enforcement of national and international regulations on land - based pollution sources ( i.e. operation clean sweep , http://www.opcleansweep.org ) furthermore , our results shall give impetus to continuative studies on freshwater plastic pollution .
the main aim of the study was to categorize and to quantify drifting plastic items . in a second step
we compare plastic abundance and plastic mass in the river with those of ichthyoplankton ( drifting fish larvae and juveniles ) .
