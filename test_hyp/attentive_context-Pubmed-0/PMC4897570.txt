in conclusion , the result of this study shows that oral administration of the aqueous extract of p. ligularis reduces blood glucose , serum lipids which could be due to improvement in insulin secretion by recovery of pancreatic  cells .
this study was undertaken to find out antioxidant and antidiabetic potential in aqueous fruit extract of p. ligularis .
therefore , it is concluded that the aqueous extract of p. ligularis possesses antidiabetic activity and it may prove to be effective for the management of diabetes .
increase in serum protein , that is , the ratio of albumin and globulin in diabetic rats treated with aqueous extract of p. ligularis and standard drug , was observed .
250 , 500 , 1000 , and 2000  mg / kg of the aqueous extract of passiflora ligularis were administered orally to four groups of five animals each .
p. ligularis possesses antioxidant potential which may be used for therapeutic purposes mainly in the prevention of oxidative damage that occurs during diabetes .
the animals were divided into 5 groups ( n = 3 ) as follows :  group 1 : control rats ;  group 2 : diabetic control rats ;  group 3 : rats treated with 200  mg / kg of aqueous extract of fruit of p. ligularis ;  group 4 : rats treated with 400  mg / kg of aqueous extract of fruit of p. ligularis ;  group 5 : rats treated with 600  mg / kg of aqueous extract of fruit of p. ligularis .
