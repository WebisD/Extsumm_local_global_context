we present a case of rapid progression of ppa manifested as bilateral pulmonary opacities and haemothorax .
primary pulmonary angiosarcoma ( ppa ) is a rare neoplasm originating from endothelial cells of small vessels of the lung .
the presented case is a rare manifestation of primary pulmonary angiosarcoma with diffuse pulmonary haemorrhage and haemothorax .
non - distinctive clinical and radiological symptoms and a rapidly progressive course make this type of neoplasm a considerable challenge for clinicians . our case is a reminder of the necessity to include ppa in differential diagnosis of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and haemothorax .
diffuse alveolar haemorrhage with concomitant haemothorax is an extremely rare manifestation of primary angiosarcoma of the lung .
a 65-year - old smoking woman presented a four - month history of haemoptysis , cough , and dyspnoea .
the diagnosis is based on histological findings complemented by immunohistochemical stainings typical for endothelial markers .
chest computed tomography ( ct ) demonstrates solitary or multifocal lesions occasionally accompanied by ground - glass opacities or pleural effusion   .
nevertheless , due to nonspecific complaints , continuous anticoagulant therapy , history of heart disease , misleading radiological features , and rapid progression , the diagnosis was made in a very advanced and metastatic stadium . in the presented case
