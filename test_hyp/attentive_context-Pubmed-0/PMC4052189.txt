, we focus on fixational eye movements as presenting a continuous range from microsaccades to ( pathological ) square wave jerks ( swj ) . due to the particular role of eye movement alterations for the clinical and neuroscientific work - up of parkinsonian syndromes , we will focus on movement disorders in this synopsis to emphasize the significance in assessing eye movement control to understand the respective pathophysiology .
together , our aim is to condense both the oculomotor dysfunctions in patients with neurodegenerative movement disorders and the underlying pathological mechanisms that result in the observed dysfunctional oculomotor behavior . beyond the fact that oculomotor dysfunctions can be important for the purposes of clinical diagnosis , we discuss the potential functions and mechanisms of higher cortical contributions to eye movement control , in particular by reviewing broad pathological spectrum of cognitive control in functional system - related neurodegenerative conditions .
in the absence of definitive biomarkers , vog holds promise for a complementary noninvasive tool to characterize the oculomotor phenotype of distinct disease entities within the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases . in the course of neurodegenerative disorders ,
this review summarizes the fundamental mechanisms of eye movement control , considering healthy and pathological states of the brain .
