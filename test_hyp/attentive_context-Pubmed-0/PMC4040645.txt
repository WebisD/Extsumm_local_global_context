the pvp outcome in terms of postoperative back motion pain is worse for compression fractures at l4 or l5 compared with those treated at l3 level .
the patients with l5 ocf patients treated by pvp were more likely to have had previous pvp , and the patients with l4 or l5 ocf were more likely to be non - traumatic , presenting leg radiating symptoms and requiring an additional decompressive surgery more often than l3 ocf group .
we then reviewed the literatures to compare the surgical outcomes of patients with l4 or l5 compression fractures with those of patients with tlj level fractures .
between october 2008 and july 2012 , a total of 762 patients with 948 symptomatic ocfs were consecutively treated with pvp at our single institution .
therefore , the purpose of this present study is to provide accurate understanding of clinical presentations and surgical outcomes as well as to identify the unique characteristics of lower lumbar osteoporotic compression fracture ( ocf ) , which would enable physicians and patients to make more informed decisions about whether to perform the procedure and to develop more precise expectations of prognosis .
there were 5 patients who required the foraminal decompression surgery by paraspinal approach or fusion surgery during or after pvp in group 1 ( 2 patients with l4 ocf and 3 patients with l5 ocf ) , in which functional or economic status of 4 patients ( 80% ) was improved and 3 patients ( 60% ) showed leg radiating pain improvements on the long - term follow up interviews .
