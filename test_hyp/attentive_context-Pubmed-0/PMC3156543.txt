this case report reviews two such cases , while highlighting the anaesthesia related aspects of cs
cushing 's syndrome ( cs ) is a fairly common disease entity in endocrine outdoor and indoor departments .
thus , through our case studies , we concluded that cs presents a challenge to the anesthesiologist , who needs to deal with the volume overload , hyperglycemia , hypokalemia , difficult airway and ventilation .
hence , anaeathetists and surgeons should be made aware of the unique factors in cs which may impact perioperative health .
postoperatively , we must take care to supplement the cortisol ( guided by cortisol blood level ) , correct electrolyte level disturbances to maintain the hemodynamics , and keep the sugar blood levels in the normal range .
after discharge , she went on to develop the signs of cs as explained above . in cases of such unexplained fractures and osteopenia ,
after testing the serum cortisol and acth , and the dexamethasone suppression test , the diagnosis was confirmed .
this is the first demonstration that screening for cs may be feasible at the clinical onset of diabetes in an unselected cohort of patients .
our patients had unilateral adrenal hyperplasia with all the clinical features of cs , however , none of the above associations were seen .
