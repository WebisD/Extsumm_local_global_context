studies evaluating mortality and morbidity are ongoing and will provide further information on dual raas blockade with aliskiren . in summary , we demonstrate an antiproteinuric effect of dual raas blockade with aliskiren and irbesartan in combination compared with either treatment alone in patients with type 2 diabetes , hypertension , and albuminuria .
the relative difference between aliskiren and combination treatment was 31% . to adjust for treatment - induced changes in gfr and the potential influence on albuminuria reduction , we calculated fractional clearance , which was reduced by 46% versus placebo during aliskiren treatment ( p = 0.021 ) , by 56% versus placebo during irbesartan treatment ( p = 0.002 ) , and by 67% versus placebo during combination treatment ( p = 0.001 ) .
as opposed to the aliskiren in the evaluation of proteinuria in diabetes ( avoid ) study ( 5 ) , which showed an additional 20% albuminuria reduction after 24 weeks of treatment with aliskiren compared with placebo added to the maximal recommended dose of losartan and optimal antihypertensive therapy , this is the first study with a head - to - head comparison between aliskiren and irbesartan treatment .
the primary objective was to assess albuminuria during different treatments compared with that with placebo ; secondary objectives were to assess effect on 24-h blood pressure , glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) , biomarkers , and raas components .
