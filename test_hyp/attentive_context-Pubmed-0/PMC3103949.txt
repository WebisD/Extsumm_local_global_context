/ l are robust predictors of three month postoperative mortality in the elderly undergoing hip fracture surgery .
high plasma troponin levels have been associated with severe adverse outcomes and increased mortality   . in this study we wanted to test the hypothesis that fatal outcome following hip fracture
, this study showed that basic clinical information on sex , age and comorbidity ( asa score ) and a high postoperative plasma concentration of tnt > 0.04  g
high tnt plasma concentration was associated with increased mortality ( or 6.1 95% ci 623.1 , p  =  0.008 ) at day four after surgery .
1mean and 95% confidence intervals for troponin t , creatine kinase ( ck ) , myocardium - specific creatine kinase ( ck - mb ) and ratio of ck - mb to ck before surgery , perioperatively and 1 and 4  days after surgery for 3-month mortality . statistical significance ( p  <  0.05 ) between mortality groups is indicated by an asterisk .
/ l before surgery correlated with three month mortality [ odds ratio ( or ) 10.9 , 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 2.254.0 , p  =  0.003 ] ( table  2 ) .
