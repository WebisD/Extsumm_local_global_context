tg13 introduces a new standard for the diagnosis , severity grading and management of acute cholangitis . as compared with charcot s triad and tg07 , validity of the diagnostic criteria
this meeting resulted in the introduction of the new tokyo guidelines ( tg07 ) for diagnosis and severity assessment of acute cholangitis .
consequently , the tokyo guidelines revision committee was assembled and gathered a large number of cases of acute cholangitis from tertiary care centers in japan .
our approach in this study was to gather data from 794 patients who were considered to have had acute cholangitis based on one of the following three criteria : ( 1 ) presence of purulent biliary leakage ; ( 2 ) clinical remission due to bile duct drainage ; or ( 3 ) remission achieved by antimicrobial therapy alone in patients in whom the only site of infection was the biliary tree .
however , it remains a life - threatening disease and early determination of disease severity is essential to select appropriate therapy , particularly the timing of biliary decompression . in 2007
these criteria allow early diagnosis and severity grading of the disease and should be clinically useful in the management of this severe disease .
