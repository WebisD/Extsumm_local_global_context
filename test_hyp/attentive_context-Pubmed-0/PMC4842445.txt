therefore , the purpose of the present study was to 
 investigate the effect of hip external rotator strengthening and ts exercises in subjects 
 with pronated feet , and to evaluate their effects on lower extremity muscle activities 
 during stair - walking .
muscle 
 activity levels and joint angles at different time - points could not be identified during 
 motion , as the changes in muscle activity and the joint angles were evaluated together .
the present study was conducted to compare changes in lower extremity muscle activities 
 during stair - walking between subjects with flatfoot who performed only ts exercises and 
 subjects who additionally performed hip external rotator exercises , in order to present 
 basic evidence for exercise treatment . since many studies set the criterion for flatfoot as 
 10  mm or greater nd12,13,14 , the present study s 
 subjects were selected based on that criterion .   in the case of flatfoot
after the 4-week intervention , there was no significance 
 different between hip external rotator and ts exercise and only ts exercise ( table 3table 3.comparison of emg activities ( % mvc ) between the group that performed both hip
