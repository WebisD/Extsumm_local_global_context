body temperature reduction can be interpreted as an index of alteration of various central neurotransmitters ; anxiety and sedation are mainly mediated by the gaba - a receptor in the cns . since depressant action was confirmed specially for the methanolic extract , we decided to study whether the addition of this methanolic dry extract in cortical neurons culture could exert any influence on the secretion of the excitatory amino acids aspartate ( asp ) and glutamate ( glu ) , and the inhibitory amino acids gaba and glycine ( gly ) , as well as the presence of these amino acid neurotransmitters in the extract .
the results explain the sedative and depressive effects observed in vivo by an increase in inhibitory amino acids at the synaptic terminals .
, we observed a diminished liberation that could be justified by the previous loss of cellular gaba content as the neurons had been treated with the ns extract . in conclusion , this study suggests a sedative effect of ns methanolic extract by modification of neurotransmitter amino acids release , because the ns extract may induce an important release of gaba and gly in the cultured neurons medium and therefore , exert an increase in the agonist action over their receptors .
