we present an under - air staining technique of the anterior capsule using one drop of tb injected with a 30 g needle through the peripheral cornea .
moreover , it allows selective staining of the capsule using the needle and avoids an excessive buildup of tb in the anterior chamber .
, the use of the 30 g needle technique could be dangerous and should be avoided . in conclusion , in a small series of seven patients , the staining of the anterior capsule using tb under air with a 30 g needle allowed for enhanced stability of the anterior chamber and the use of the smallest quantity of dye .
the original technique of staining the anterior capsule with trypan blue ( tb ) in eyes with no red reflex involves the injection of the dye with a cannula after filling the anterior chamber with an air bubble.1 the stability of the anterior chamber can be compromised by air escaping when the cannula is introduced and the dye is injected .
several techniques using viscoelastic substances as an alternative to air have been presented to increase the stability of the anterior chamber.25 however , staining under viscoelastic material can be time - consuming and expensive , as it requires the mechanical spreading of tb onto the anterior capsule and the replacement of the viscous solution when an excessive diffusion of dye affects its transparency .
