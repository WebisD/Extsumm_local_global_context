the findings of the present study provide an essential validation of the t / f strategy , originally developed to identify transmitted hiv-1 genomes ( 36 , 38 , 39 , 62 , 63 ) , for hcv .
our results illustrate how t / f analysis in hcv infection , much like t / f analysis in hiv-1 infection , represents a novel experimental strategy that can be used to molecularly anchor and uniquely inform studies of hcv natural history , immunopathogenesis , treatment , and prevention .
current and future hcv vaccine trials ( 3 , 4 ) are primed to adopt this methodology and the associated bioinformatic and statistical platforms to accelerate hcv vaccine development and testing .
comparable studies in other flavivirus or alphavirus systems may similarly benefit from a precise molecular identification of t / f genomes and their early molecular pathways of diversification .
in the area of vaccine development , sgs has been uniquely informative and represents a major tool for assessing virus responses to host adaptive immunity in natural hiv-1 infection and following vaccination .
we tested two hypotheses : first , that hcv genomes responsible for transmission to a naive host can be identified unambiguously in paired donor - recipient plasma samples and that these sequences will be identical or nearly so , and second , that high - multiplicity infection of a subject with plasma from a donor who is acutely infected ( and thus harbors sequences exhibiting a pretransmission population bottleneck ) will recapitulate patterns of virus diversity observed in subjects 10003 , 10016 , and 10020 .
