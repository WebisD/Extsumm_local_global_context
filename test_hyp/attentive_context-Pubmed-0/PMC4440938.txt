, the idh1 mutation was found by both the pna clamping method and direct sequencing ( case no
using the pna clamping method , idh1/2 mutations were detected in three of the 61 patients ( 5% ) . of these three samples , two were idh1 mutants and one sample was an idh2 mutant . by direct sequencing , idh1/2 mutations were detected in two of the 61 patients ( 3% ) , of which , one sample was an idh1 mutant and one sample was an idh2 mutant . in total , four cases out of 61 ( 6% ) harbored idh1/2 mutations by at least one of the two methods employed , and the numbers of idh1 and idh2 mutants were equal ( table 1 ) .
. the overall concordance rate of both methods was over 95% ( 58 of 61 ) and the discordance rate was less than 5% ( 3 of 61 ) . in mutant cases ,
in one of four cases , examination by the pna clamping method showed equivocal results , but direct sequencing showed an idh2 mutation ( case no .
immunohistochemistry with antibody to dia - h09 in the four cases bearing idh1/2 mutations showed positive reactions only in case no .
