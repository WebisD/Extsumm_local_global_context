the present data reveal that task - irrelevant threat ( facial expressions of anger ) is associated with a power decrease in the gamma - band within 250 ms of stimulus onset in the occipital cortex ( in keeping with neural theories of visual processing of threat  e.g . , davis & whalen , 2001 ) . taken together with recent research into the role of gamma in information processing
, our research reveals , for angry faces at least , that gamma desynchrony , in addition to gamma synchrony , is key when considering neural networks associated with the perceptual processing of this threat cue .
the findings of this study support the hypotheses with ( 1 ) a significant power decrease for facial displays of anger compared to the neutral expressions in extrastriate cortex , including lingual gyrus , and ( 2 ) this decrease occurring approximately 100 ms post - stimulus onset ( i.e. , within the 50250 ms post - stimulus time window ) . moreover , as shown by the individual subject - level analyses , the power decrease in the gamma band for the angry stimuli was observed in ba 18 post - stimulus onset in all subjects .
