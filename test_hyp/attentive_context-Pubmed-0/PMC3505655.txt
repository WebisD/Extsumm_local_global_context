we successfully piloted implementation of the pep intervention in four breast screening services : we trained nhs mammographers who delivered the intervention confidently to a high standard , and who were positive about its effect on their professional development .
this suggests that at least 500 women in england will die because of delayed presentation each year ( assuming a 5-year breast cancer survival of 80% in women who delay <3 months and 73% in those who delay > 3 months ) .
delivered to all women attending for their final invited mammogram on the nhs breast screening programme , at whatever age that may be , the pep intervention could contribute to improving cancer survival in england so that it is nearer to that achieved in similar countries .
511 women were asked to participate in the evaluation of breast cancer awareness ; 495 ( 97% ) agreed to take part and completed a baseline questionnaire .
we have developed a brief intervention to promote early symptomatic presentation of breast cancer in older women ( the promoting early presentation ( pep ) intervention ) .
the effect of the intervention on breast cancer awareness in routine clinical practice is of a similar size as achieved by the pep intervention delivered within the randomised controlled trial , which increased breast cancer awareness at one month from 2% at baseline to 33% at one month .
