it combines the data - rich molecular biology content normally found in curated sequence databases such as swiss - prot and uniprot ( 6 ) with the equally rich data found in medicinal chemistry textbooks and chemical reference handbooks . by bringing these two disparate types of information together into one unified and freely available resource
, we wanted to allow educators and researchers from diverse disciplines and backgrounds ( academic , industrial , clinical , non - clinical ) to conduct the type of in silico learning and discovery that is now routine in the world of genomics and proteomics .
, this kind of database could potentially allow researchers to easily visualize and explore 3d drug interactions , compare drug similarities or perform in silico drug ( or drug target ) discovery . here
fundamentally , drugbank is a dual purpose bioinformatics  cheminformatics database with a strong focus on quantitative , analytic or molecular - scale information about both drugs and drug targets . in many respects

ideally , what is needed is something that combines the strengths of , say , pharmgkb , pubchem and swiss - prot to create a single , fully searchable in silico drug resource that links sequence , structure and mechanistic data about drug molecules ( including biotech drugs ) with sequence , structure and mechanistic data about their drug targets . beyond its obvious educational value
