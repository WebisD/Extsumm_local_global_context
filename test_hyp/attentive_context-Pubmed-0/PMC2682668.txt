neuron - specific alternate fuels may therefore provide a means of reducing the risk of hypoglycemia - induced brain injury in intensively treated diabetic patients .
other studies from our group have , in fact , demonstrated a threefold increase in gaba in hypothalamic interstitial fluid ( 31 ) and increased long - term potentiation in hippocampal slice preparations in rats exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia ( 32 ) .
bhb levels were the same in both groups , and brain levels were not detected , implying similar blood - to - brain concentration gradients  the driving force for bhb utilization in the brain .
in this study , we measured the rates at which glucose and an alternate fuel ( acetate ) is oxidized under different glycemic conditions .
although animals from both groups showed similar plasma glucose levels , exposure to antecedent recurrent hypoglycemia resulted in 34% higher brain glucose concentrations ( 1.27  0.04 and 1.72  0.08 mol / g for control and 3drh , respectively ; p = 0.002 ) , suggesting an increased glucose transport capacity in the 3drh group .
in summary , our study provides the first evidence that recurrent hypoglycemia increases neuronal glucose metabolism under euglycemia . under hypoglycemia ,
