the epidermal - mucosal changes of hyperparakeratosis , neutrophilic infiltrate and dermal - submucosal foam cell reaction are distinctive features of these xanthomas.8 hereby , we present a rare type of xanthomas calling  cauliflower xanthoma  in a 43-year - old man with dysbetalipoproteinaemia .
verruciform xanthoma usually presents as a hyperkeratotic , cauliflower like , verrucous or papillomatous lesion.6 it initially was described as a unique clinicopathologic lesion of the oral mucosa and was subsequently reported in the skin .
type iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia is a kind of lipid metabolism disorders , caused by apo - e deficiency , which leads to accumulation of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein remnants in the plasma.123 lipid metabolism disorders are mostly manifested by xanthomas , which are known as yellowish cholesterol - rich material in large foam cells accumulating in the skins and tendons.14 these yellowish lesions may appear all over the body , on the palm of the hands , sole of the foot , tendons , and even on the eyelids.5 these lesions firstly described with or without hyperlipidaemia in association with monoclonal immunoglobulin . based on this fact , there are three forms of xanthoma : hyperlipaemic xanthoma , normolipaemic xanthoma and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.6 xanthomatosis is usually associated with hyperlipidaemia , and morbidity and mortality of this condition are related to atherosclerosis and pancreatitis.7 hyperlipaemic xanthoma lesions are more polymorphic and can include tuberous , tendinous , palmar or eruptive xanthoma .
