moreover , these nanosystem formulations present the following improvements : higher stability for all chlorhexidine inclusion complexes compared with pure chlorhexidine under 40c  2c and 75%  5% rh and being a sustained release system , the potential for nys nanosystems to mask the bitter taste , justifying subsequent in - vivo studies . for these reasons ,
the aim of this study is the development of new nano - structured drug - delivery systems with industrial applicability containing classical drugs for control of buccal pathologies , nys and chx , in order to increase the drug stability and improve the taste and antimicrobial action .
prepared and tested were inclusion complexes of nys and chx with mmtna , and chx with cd and two derivatives , mcd and hpcd .
xrpd , ftir , and dsc analysis were used to confirm the proposed nanosystems formation and the suitability of the production methods . however , the nanosystems that showed best antimicrobial effect were chx and cd inclusion complexes and chx : mmtna 60% cec  24 hours .
these samples were stored in a climatic chamber at 45c  2c and 75%  5% relative humidity ( rh ) in order to evaluate the thermal stability .
