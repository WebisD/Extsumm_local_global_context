the purpose of the current study , was to investigate which type of well - known mathematical distribution fitted to the ielt distribution of men with lifelong pe and of men in the general male population .
the ielt distribution of men in the general population is most accurately fitted by the lognormal distribution , whereas the ielt distribution of men with lifelong pe is most accurately fitted by the gumbel max distribution .
as there are significantly more men with lifelong pe who ejaculate within 30 and 60 seconds than can be extrapolated from the probability density curve of the ielt distribution of men in the general population it is concluded that men with lifelong pe have a distinct ielt distribution that can only be retrieved from the general male population ielt distribution when thousands of men would participate in a stopwatch study of the ielt .
1a , b ) and of the ielt data of a previous stopwatch study in a clinical cohort of men with lifelong premature ejaculation ( fig .
in addition , in a meta - analysis of all drug treatment studies of premature ejaculation from 1943 to 2003 , it was shown that prospective real - time stopwatch measurement of the ielt during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssri ) treatment led to a smaller , and therefore more valid , confidence interval of the ielt compared to retrospective questionnaire studies of the ielt . in 2005 ,
