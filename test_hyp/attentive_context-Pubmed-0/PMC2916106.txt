a 39-year - old man visited our clinic with a 2-week history of whitening of the eyelashes of his left lower lid .
, we herein present a case of a halo nevus with poliosis of the eyelashes as the only sign of the halo phenomenon .
a halo nevus without the halo phenomenon is very rare and can only be diagnosed by histology .
it is not possible for us to state with certainty why this may have occurred in the setting of a halo nevus undergoing regression , although it is very likely that the inflammation resulted from an exaggerated cell - mediated immune response . in conclusion
the majorities of halo nevi are acquired compound melanocytic nevi and appear in childhood and early adolescence . the site of predilection is the trunk and the back , especially when there are multiple lesions . patients with halo melanocytic nevi usually seek medical attention when their pigmented lesions develop a rim of depigmentation . over time ,
the underlying pathophysiology of the halo phenomenon is not well understood , but may possibly be the result of an immune response leading to nevus cell destruction .
further analysis is needed to elucidate the mechanism of spontaneous regression of a halo nevus without depigmentation .
