demographic characteristics of the studied patients and adherence to statin therapy ldl cholesterol goal attainment and related factors in this study , patients with adherence 80% had lower total and ldl cholesterol than those with adherence < 80% ( p < 0.01 ) .
moreover , adherent patients reached therapeutic goal significantly more than those who were considered non - adherence to statin therapy ( p < 0.01 ) .
to address these issues , we conducted a study to evaluate the adequacy of diabetic patients adherence to statin therapy for lipid management in a research based community clinic in iran .
the mean of mpr of statins during 3 months was 0.89  0.24 and pearson correlation showed the weak inverse relationship between mpr and ldl cholesterol , however this was not statistically significant ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.08 ) .
follow - up chart of the studied patients overall , 20.3% ( n = 32 ) of patients were considered nonadherent to statin therapy and only 31.6% ( n = 50 ) of patients achieved their ldl cholesterol goal < 100 mg / dl .
non - adherence to statins seems to be a significant issue in health care system for diabetic patients in iran .
