we hypothesized that patients with first - episode schizophrenia and their non - psychotic fdrs would show a reduced dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex and smc while performing the fep task .
in this study , we report for the first time the neural activation and connectivity elicited by execution of the fep task in patients with first episode schizophrenia and their healthy first degree relatives .
our main finding is that patients with first episode schizophrenia do not show , in comparison with healthy controls and their fdrs , activation of the left middle frontal gyrus in the execution of the fep versus a simpler motor task like the pt .
, we examined whether prefrontal regions are involved in the integration or regulation of neural activity underlying motor sequencing in patients with first - episode schizophrenia and their non - psychotic first degree relatives ( fdr ) .
more specifically , we aimed to identify any frontal regions where coupling in these areas and the sensorimotor cortex ( smc ) significantly differed between the complex fep task and a simple control motor task using ppi analysis .
a frontal dysfunction was also demonstrated by our second main finding , suggesting that with increase in task difficulty , patients with first episode schizophrenia do not show functional connectivity between the sensorimotor cortex and the right frontal gyrus , in contrast to healthy controls .
