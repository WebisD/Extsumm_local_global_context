in summary , we have developed the nickel - catalyzed , 
 stereospecific 
 ring - opening cross - coupling reactions of aryl - substituted tetrahydrofurans , 
 tetrahydropyrans , and lactones . through judicious choice of starting 
 materials , cyclic ether intermediates have been utilized to set the 
 desired relative stereochemical relationships and allow for the selective 
 synthesis of syn- and anti- deoxypropionate 
 subunits .
we report 
 the two - step , enantiospecific synthesis of an anti - dyslipidemia agent 
 with easy access to either enantiomer .
the negishi - type cross - coupling of benzylic lactones has allowed for 
 the enantiospecific synthesis of enantioenriched carboxylic acids , 
 which can be further derivatized . using this methodology ,
in addition , strategic use of extended alkyl 
 or aryl grignard reagents would allow for the generation of a wide 
 range of unnatural polyketide analogs for biological testing . in this 
 manuscript ,
we have demonstrated the high stereospecificity of the reaction , 
 where the dr of the product matches the dr of the starting o - heterocycles . 

the discovery and asymmetric 
 synthesis of novel polyketides and 
 their unnatural analogs fuel the development of new therapeutic agents . 

the structural complexity of this class of molecules has inspired 
 and tested synthetic organic chemistry .
