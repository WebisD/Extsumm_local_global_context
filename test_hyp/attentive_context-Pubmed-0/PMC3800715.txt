when surgical repair of the brachial plexus and spinal cord stimulation are not available , percutaneous t2 and t3 rf sympathectomy could be considered in patients with type ii crps .
this case series illustrates the success of percutaneous t2 and t3 rf sympathectomy via the multimodal approach to chronic pain management in controlling the pain suffered by patients with crps secondary to brachial plexus injury .
a total of 5 patients were identified , but only 4 patients agreed to undergo t2 and t3 rf sympathectomy after receiving an explanation of the risks and benefits of the procedure .
after the second rf sympathectomy , patient 1 experienced a pain relief effect similar to that of the previous procedure .
all of the study patients underwent only one rf sympathectomy , except for patient 1 , who underwent another rf sympathectomy 9 months later .
thus , although sympathectomy might result in a significant reduction in pain , it would not completely eradicate all of the pain , as observed in the present study .
considerable anatomical variation in the sympathetic supply to the upper limb has been observed , which may explain the high incidence of recurrence of pain in the upper limb after thoracic sympathectomy .
