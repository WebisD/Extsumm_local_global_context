thus , this study examined the signaling pathway linking parp1 activation to autophagy under pharmaceutical stress , as well as the functional role of autophagy in pharmaceutical stress - mediated cell death .
this study was the first to demonstrate a novel function of parp1 in the regulation of as- and ps - induced autophagy via the parp1-ampk - mtor signaling pathway and that such autophagy serves as a cell survival mechanism against as - mediated necrosis , although it is insufficient to prevent necrosis - induced cell death ( figure 8) .
we used the mouse nit-1 insulinoma cell line as a pancreatic -cell model , which is an effective tool for analyzing -cell function and apoptosis   . to examine whether statins mediate the outcome of nit-1 cells , we used chemical inhibitor reagents to inhibit the expression of the target gene in nit-1 cells .
these findings contribute to the understanding of the complex relationship among statin - related diabetes , autophagy , and cell death .
consistent with these findings , our results revealed that the activation of ampk leads to the suppression of mtor and induction of autophagy in nit-1 cells exposed to as and ps . moreover , this study clearly suggested that autophagy is a cell survival mechanism in as- and ps - mediated cell death , based on the suppression of autophagy caused by baf - a1 . by contrast , the activation of autophagy caused by rapamycin protected the as- and ps - mediated cell death .
