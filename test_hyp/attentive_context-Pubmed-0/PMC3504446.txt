the purpose of our study was to observe the expression of paf and tnf- in seminal plasma of patients with leukocytospermia .
wbc count in leukocytospermia group was ( 1.33  0.18 )  10/ml , and tnf- concentration was ( 5.51  1.46  ng / ml ) , which was significantly higher than that of normal group wbc ( 0.43  0.19 )  10/ml and tnf- ( 3.48  1.08  ng / ml ) , and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.01 ) ( table 2 ) .   in this group , paf has no significant correlation with sperm density and liquefaction time . and what 's more , it has positive correlation with sperm survival rate ( r = 0.452 , p < 0.01 ) and sperm vigor ( r = 0.642 , p < 0.01 ) .  
paf concentration in leukocytospermia group was ( 2.14  0.43  ng / ml ) , which was significantly lower than the normal group ( 6.21  1.38  ng / ml ) ; the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.01 ) .
significant difference was found in the aspects of sperm survival rate and vigor between leukocytospermia group and normal group , p < 0.01 , while the difference in sperm density and liquefaction time was not obvious , p > 0.01 ( table 1 ) .
