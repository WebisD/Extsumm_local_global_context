we have observed a case of renal involvement complicated by granular corneal dystrophy type ii ( gcd2 ) .
we believe that our study was a type of oculorenal syndrome associated with a tgfbi mutation , which remains to be acknowledged .
we have reported the first case of a unique nephropathy complicated by tgfbi - related cd .
gcd2 , also known as avellino corneal dystrophy ( cd ) , is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the transforming growth factor--induced ( tgfbi ) gene .
further reports should be accumulated to determine whether the incidence of renal diseases associated with this mutation may presently be more frequent .
presently , alut testing is beneficial for laser - assisted in situ keratomileusis to protect patients from accelerated vision loss . as demonstrated with our patient , this test is easy and safe to perform when diagnosing patients with nephropathy associated with tgfbi mutations . in conclusion ,
patients with tgfbi - related cds , including gcd2 , should be examined for renal abnormalities .
this mutation can be found in several distinct autosomal dominant genetically determined cases of cd ; however , it is not known whether this mutation produces other clinical manifestations other than cd .
