these experiments have showed that msc - cm enhances both the rate of endothelial cell migration and the adherence of these cells to their culture surface , and that this effect was , in part , mediated by the presence of fibronectin .
we recently demonstrated that human msc - conditioned medium ( msc - cm ) was stimulatory to epidermal and fibroblast cell adherence and migration .
the effects of msc - cm upon endothelial cell migration were not entirely induced by fibronectin , as suggested by the further enhancement of eahy-926 endothelial cell migration by msc - cm in the presence of exogenous fibronectin .
further , we have identified extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins that are secreted by mscs using maldi / tof - tof mass spectrometry .
we have previously shown that msc - cm promotes the migration of skin cells in a wound healing model , and identified numerous potentially beneficial factors that may contribute to this effect .
overall , the data presented here support the hypothesis that msc may stimulate the formation of new vasculature , and that this may be an important aspect of msc - mediated enhancement of wound healing .
