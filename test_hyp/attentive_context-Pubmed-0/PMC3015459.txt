vibrational spectroscopy ( mid infrared and raman ) and x - ray diffractometry ( powder and single crystal ) were employed to determine the structural features of the phases . however , as neither high - throughput methodologies or other widely applied screening strategies(19 ) guarantee all possible forms will be found , we supported and complemented our manual screen with computational crystal structure prediction ( csp ) . by contrasting the thermodynamically feasible crystal structures with the experimentally observed ones , we discuss the factors that control crystallization and polymorphism of ra .
. therefore , our investigation aimed at an efficient screening program , using an experimental and computational(16 ) approach to complement and validate the results and comprehensively characterize all ra solid - state forms at ambient conditions . the experimental screen was based on manual solution crystallizations of the compound in a variety of solvents and crystallization conditions , sublimation and moisture sorption experiments . the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the solid - state forms were ascertained by hot - stage microscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , thermogravimetic analysis , and solvent - mediated transformation studies .
therefore , our results for -resorcylic acid emphasize the problems of determining the complete set of solid - state forms when there is evidence of disorder or short - lived intermediate crystallization products whose lifetime is very dependent on conditions .
