the emg signal amplitude ( % mvic ) of ut increased significantly ( mean  sd , 50.87  8.92 
 compared to 39.79  7.08 ) when wearing a brassiere compared to the no brassiere condition in 
 the females with ut region pain ( p < 0.05 ) .
therefore , the 
 purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of wearing a brassiere on ut region 
 pain and muscle activity during arm elevation by women .
wearing a 
 brassiere can increase ut muscle activity , so clinicians should consider recommending 
 brassiere removal for as long as possible , or suggest wearing a well - fitting and supportive 
 brassiere when managing women with upper trapezius region pain .
the ut pressure pain did not differ between 
 two conditions ( p > 0.05 ) .
fourteen female with ut region pain aged 25 to 47  years volunteered for this study . 

the pressure pain and emg activity were measured with and without wearing of a brassiere in 
 a randomized order .
emg data were collected from the right side ut muscle ( approximately half the distance 
 between the seventh cervical spinal process and the acromion ) .
inclusion criteria were history of ut region pain for at least 6 weeks and a visual analog 
 scale ( vas ) score > 5 ( severe pain ) at rest .
