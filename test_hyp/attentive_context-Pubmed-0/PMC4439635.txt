it is easy and less time - consuming to use , and esthetically it blends well with the adjacent tissue ; and multiple sites can be treated in a single visit . therefore , the case study was undertaken to clinically evaluate the use of an acellular dermal matrix allograft ( alloderm ) to increase the width of attached gingiva and to evaluate stability of the gained attached gingival tissue .
viewed subjectively , the sites showed better esthetics and blended with the surrounding tissue and caused less postoperative pain .
in this case study , an acellular dermal matrix ( alloderm ) was used to increase the width of attached gingiva at sites with < 1 mm of attached gingiva . for years
all of these three parameters show a consistent decrease in value in all patients , which indicates improved oral hygiene by the patients after the grafting procedure .
a total of 5 patients of which 3 were males and 2 were females in the age range of 2060 years were selected from out - patients of the department of periodontology , bapuji dental college and hospital , davangere .
complete keratinization of the newly formed attached tissue was observed at the end of 12 weeks [ figure 8 ] and was maintained for 9-month [ figure 10 ] . in all cases
