seventy - eight percent of the patients who participated in the study and perceived that the encounter had made it possible to cope with the illness were satisfied with their encounter ( table 2 ) . a good majority of the patients perceived that their ability to cope with the illness after the visit influenced the patients ' satisfaction with the encounter ( p < 0.001 ) .   
the patient 's assessment of time spent in the consultation was shown to have a statistically significant influence on the patients satisfaction with the consultation ( p < 0.001 ) .
three hundred and fifty ( 81% ) of patients who found an improvement in their ability to maintain their health were satisfied ( table 2 ) with their encounter ( p < 0.001 ) .  

this study comes from a background where patient awareness of their opportunities in the patient doctor encounter is still in its early days , and thus this study brings to the literature a unique perspective of the patients ' views from this environment .
this study sought to identify the factors contributing to patients ' satisfaction , shed more light on the burden of patients ' dissatisfaction with the consultation in our environment , and help devise strategies for practicing physicians to strive for an improvement in the overall patient care in our cultural context .
