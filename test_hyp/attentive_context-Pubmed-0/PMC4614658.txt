the first child was diagnosed at the age of 3  years , the second was monitored antenatally with repeated doppler ultrasound and was eventually treated for fetal anemia with repeated intrauterine transfusions . to our knowledge , this is the first case of prenatal diagnosis of gpi deficiency in cord blood , followed by successful intrauterine treatment of gpi - deficient fetal anemia .
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase ( gpi ) deficiency is the third most common red blood cell enzymopathy , after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) and pyruvate kinase ( pk ) deficiency and is similarly associated with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( hnsha ) .
, we describe a family in which two siblings have congenital hsnha due to gpi deficiency .
we recommend frequent ultrasound monitoring for prenatal management of pregnancies in which there is an increased risk of fetal gpi deficiency , when parents decline early invasive testing . in this case , repeated intrauterine blood transfusions appeared to be effective for the treatment of severe fetal anemia due to gpi deficiency and may additionally have prevented the development of fetal hydrops and demise .
a 33-year - old woman was referred to our center at 17  weeks of gestation because of an increased risk of fetal anemia .
