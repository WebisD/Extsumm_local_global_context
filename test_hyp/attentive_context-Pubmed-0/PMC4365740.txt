it is a non - neurolytic lesioning method for pain relief and can relieve pain without evidence of neural damage.7,8 in the present prospective , nonrandomized , open - label study , we attempt to compare the efficacy of prf relative to conservative management for chronic hip pain .
the present study compared prf with conservative treatment and demonstrates that at 1 week , 4 weeks , and 12 weeks after treatment initiation , improvements in pain are significantly greater with prf .
patients suffering from chronic hip pain for > 3 months with radiographic osteoarthritis of the hip ( tnnis grades i and ii ) were approached for this study .
six ( 75% ) of them had an improvement of > 50% with the pain , whereas two patients ( 25% ) had no improvement .
the pain medication scores were significantly lower in the prf group at 1 week ( p=0.01 ) , 4 weeks ( p=0.007 ) , and 12 weeks ( p=0.01 ) .
prf of the articular branches of the femoral and obturator nerves offers a treatment option with good outcomes for patients suffering from chronic hip pain .
the vas scores in the prf group were signifi - cantly lower than those in the conservative group at 1 week ( p<0.001 ) , 4 weeks ( p<0.001 ) , and 12 weeks ( p=0.017 ) .
