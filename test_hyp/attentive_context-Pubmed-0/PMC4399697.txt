the goals of this manuscript were to review the main indications for baha , analyze the audiometric results and benefits provided to patients compared with other treatment modalities ( e.g. , concomitant reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery ) , and compare the data from the literature with our sample of 13 patients who underwent this procedure between 2000 and 2009 .
the present review indicated that baha can be an excellent treatment option for patients with bilateral conductive deafness , as the literature has already established , due to its good hearing results , relative simplicity , and low rate of complications .
the bone - anchored hearing aid ( baha ) is a bone - integrated implant that was introduced in clinical practice in sweden in the 1970s1 .
it is indicated mostly for patients with conductive hearing loss resulting from the closure of the external ear canal and other malformations of the middle and external ear ; however , it can also be performed in patients with surgical mastoid cavities or those who do not adapt to conventional hearing aids .
electronic databases ( pubmed , medline , ovid , and cochrane ) were searched for works in english , spanish and portuguese , with no limitations for year in which procedures were performed .
