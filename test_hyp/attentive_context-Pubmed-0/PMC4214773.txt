after hyping  deep - etch  electron microscopy ( em ) for my whole career ( heuser , 2011 ) , i 'll take this invitation to write an ascb award essay to talk it up some more !
deep - etch em is a variant of what moor introduced ( heuser and salpeter , 1979 ) and deserves special attention only because its purpose has been to avoid all of the fixation and staining and dehydrating procedures that had accompanied previous approaches to em and essentially to get living cells replicated after they were frozen ( figure 1 ) .
george palade was my greatest hero , and his fun explanation in his nobel lecture of why he chose to study the pancreatic acinar cell is my favorite quote :  perhaps the most important factor in this choice was the appeal of the amazing organization of the pancreatic acinar cell , whose cytoplasm is packed with stacked er cisternae studded with ribosomes .
i used to wait with eager anticipation for each new issue of the journal of cell biology to arrive in the mail and then would devote a whole evening ( maybe with a glass of wine ) to carefully examining every new electron micrograph published that month .
