it is considered that the benefit / risk balance for the use of panitumumab in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer remains favorable also in japan .
the main objective of the current post - marketing surveillance study was to evaluate the safety of panitumumab in japanese patients with unresectable colorectal cancer ( and with the majority of patients possessing wild - type kras tumors ) in clinical practice .
this post - marketing surveillance study was planned to include all patients treated with panitumumab from the start date ( 15 june 2010 ) of its launch in japan . to promote the appropriate use and evaluate safety information , a vectibix appropriate use committee , a vectibix safety evaluation committee and a vectibix interstitial lung disease ( ild ) review subcommittee
however , because the number of japanese individuals enrolled in the global clinical trials was relatively limited ( 13 ) , the japanese ministry of health , labour and welfare required the market authorization holders to conduct a post - marketing surveillance study , called all cases surveillance ( 18 ) , as a condition of its approval to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of all japanese patients treated with panitumumab . the main purpose of this study was to collect detailed information , particularly with regard to safety issues , on all panitumumab - treated patients ; additionally , by evaluating a large number of patients , the study aimed to identify rare adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) , which are often undetectable in smaller clinical trials .
