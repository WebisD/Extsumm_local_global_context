doubtless , video laryngoscopy is a helpful tool in the hands of experienced physicians , but should not be considered a bailout procedure for beginners in airway management . and
in recent years , video - assisted intubation devices have flooded theaters , and , to a lesser extent , are also being used in icus . but can such new technology really contribute to making tracheal intubation in the icu less life - threatening , or even more life - saving ? noppens and colleagues , in a study just published in critical care , evaluated the efficacy of the c - mac video laryngoscope   for endotracheal intubation in an icu managed by anesthesiologists and compared the results to those obtained during a previous period when conventional direct laryngoscopy was used . in patients with at least one predictor for difficult intubation , poor glottic views ( cormack and lehane grades iii and iv )
as attractive and simple video laryngoscopy appears , we must always remind ourselves to maintain our skills in endoscopic intubation .
apart from the primary aim of the study - evaluating video laryngoscopy - it needs to be highlighted that noppens and colleagues   routinely used capnography to verify correct tube placement after intubation . capnography has become a mandatory requirement in any operating room , but its use in the icu seems still to be somewhat dowdy . as of 2010 , only 25% of icus in the uk and the republic of ireland used capnography to confirm correct tube placement after intubation . such refusal may produce catastrophic outcomes : data collected from all uk national health service hospitals over a period of one year in 2008/2009 revealed that 61% of adverse events during airway management in the icu resulted in death or permanent brain damage . in 74% of such fatal cases no capnography was used !
