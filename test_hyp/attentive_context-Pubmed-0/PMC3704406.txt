we therefore sought to further investigate the spread of various volumes of contrast injected under ultrasound guidance into the tap layer as identified by computed tomography ( ct ) imaging .
therefore , further in vivo studies are warranted to investigate the minimum volume of ultrasound - guided injectate required to cause a sensory blockade of the anterior abdominal wall .
anterior - posterior and transverse spread of injected contrast did not correlate with increasing volumes of contrast ( table 1 ) .
furthermore , the degree of injectate spread may be different for live patients compared with that in fresh cadavers , and in addition , may also vary according to variability of patient height , weight , and previous abdominal surgeries .
caudal spread of injected contrast correlated with increasing volumes of injectate ( table 1 ) .
contrast injected under ultrasound guidance was identified in the tap in both cadavers on ct imaging ( figure 2 and 3 ) .
as described in prior studies , there exists a difference in spread when a tap block is performed under ultrasound guidance , versus a nonguided approach to the triangle of petit.13 we chose to perform the injection using ultrasound guidance , with the goal of accurately measuring injectate spread delivered reliably into the transversus abdominis fascial plane .
