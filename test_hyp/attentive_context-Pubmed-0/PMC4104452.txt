cancer vaccine concept have been encompasses a broad spectrum of platforms intended to trigger or increase an adaptive immune response against a malignant tumor .
understanding of relationship between structure and function in cancer vaccines is essential to interpret their opportunities to impact into prolonging survival and increasing quality of life in cancer patients .
this review is aimed to focus on nsclc as an emerging and promising model for active immunotherapy and the challenges for its inclusion in the current clinical scenario ,   considering the increasing body of evidences of the interaction between inflammatory cells and tumor cells , facilitating the lung carcinogenesis and tumor hallmarks expression ( angiogenesis and tumor cell migration among others ) , in which antigen - specific antitumor responses are overtly present . in this context
today this cascade of clinical endpoints is the backbone for active immunization assessment and moreover the concept of cancer vaccines , applied in the nsclc setting , is just evolving as a complex therapeutic strategy , in which the opportunities for cancer vaccines start from the selection of the target cancer hallmark , followed by the vaccine formulation and its platforms for immune potentiating , also encompass the successful insertion in the standard of care , the chronic administration beyond progression disease , the personalization based on predictors of response and the potential combination with other targeted therapies .
