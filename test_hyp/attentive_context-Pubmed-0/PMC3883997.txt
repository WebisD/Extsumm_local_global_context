thus , the fetal and early postnatal periods appear to be a critical time for the enrichment of the adipocyte precursor pool and to accomplish functional adjustments . to improve understanding of effects of maternal suboptimal nutrition on adipose tissue function , we examined the impact of moderate maternal nutrient reduction ( mnr ) on in vitro adipocyte differentiation in adipose - derived stromal - vascular cells ( ascs ) from omental , subcutaneous abdominal and femoral adipose tissue depots in control normally grown baboon fetuses ( ctr ) of well - nourished mothers and fetuses of mothers fed 70% global diet of ctr from 30 d pregnancy to term ( mnr ) , a nutrient challenge that leads to intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr )   and a pre - diabetic phenotype by puberty .
although the maternal diet and depot each had no effect on the gene expression of terminal adipogenic genes , we found a significant interaction between diet and the fetal sex ( figure 1 ) ; i.e. maternal suboptimal nutrition increased the expression of adipogenesis - related genes in male but not female fetuses . specifically , while expression of adipogenic genes in ctr female and male fetuses was similar , expression of the classical adipogenic transcription factor ppar and its targets fabp4 , adiponectin , and to a remarkable degree ucp1 was higher in male mnr compared to female fetuses ( figure 1 ) .
