this remains an interesting and a yet to be fully explored option in terms of treatment for synovial inflammation .
in the study of inflammation and our efforts to promote its normal resolution , m remain to the fore of our interest . in the inflamed joint
macrophages ( m ) are one of the resident cell types in synovial tissue , along with fibroblasts . while quiescent in health , m become activated in the inflamed joint , where they make up around 3040% of the cellular content , and regulate secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines and enzymes involved in driving the inflammatory response and joint destruction ( firestein and zvaifler , 1990 ) . their position throughout the sub - lining layer and lining layer at the cartilage 
, m will continue to be a focal point for therapeutic intervention which , currently , centers around cytokine blockade but now has the possibility of extending into m re - programming .
it is estimated that rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) and psoriatic arthritis ( psa ) each affects approximately 1% of the population ( firestein , 2003 ; gladman , 2009 ) , leading to patient pain and disability as well as contributing to a great economic burden in terms of lost working days and patient health services ( cooper , 2000 ) and therefore is an area of intense investigation . as our understanding of inflammation progresses , including the recent concept that resolution of inflammation is an active process rather than a passive return to homeostasis , the role of m is increasingly appreciated .
