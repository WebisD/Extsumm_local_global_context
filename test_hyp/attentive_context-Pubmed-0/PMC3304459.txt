compared to immunotherapy strategies with monoclonal antibodies or with immunodominant peptides , vaccination with mva encoding a tumor antigen presents the advantage of raising an immune response against the whole antigen . in the context of a mva vaccination ,
vaccination with a membrane - bound form of a self - antigen , combined with other strategies , involving stimulation with cytokines ( il2 , il12 , gm - csf )   could represent a promising strategy to enhance immunogenicity in the context of mva vaccination .
, we compare the immune response elicited by the vaccination with a recombinant mva vector encoding the afp antigen either in its native secreted form or in modified membrane - associated or intracellular forms .
previously , vaccination with an mva encoding a modified membrane - associated form of the epithelial tumor antigen h23 , aberrantly expressed in breast cancer , has been shown to allow the production of elevated levels of specific antibodies in vaccinated animals   .
, we assessed the ability of mva to induce an immune response against the self - antigen -fetoprotein ( afp ) , and we compared the immunogenicity of different forms of this antigen after vaccination in nave mice .
