these observations led us to the hypothesis that , as with obesity - associated fatty liver , obesity would cause upregulation of facilitated long - chain fatty acid ( lcfa ) uptake by cardiomyocytes , leading to ectopic triglyceride accumulation in the heart and a consequent cardiomyopathy . to test that hypothesis , we examined three murine obesity models : c57bl/6j mice chronically fed a high - fat diet , leptin - deficient ob / ob mice , and leptin - receptor - deficient db / db mice , with a combination of functional , histologic , biochemical , and molecular studies .
facilitated uptake of long - chain fatty acids ( lcfa ) by cardiomyocytes , heart weights and left ventricular mass , and cardiac triglyceride content were increased and cardiac ejection fractions decreased in all three models .
the average body weights of our hfd - fed , db / db , and ob / ob mice were 1.3 , 1.9 and 2.3 times those of control animals , corresponding very roughly in human terms to obesity , morbid obesity , and super obesity , respectively , and all had hepatic steatosis .
nevertheless , the many similarities between the present cardiac findings in mice and analogous human data suggest that these mice may be useful models for human obesity cardiomyopathy , particularly given the limitations in obtaining human cardiac tissue for study . moreover , the correlations we observed between body weight , myocardial lipid accumulation , and decreased lv function , over a weight spectrum ranging from normal to super obesity , suggest that the recent observations of myocardial dysfunction in severely obese patients may be the tip of a much larger iceberg .
