we present a rare case of a patient presented to the emergency department of our hospital with symptoms of earache and sore throat for cardiac ischemia .
chest pain is a typical symptom of acute coronary syndrome ( acs ) , of which there are three common types : unstable angina ( ua ) , st segment elevation ( stemi ) of myocardial infarction ( mi ) , and non - st - segment elevation of mi ( nstemi )   .
a 53-year - old african - american female presented to the ed complaining of earache and sore throat for 3  days .
ear pain and sore throat are rare symptoms of acs , which makes diagnosis and treatment difficult and challenging .
we found only one report ; in this report the correct diagnosis of cardiac ischemia was missed in two patients who were initially treated for primary ear pain . in conclusion , clinicians should be aware and recognize that ear and throat pain may represent symptoms for cardiac ischemia .
symptoms of ear pain for cad and acute arterial occlusion in a patient have rarely been discussed in the literature .
we concluded on follow - up that otalgia in this patient was an atypical symptom of referred angina pain .
