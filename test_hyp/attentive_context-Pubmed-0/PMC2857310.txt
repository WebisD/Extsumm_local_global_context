the 2 cases of infection with mokv we report are the first in 8 years 
                 from south africa .
. a better understanding of the epidemiology of these 
                 viruses is vital and can only be achieved by improved surveillance and 
             awareness .
infections with mokv are rare ; only 23 isolates are known . during the past 2 decades , 
                
together with recent isolations of rabies - related lyssaviruses in a human ( 13 ) and wild animals ( 14,15 ) , these reports emphasize the endemicity of these lyssaviruses in south 
                 africa .
clinical signs in the dog and cat , including general neurologic 
                 manifestations with a lack of aggression , are often signs that warrant submitting 
                 samples for rabies testing .
because these viruses are not 
                 exclusive to south africa ( 212 ) , lack of isolates from other regions of africa indicates a lack of active 
                 surveillance and limited diagnostic capabilities in many african laboratories . to 
                 our knowledge ,
in october 2004 , a 3-month - old kitten ( felis domesticus ) was adopted 
                 from the society of the prevention of cruelty to animals ( east london , eastern cape 
                 province , south africa ) and lived with its owner on a farm 23 km outside the city .
