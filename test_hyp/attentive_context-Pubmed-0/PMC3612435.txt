, we transversely analyzed opn levels in patients with mci , newly diagnosed ad , and chronical ad , comparing the results with those obtained in the groups of healthy control and other noninflammatory neurologic diseases ( ond ) .
in this study , the crosswise comparison demonstrated that csf opn concentrations were significantly increased in ad and mci converters compared to ond , and opn protein levels both in the csf and plasma of newly diagnosed ad patients were higher than that of chronical patients .
increased opn expression may exacerbate the abnormal immune response presented in the ad brain by enhancing the survival of activated t cells , which were detected in the brain tissues of ad patients . in conclusion , the bell - shaped curve of csf opn expression in disease progression of cognitive decline has extended the evidence for a role of opn in ad pathogenesis .
our result showed that the csf opn concentration was correlated inversely with the disease duration ( r = 0.51 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 4(b ) ) .
studies demonstrated that high levels of plasma opn were well correlated with the activities of various disease conditions : plasma opn concentrations were significantly higher in systemic lupus erythematosus patients and increase in opn concentration correlated positively and significantly with sledai score in all patients ; serum opn concentrations of patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis were elevated compared to healthy controls and correlated with the transverse diameter of the periaortic cuff as determined by imaging studies .
