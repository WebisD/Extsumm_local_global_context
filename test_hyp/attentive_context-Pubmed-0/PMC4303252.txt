4c ) may be due to the limited data points used in fitting or experimental errors . for both the half - point recovery length and the exponential recovery length , we used bootstrap to compute ses for the indicators by resampling the ensemble of steady - state profiles 100 times and fitting the average recovery profile
we used bootstrap to compute ses of the indicators by resampling 1000 times the ensemble of replicate populations ( for the coefficient of variation and the temporal correlation ) or arrays ( for the spatial correlation ) .
the expectation of moran s coefficient is 1n1 in the absence of spatial correlation ; we used a modified estimator with an additional term 1n1 so that the expectation is 0 . in this case , the sample size n is the number of patches in an array : n=10 for connected populations ; n=5 for isolated populations . for detailed formula of the statistical indicators , see supplementary note 4 . in the analysis we ensured environmental homogeneity by removing a linear gradient of population density observed in connected populations
were adopted , meaning that a population on the edge would have 75% of its cells remaining in the patch during the dispersal step . in the group of isolated populations ,
