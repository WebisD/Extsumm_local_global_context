toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the intracellular protozoon t. gondii , for which the primary host is cats .
this uncertainty therefore could condemn a fetus that might have become contaminated across the placenta to develop a variety of congenital abnormalities , with serious postnatal repercussions for the family and for society as a whole , given that the ensuing costs to the public healthcare system are far from small .
from a critical analysis on the data presented , we can conclude that it is essential to have results available from the igg avidity test and from pcr on the amniotic fluid , so that treatment of pregnant women affected by t. gondii can be adequately managed . without these test results ,
no conclusions regarding the presence or absence of vertical transmission of t. gondii to the fetus can be reached and doubts will remain regarding whether medications that cross the placental barrier , to treat the fetus , should be introduced .
data in the literature consistently draw attention to the importance of proper guidance regarding the commonest means of becoming infected with t. gondii , with the aim of preventing this event within the pregnancy cycle and the possible harm done to the fetus   . a study conducted in the  economic research service  in the united states concluded that approximately half of the cases of toxoplasmosis occurred due to consumption of raw or undercooked meat and that the annual cost of treating such cases in that country was approximately u$ 7.7 billion .
