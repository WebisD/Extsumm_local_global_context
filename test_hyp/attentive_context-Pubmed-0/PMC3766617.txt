these treatments , while providing amelioration in the short term , have proved relatively ineffective in staving off neurological decline , in part due to lack of large scale analyses   . in our review , we hope to summarize past and current research in the area of inflammation and the development of cvs .
an appreciation of these key inflammatory intermediaries will allow for the development of clinically significant interventions in this patient population .
from all indications , one of the major limiting factors in the management of cvs is an understanding of the extent of early brain injury secondary to sah .
subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) is a devastating neurological insult that causes significant morbidity and mortality .
we are currently limited by the difficulty in consistently and accurately diagnosing and treating affected patients .
one of the greatest sources of this morbidity and mortality is cerebral vasospasm ( cvs ) , leading to delayed cerebral ischemia ( dci ) .
morbidity remains high despite years of clinical and basic science research done on the topic , with approximately 50% infarction rates in affected patients   .
currently , the primary treatment for this patient population involves hemodynamic augmentation and medically or surgically mediated intra - arterial vasodilation .
