there was no difference between groups with regard to gestational age , birth weight and apgar scores , but the comparison of cord blood alkaline phosphatase levels revealed a significant difference between the two groups ( p value = 0.041 ) ( table 2 ) .  
cord blood alkaline phosphatase level is a useful indicator in predicting subsequent jaundice in healthy term newborns .
a total of 105 healthy term infants with gestational age between 37 and 42 weeks , weighing more than 2500 g born to healthy mothers were studied .
this study was conducted to evaluate the alp level as a marker for early diagnosis of neonatal jaundice .
they found that alp levels were significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia requiring treatment , either with phototherapy or exchange transfusion ( p value 0.0001 ) ( 4 ) . in our study , there was a significant difference in the levels of cord blood alkaline phosphatase between the non - jaundiced and clinically jaundiced newborns , and it was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia requiring treatment .
a comparison of the roc curves of the alkaline phosphatase levels between the non - jaundiced and treatment groups ( figure 1 ) revealed that a cord blood alkaline phosphatase level > 314
