vaginal evisceration is a rare postoperative complication of hysterectomy ( regardless of the surgical approach ) in women of this age group that carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality and requires rapid surgical intervention .
a 66 year old woman presented to a&e with per vagina bleeding , abdominal pain and a mass protruding from the vagina .
when the patient is received by an emergency department and the problem is determined , the emergency doctors must not delay the administration of broad spectrum antibiotics in preparation for taking the patient to theatre and ensure the prolapsed bowel is covered in saline - soaked gauze , as this improves the bowel chances of viability ( 4 ) .
this case illustrates the need for rapid recognition of vaginal evisceration and its appropriate management in order to avoid morbidity and mortality to the patient .
the first report of vaginal evisceration was described by hyernaux in 1864 , as disruption of the anterior wall of the proximal vagina , resulting in prolapse of the abdominal contents ( 1 ) . since then , there have been just over 120 reports in the literature , although in reality some cases may go unreported ( 1 ) .
