the aim of this study is to examine the influence of patient s age on the mortality rate and survival of patients with acute caustic poisonings , and also to analyze their correlation .
we studied medical records from 415 patients , aged between 14 and 90 years , who were hospitalized and treated , in the period between 2007 and 2011 .
our study showed that in patients with more severe post - corrosive damages in the upper gastrointestinal tract the mortality rate is higher and survival period is shorter .
mortality and survival rates are higher in patients with more severe grades of post - corrosive injuries in the upper gastrointestinal tract , seen with upper endoscopy ( grades ii b and iii ) .
duration of hospital stay and stay in the intensive care unit are positively correlated to the age of patients .
clinical characteristics of patients patients , according to their age , were divided in three groups : 
 group of patients aged between 14 and 35 yearsgroup of patients aged between 35 and 55 years andgroup of patients older than 55 years . 
 
mortality rates in acute caustic poisonings are still very high and are a serious problem during the treatment . percentage of fatal outcomes is higher during the acute phase of treatment ( first 96 hours ) , usually a result of gastrointestinal complications ( perforation ) , while during the chronic phase number of deaths is lower ( 21 days after poisoning ) .
