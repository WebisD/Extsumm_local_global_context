this review paper summarizes the anti - inflammatory potential of hydrazone derivatives and the effect of substitutions of different groups on the anti - inflammatory activity .
this summarized study is an attempt to bring about the anti - inflammatory activity for awaking the safe use of this important chemical moiety with minimal or no ulcerogenic effects in future .
hydrazone derivatives are well known to have various important pharmacological activities and are used for synthesis of a wide variety of medicinally active compounds .
, there is an urgent need for design and synthesis of new chemical entities with excellent anti - inflammatory response and minimum side effects .
inflammation is a physiological reactionwhich involves cellular and biochemical responses , which is not only symptom for common diseases but also known to be an early phase for some serious diseases such as alzheimer 's disease , cancer , heart vascular diseases   etc .
nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) like ketoprofen , ibuprofen , aceclofenac , and so forth under current clinical usage for the treatment of inflammation , algesia and pyresis   are associated with major drawbacks of gastrointestinal disorders like dyspepsia , gastric ulcers , and so forth , due to the direct contact of free carboxylic group with the gastric mucosa   and due to decrease in production of prostaglandins in tissue . in order to overcome these drawbacks
