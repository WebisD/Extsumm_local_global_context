hence , this study was conducted to assess the intubating conditions , using the conventional macintosh laryngoscope and the storz c - mac vl during nti in paediatric patients posted for tonsillectomy surgeries .
thus , c - mac vl improves the nasotracheal intubating conditions and can be superior alternative to macintosh laryngoscope in clinical practice in paediatric patients .
( m3 = combined use of cuff inflation with external laryngeal manipulation was not useful in both the groups ) after induction , haemodynamic parameters ( hr , sbp , dbp and mbp ) decreased in both groups when compared to pre - induction values . at the 1 min after intubation ,
application of optimisation manoeuvres ( m1m5 ) was needed more in group 1 compared to group 2 ( c - mac ) ( 97% vs. 77% ) and was statistically significant p = 0.001 [ figure 2 ] . in group 1 , 30% of patients and in group 2 , 53.3% patients needed additional external manipulation ( m1 ) .
c - mac vl allows adequate glottic view , without the need for aligning oropharyngeal and laryngeal axes .
duration of intubation was significantly shorter in group 2 compared to group 1 patients . in group 1 , 36.6% of patients and in group 2 , 93.3% of patients were intubated within 2 min which was statistically significant p = 0.001 [ figure 1 ] . comparison of intubation time between the groups in group 1 , 3.3% of patients and in group 2 , 23.3% of patients were intubated successfully without the application of manoeuvres ( m0 ) .
