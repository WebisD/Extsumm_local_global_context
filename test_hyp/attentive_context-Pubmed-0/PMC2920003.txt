a 38-year - old man was referred for treatment of a right renal cystic mass found incidentally .
although small renal leiomyomas can be found in about 5% of autopsy specimens , clinical incidence of these lesions is much lower . in this report , we discuss the first case of simultaneous occurrence of a multilocular cystic rcc and a leiomyoma in the same kidney .
this present case is the first report of synchronous renal neoplasms with different histogenesis ( multilocular cystic rcc and leiomyoma ) in a patient without any symptoms .
multilocular cystic rcc represents a rare entity that was recognized in 1982 , with a reported incidence of 1 - 4% of all rccs .
macroscopically , renal cell carcinomas ( rccs ) generally present as either solid or cystic mass . among cystic rccs ,
since multilocular cystic rcc could not be excluded , the patient underwent right laparoscopic radical nephrectomy .
macroscopically , in the mid pole , a well - circumscribed mass showing a multicystic feature with thin fibrous septa and without expansile tumor nodules was noted .
physical examination on admission revealed no palpable mass , and laboratory data were negative . computed tomography of the abdomen showed a about 5.4  4.6 cm poorly enhancing cystic mass with enhancing septa in the polar area of the right kidney ( fig .
