dentists who believed in cam therapies and used them alone had significantly higher odds of agreeing that they were satisfied with their career as a dentist ( or = 3.2 , 95% ci = 1.5 - 5.7 ) and that it contributed to career longevity ( or = 1.92 , 95% ci = 1.4 - 7.3 ) , increased overall health ( or = 1.67 , 95% ci = 1.11 - 6.1 ) , and improved the working efficiency ( or = 2.37 , 95% ci = 1.1 - 7.3 ) , and thus were satisfied with the job ( or = 1.51 , 95% ci = 1.7 - 7.3 ) when compared to users of conventional therapies .
since a large number of dentists all over the world report msds , this study was conducted in western india with an aim to determine if dentists are using cam therapies to manage their msds and , if so , to determine if cam therapies are associated with their job satisfaction and longevity , compared with conventional therapy users .
dentists who suffered from musculoskeletal pain agreed 3 times more that cam therapies were acceptable for msd management ( or = 3.7 , 95% ci = 2.7 - 3.9 ) than those with no pain , and were 3 times more likely to use cam therapies for msd management ( or = 3.4 , 95% ci = 1.4 - 5.9 ) .
