bone from ledges present on the mandibular posterior area was removed with the simple technique of scrapping with a sharp sickle scaler and the resulting graft was used to fill a two wall defect distal to first molar .
the obvious advantage of this technique is the ease of obtaining bone from already exposed surgical sites , but the disadvantages are its relatively low predictability and inability to procure adequate material for large defects . in this case report ,
a 37-year - old male patient reported to the department of periodontology government dental college , calicut with a chief complaint of bleeding from gums and bad breath of 3 months duration . on clinical examination , generalized moderate to deep periodontal pockets and bleeding on probing was noticed .
ledges are frequently found in posterior regions and if properly managed can act as a source of autogenous graft .
another study by bacci et al . showed contradictory results , their histological findings revealed that smaller particle size bone chips , obtained with a piezoelectric device , had less vital bone ( 64.83% ) compared with the small particle size bone chips harvested with a bone scraper ( 75.34% ) . in this case , sufficient amounts of autogenous particulate bone were obtained during the ledge removal process to fill the two wall defect distal to first molar .
