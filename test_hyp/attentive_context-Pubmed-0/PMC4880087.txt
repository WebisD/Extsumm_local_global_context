technical appendix . sampling frame and methods used in a household survey conducted during 20132014 to compare the risk for zoonotic virus infection among humans and livestock in eastern kenya .
the absence of autochthonous human mers - cov infections in africa has triggered hypotheses regarding differences in disease transmission between africa and the arabian peninsula and has raised doubts regarding the role of camels as a source of infection .
the lack of a well - developed public health system in parts of africa could lead to underdiagnosis of clinical cases and would therefore prevent case notification
because of an apparently low infection rate and a bias toward reporting severe cases , the discovery of unreported mers cases requires testing of large sample sizes with well - validated serologic methods ( 6 ) .
the proportion of seropositive specimens that we found is comparable to previously reported proportions of unrecorded infections in the general population in saudia arabia ( 1.52% vs. 1.43% positivity by relisa and 0.15% vs. 0.18% positivity by prnt for kenya vs. saudi arabia , respectively ) ( 6 ) .
other possible explanations for the absence of confirmed and reported clinical cases of mers - cov infection in africa include lesser virulence of strains from africa and cultural differences that might cause persons of different age ranges to be exposed to the virus . on the basis of the ability of mers - cov to infect a wide range of hosts in cell culture experiments ( 15 ) , it remains to be excluded that other wild and livestock animals might act as additional sources of human mers - cov infection .
