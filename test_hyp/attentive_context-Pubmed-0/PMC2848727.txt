the aim of the present article was to develop an optimized and standardized histopathological workup and to test prospectively the hypothesis that current histopathological reports underestimate the proportion of r1 pancreatic head resections . towards this goal , we firstly implemented color coding of the resection margins ( rms ) and the organ surfaces . secondly , we carefully reevaluated the different sites of r1 resections according to the color code and demonstrated that the mesopancreatic rm was the most frequent site of incomplete tumor resection
we strongly believe that the complete and meticulous surgical resection of the mesopancreas as the structure to the right of the mesenteric artery must become the standard surgical approach in pancreatic head resection .
in order to compare the rates of curative and noncurative resections in our department to the published data , we retrospectively identified 115 patients with malignant pancreatic head tumors who had undergone either pppd or a kausch 
whipple procedure between 1996 and 2005 ( n  =  115 ) . for 89 of these 115 patients ( 77.4% ) , the operation could be considered potentially curative , whereas the rms of 26 cancer specimens were positive ( 22.6% ) . in april 2006
