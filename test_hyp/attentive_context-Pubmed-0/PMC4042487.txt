( 2013 ) to compare the properties of a kca1.1-cav3.2 complex to that of a model for kca1.1 activation by the hva cav2.2 ( n - type ) ca channel .
in fact , a similar conclusion was drawn for the importance of the conductive properties of a specific ca source capable of activating sk channels when comparing the large conductance nmda or 9/10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to that of hva ca channels . in the case of cav3 ca channels
the model is also consistent with these results and shows that , when sufficient ca influx is present , the voltage - dependence and kinetics of kca1.1 channel activation resembles that of an lva cav3 ca channel .
, we interpret this to indicate that the relatively weak and transient t - type ca conductance must increase its effectiveness by creating cooperative microdomains , an association more liable to block by egta .
this was further supported by a cav3-dependent activation of kca1.1 current in the form of a low voltage - activated and fast inactivating kca1.1 current .
we considered that the chelator test results might reflect the relative strength of cav3 channels as a ca source , such that the transient ca current and relatively low conductance of cav3 channels may reduce the ability to activate kca1.1 channels . to test this we constructed a model of the kca1.1-cav3 interaction and found that multiple cav3 channels are required to provide reliable activation of kca1.1 channels , perhaps acting cooperatively over larger distances . here , we expand on the model briefly presented in rehak et al .
