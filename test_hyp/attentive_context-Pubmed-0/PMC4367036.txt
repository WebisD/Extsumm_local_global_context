experimental and computational protein design provides vital clues to understand the protein folding process , and it is of considerable interest in the area of protein science to engineer proteins with novel folds and desired functions .
in recent years , coupling of theoretical and experimental approaches in the study of protein folding has resulted in providing fruitful clues .
the field of protein design has a unique history where researchers from diverse discipline come together to explore novel catalytic , pharmaceutical , structural , and sensing properties of amino acids in proteins .
interestingly , they explored these two proteins by  value analysis based on 132 site directed mutants and concluded that the protein 's topology is committed very early along the folding pathway . based on the above studies , we suggest that , along with the suitable protein design experiments , better theoretical models including folding simulations coupled with structure prediction and sequence search in databases can shed light on the phenomenon of protein folding and conformation switching which may ultimately lead us to understand the contribution of each amino acid in these proteins to adopt a specific fold .
literature review of design of two proteins with high sequence identity adopting different folds sequence , dictionary of secondary structure of proteins assigned secondary structures and tertiary structures of pair of homologous heteromorphs ( the seven residues that vary in both sequences are indicated in rectangular boxes ) other researchers have characterized the folding of these two proteins using biophysical and computational experiments .
