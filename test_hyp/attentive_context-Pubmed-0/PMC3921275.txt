the post / pre ratio of scores on the scnt item was significantly higher in the tdcs group as compared with the control group on the auditory cpt ( p=0.017 ) and visual cpt ( p=0.017 ) for attention function ( table 4 ) .
the patients were randomly assigned to two groups : the tdcs group ( n=6 ) and the control group ( n=5 ) . between the two groups ,
our results indicate that the concomitant use of the tdcs with cacr to the prefrontal cortex may provide additional beneficial effects in improving the cognitive dysfunction for patients with stroke .
, we performed cognitive function test with the korean mini - mental state examination ( k - mmse ) and seoul computerized neuropsychological test ( scnt ) .
with the concomitant use of the tdcs with cacr , a relatively safe , convenient , non - invasive treatment modality , there was a significant improvement in the attention in the tdcs group as compared with the control group .
given the above background , we conducted this study to examine the synergistic effects of both cacr and tdcs on cognitive function in patients with stroke . to do this
