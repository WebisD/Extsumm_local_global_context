this study was performed with the aim of evaluation of visual and refractive outcomes after smile for treating post - pkp myopia and myopic astigmatism .
vector analysis of the results of astigmatism correction revealed a mean target induced astigmatism ( tia ) magnitude of 2.61  1.06  d at axis 66  49.1 degrees and a mean surgically induced astigmatism ( sia ) magnitude of 2.06  0.76  d at axis 91.6  59.3 degrees , while the mean of the magnitude of the difference vector was 1.14  0.75 at axis 72.5  53.8 degrees . on comparing the magnitudes of tia versus sia ,
( ranging from 7.0 to 4.0  d ) and the preoperative mean refractive spherical equivalent ( mrse ) was 6.84  1.38  d ( ranging from 9.0 to 5.0 ) .
no statistically significant differences were found among the mrses measured at one week ( 1.26  0.9 ) , one month ( 1.33  0.86 ) , three months ( 1.35  0.85 ) , and six months ( 1.39  0.9 ) ( p = 0.937 ) . on assessing the predictability of astigmatism correction , five out of the ten eyes ( 50% ) had astigmatism above 3.0  d preoperatively , while six months after surgery 30% had astigmatism values within 0.5  d , 50% within 1.0  d , and 70% within 1.5  d ( figure 6 ) .
