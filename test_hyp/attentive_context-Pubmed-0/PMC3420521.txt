in this study , a total 50 individuals ( 31 males and 19 females ) with epilepsy were selected as participants .
so by understanding the relationship between clinical and psychosocial variables in epilepsy a good management plan can be devised for the patients with epilepsy with a focus on social and gender differences .
gender , occupation , and age are found to be non - significant in predicting psychological distress among patients with epilepsy . in order to identify gender differences
seizure frequency is found to be a significant predictor of psychological distress ( b = 1.20 , p = .001 ) accounting for 42% variance in psychological distress ( table 4 ) .
it is therefore important to consider the above - mentioned clinical ( seizure frequency ) and demographic variables ( gender , education , occupation ) in assessment of psychological and social well - being in epilepsy .
the results further indicate that education is also found to be predictor for psychological distress ( b = 1.19 , p = .01 ) .
an in - depth analysis is required to see the economic hardships faced by the patient and its correlate with their social status .
