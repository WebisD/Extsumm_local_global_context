vascular leiomyoma ( vl ) is an uncommon benign tumor composed of smooth muscle cell and vascular endothelium.1 intracranial involvement is quite rare : in fact , only two reports in the literature described an angioleiomyoma involving the cerebellopontine angle ( cpa ) and internal auditory canal ( iac).23 we present the case of a patient with vl localized within the geniculate ganglion and the initial labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve . to our knowledge , no other vl has been previously described in these sites .
in august 2012 , a 45-year - old man came to our department complaining of a grade iii facial paralysis ( house - brackmann scale ) that had arisen 5 months earlier .
we were able to remove the entire lesion , identifying a cleavage plane with the geniculate ganglion and , thus , preserving the anatomical integrity of the nerve ( fig .
we planned an intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy ( icwt ) with eventual facial nerve grafting .
follow - up the patient was tumor - free with a recovery of the facial palsy to grade ii .
to our knowledge , our patient is the first case of vl arising within the geniculate ganglion involving the mastoid and tympanic segment of the facial nerve .
