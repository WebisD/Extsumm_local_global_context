if ai / an are more likely to experience insufficient sleep relative to nhw , as has already been reported among nhb , we aggregate data from the 2009 and 2010 brfss . furthermore , we assess the impact of recognized sleep correlates ( i.e. , socioeconomic indicators , lifestyle behaviors , obesity , age , and fmd ) on potential race / ethnicity disparities in insufficient sleep .
as many risk factors associated with frequent insufficient sleep appear to be of increased prevalence in ai / an , we sought to determine the prevalence of insufficient sleep in a community - based sample of this population . specifically , to examine
our finding of excess insufficient sleep among ai / an thus appears to confirm the importance of sleep health to chronic disease prevention and health promotion in this population .
after age adjustment ( model 1 ) the disparity in frequent insufficient sleep between nhw and nhb ( pr = 1.02 ; 95% ci : 0.991.04 ) was no longer statistically significant . however , both nhb ( pr = 0.95 ; 95% ci : 0.920.98 ) and hispanics ( pr = 0.84 ; 95% ci : 0.810.86 ) remained significantly less likely ( p  0.001 ) to report frequent insufficient sleep than nhw , even after controlling for all the covariates in the model ( model 5 )
