, we will describe some of the pathology informatics challenges that are important to molecular pathology , highlight informatics disciplines of particular relevance to molecular pathology [ tables 14 ] , propose possible rotations and/or research projects to provide informatics fellows with vital practical experience in molecular pathology [ table 5 ] , and outline a suggested curriculum for training pathology informatics fellows with a career interest in molecular pathology .
pathology informatics focuses on pathology information , analysis tools , and processes . due to the recent exponential growth in medical data , discoveries , and diagnostic technologies ;
, we will discuss informatics training in molecular pathology based on our clinical fellowship in pathology informatics experience over the past 5 years .
furthermore , in light of recent federal mandates and upcoming changes in reimbursements , molecular pathologists will need to leverage informatics to adapt the testing environment of a molecular laboratory to these new regulations . in this paper
our fellowship program divides pathology informatics into four main divisions : information fundamentals , information systems , workflow and process , and governance and management . within this framework
informatics solutions have been sought to more effectively analyze , track , integrate , and communicate this important clinical information .
