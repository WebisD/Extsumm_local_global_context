( 2007 ) suggest that the number of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental bacteria has been underestimated and given that they found a new mechanisms of drug resistance more studies with environmental bacteria are essential .
this work quantified the density and diversity of antibiotic resistant soil streptomycetes and even identified genes with novel mechanisms of antibiotic resistance to the recently approved telithromycin and daptomycin .
twenty - two ( 31% ) of the 70 mls and 17 ( 40% ) of the 43 tet genes are unique to environmental bacteria ( tables 2 and 4 ) . whether this represents a true separation between mls and tet genes that are  unique  to environmental bacteria or because the genes are innate to environmental bacteria or that the resistance genes have not been used in surveillance studies of animal / human bacteria is not known .
demonstration that the gene confers antibiotic resistance is required and data mining genomes looking for dna and amino acid similarities to known genes is not adequate to be recognized as a new gene .
antibiotic resistant bacteria are widely distributed throughout the world and have been isolated from deep subsurface trenches , in waste water , surface and ground water , sediments , and soils .
