a comprehensive literature review was conducted to collect available toxicity endpoints for nanotio2 . the literature search ( september 2014 ) was performed within 4 databases  web of science , scopus , google scholar , and the university of british columbia library database  using the following keywords in various combinations : titanium dioxide , tio2 , nanoparticles , phototoxicity , photoactivation , ec50 , lc50 , ic50 , and lowestobservedeffect concentration ( loec ) .
therefore , both the mean and median ( 25.9  wh / m and 5  wh / m , respectively ) insolation used in the studies reporting only values for full spectrum are much less than the insolation values over europe .
the fact that the cladocera taxon was more sensitive to nanotio2 phototoxicity can not be explained by the intensity of irradiation or received insolation during testing , because such correlation was not statistically significant ( spearman rank correlation test ) . in cladocerarelated experiments ,
when uva and uvb level approximations were performed on the studies reporting full spectrum and combined with studies directly reporting uva and uvb , mean and median values were 5.64  w / m and 1.7  w / m , respectively , for uva and 0.243  w / m and 0.015  w / m , respectively , for uvb .
