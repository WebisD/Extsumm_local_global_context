this paper presents general information about phospholipases and details the current knowledge about particular phospholipases a2 involved in asthma and copd in human and animal models .
the data regarding interactions between members of this superfamily is summarized , as well as the role of these enzymes in exacerbations of inflammatory diseases .
intensive studies focused on the pathogenesis of these conditions implicate , among others , the group of phospholipases a2 , which possess enzymatic and nonenzymatic properties .
both asthma and copd are airway diseases characterized by impaired airflow in the respiratory tract , chronic airway inflammation , as well as symptoms such as coughing , dyspnea , and wheezing .
as they demonstrate pro- and anti - inflammatory properties , a detailed analysis of their role should act as a focus for further studies intended to bring new insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases and identify targets for new drugs .
the diagnostic problems concerning the overlap syndrome that shares the features of asthma and copd demand further studies on the pathogenesis of these diseases .
data from studies focused on role of pla2s in inflammatory diseases facilitate the understanding of molecular aspects of inflammation .
