excision of the polyp can be performed by laparoscopy , retroperitoneoscopy , transurethral ureteroscopy , or percutaneous access.12

 17 overall , kojima et al described performing endoscopy via a working port while laparoscopic exploration.4 
  in this case report , we present laparoscopic technique in a patient who had ureteral polyp close to the left upj .
ureteropelvic junction obstruction ( upjo ) in children most commonly occurs due to adynamic segment of ureter .
pediatric surgery is a specialty that has its own characteristics owing to relevance of congenital anomalies .
, a pediatric surgeon should be always alert , for concomitant pathologies , in any anomaly .
previously , ureteral polyp causing upjo in children has been reported in as low as 0.5% of pyeloplasties in children.1 however , in recent studies the incidence reported was around 5%.2

  fibroepithelial polyps are more common in boys than girls.1

  hydronephrosis with ureteral polyp requires surgical treatment , due to the risk of malignity1
