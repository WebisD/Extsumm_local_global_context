the article " efficacy of and tolerance to mild induced hypothermia after out - of - hospital cardiac arrest using an endovascular cooling system " by pichon et al . in the previous issue of critical care  
according to hippocrates , we have to treat the next unconscious cardiac arrest patient with mild therapeutic hypothermia , regardless of which technique we are using .
this high mortality is to a major part due to ischaemic brain damage . in 2002 , a european multicentre trial on the use of mild therapeutic hypothermia  as well as other clinical trials  clearly demonstrated a decrease in mortality and a better neurological outcome in cardiac arrest patients .
only 10% of patients undergoing out - of - hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation are discharged alive from the hospital .
this is far better than with most other  expensive  approaches in the intensive care unit ( icu ) .
the most important ' side effect ' of hypothermia is that it is not used routinely in most cardiac arrest patients .
mild therapeutic hypothermia is definitely underused post cardiac arrest , and many patients who need not die are dying because of this clinical reality . here
