here we describe a case of ipnb in a 77-year - old male with liver dysfunction and diabetes .
although ipnb is considered to be of relatively low - grade malignancy   , the clinical spectrum and characteristics of ipnb itself including postsurgical prognosis have not been fully evaluated . in this report , we present a case of ipnb with subserosal invasion by the component of poorly differentiated carcinoma .
interestingly , the clinicopathological features of ipnb resemble those of intraductal papillary mucin - producing neoplasia ( ipmn ) of the pancreas   .
surveyed such cases in taiwan and also in japan , and they proposed the collective term of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct ( ipnb ) for such biliary papillary tumors .
papillary growing soft tumor was observed in the upper and middle bile duct , and the right lateral glisson 's pedicle and the cystic duct were obstructed by the tumor invasion ( fig .
we performed right hepatectomy and combined resection of the common hepatic and bile duct and a regional lymphadenectomy was added .
, the tumor was diagnosed as an invasive bile duct carcinoma arising from ipnb , pacreatobiliary type .
surgical complete resection is a better therapeutic choice for ipnb to obtain the good prognosis .
