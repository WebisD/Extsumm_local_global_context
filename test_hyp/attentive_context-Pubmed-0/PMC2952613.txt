we report a case of vitreoretinal traction syndrome associated with rp , which spontaneously resolved after posterior vitreous detachment ( pvd ) .
a 81-year - old woman presented with bilateral loss of peripheral vision and defective dark adaptation 15 years before .
retinitis pigmentosa ( rp ) was defined as a group of hereditary disorders that diffusely involve photoreceptor and pigment epithelial function characterized by progressive visual field loss and abnormal electroretinogram .
it might be a choice that a patient with tractional retinal detachment in rp is observed without surgical treatment , if the detached area is not progressive .
slit - lamp examination showed bilateral retinal arteriolar narrowing and intraretinal pigment deposition ( bone spicule pigmentation ) in both eyes ( figure 1a ) .
in this case , an eye with rp was complicated with tractional retinal detachment , possibly associated with increased vitreoretinal traction secondary to the incidence of pvd .
the best - corrected visual acuity was 20/28 and 20/28 in the right and left eyes , respectively .
the visual fields of the patient were markedly constricted to the central 10 in both eyes ( figure 2 ) .
it was reported that vitrectomy was effective for vitreous opacity,5 cystoid macular edema,6 exudative retinal detachment,7 and macular holes8 in rp . however , regarding the indication to perform a vitrectomy , the balance of the expected gain in visual function and usual risks of vitrectomy and rp - related risks , such as phototoxicity worsening of visual field loss , and cystoid macular edema .
