thus even young people with a high bmi show significant damage to vascular endothelial function .
the purpose of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that high bmi in itself in addition to age are the main elements causing reduced blood flow in people with diabetes .
young and old subjects with low and high bmi were examined and their response to heat was measured .
these data were used to establish a multifactor regression equation to predict what blood flow should be in people with diabetes based on their age and bmi . by comparing this to the actual blood flow response to heat , the reduction in blood flow due to diabetes alone could be calculated vs. bmi and age .
the present investigation shows that the majority of this impairment is due to body fat and not ageing and diabetes itself .
the damage we associate with ageing is probably largely due to high concentrations of free radicals damaging the endothelial cells due to obesity .
bioconversion of nitric oxide to peroxynitrite is believed to be one of the mechanisms associated with the reduction in circulation at rest and during stress in older people and people with diabetes and leads to endothelial dysfunction . in a recent study ,
