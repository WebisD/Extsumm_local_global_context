the treatment paradigm for hd patients depends on 3 main clinical domains : movement , psychiatric , and cognitive abnormalities .
stem cell therapy is an effective strategy for curing hd , and many preclinical trials show encouraging results .
antipsychotic agents , including haloperidol , pimozide , and clozapine , are used to treat patients with psychiatric / behavioral comorbidities .
it is caused by an abnormal number of coronary angiography ( cag ) trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene ( htt ) , which encodes a 350 kda ubiquitously expressed protein , huntingtin ( htt).1 hd is characterized by movement disorder , cognitive impairment , dementia , and affective disturbances.2 hd patients have more than 40 cag repeats and show abnormal involuntary writhing movements .
normal htt is ubiquitously expressed and is essential for embryonic development.4 the mechanism of neuronal cell death by mhtt has not been clearly established although previous studies report that it has been linked with mitochondrial dysfunction , transcriptional dysregulation , altered protein - protein interactions , abnormal protein aggregations , and excitotoxicity.57
although the precise mechanism of the stem cell paracrine effect has not been completely elucidated , this strategy has potential for clinical application .
