immunoreactive proteins from ffpe tissues ( for review see 15 ) is a major progress for such approaches and provides the means to quantitate clinically relevant proteins like her2 and analyze cancer - related pathways by reverse phase protein microarray ( rppa)16 . because the field of targeted therapy is growing rapidly , it is important to emphasize the necessity of standardization for pre - analytical as well as analytical settings . in this review , we shed light on new developments for the detection of therapeutic protein targets and diagnostic biomarkers in clinical tissues and comment on suggestions for the standardization of tissue handling and analysis .
in the scope of new targeted cancer therapy approaches new technologies which meet the issues of fast and precise target detection and quantification are desperately needed .
this is problematic as formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) tissue is the main source of patient material world wide . therefore for clinical determination of diagnostic and therapeutic targets new methods
we believe that applying these new techniques - probably in conjunction with novel tissue fixatives - will greatly facilitate the search for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the near future .
