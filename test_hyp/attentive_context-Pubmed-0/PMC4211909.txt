in addition , the work comprises functionalization of plga nps with a monoclonal antibody against the macrophage - specific cell surface receptor , cd64 , which is overexpressed in ra.12 different plga - based nps were prepared in order to compare the effects of each component ( ie , mtx , spions , and anti - cd64 antibody ) on the properties of the nps .
the work consists of the association of spions as a contrast agent for mri , and mtx for ra therapy into poly(lactic - co - glycolic acid ) ( plga ) nps . combining these two agents in a single platform
multifunctional plga - based nanocarriers for drug targeting and in vivo imaging are of particular interest due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility . in this work , by effectively co - associating mtx and spions into plga nps , and successfully functionalizing them with an anti - cd64 antibody , a novel attempt was made to achieve targeted therapy and imaging for ra .
consequently , the proposed nanoparticulate system may potentiate the action of mtx without injuring healthy tissues and organs , simultaneously providing a non - invasive and specific imaging tool for ra . after their development and thorough characterization in this study , these nps are now ready for further in vitro studies aiming for the assessment of their performance in targeting ra macrophages and reducing inflammation at sites of ra .
