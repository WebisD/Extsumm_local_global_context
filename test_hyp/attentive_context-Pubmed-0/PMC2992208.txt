thus , the earlier enrollment would be expected to result in a bias toward worse clinical outcomes , rather than the better results that were found in the ifg group . in summary , ifg is relatively common in the cf population . it does not signify increased risk of progression to diabetes . in our study , it is associated with improved survival , and it appears to be associated with improved pulmonary status in pediatric patients with igt .
mortality was significantly reduced in patients with ifg , and lung function was better in pediatric patients with ifg in the igt group and not significantly worse in adults with ifg and igt or in children and adults with ifg in the ngt and cfrd fh groups .
in the present study of 310 children and adults , ifg was found in 14% of those with ngt , 31% of those with igt , and 53% of those with cfrd fh , with an overall prevalence of 22% .
ifg case subjects within the igt category had significantly better measures of lung function compared with their control subjects with an 20% higher fev1 and a 10% higher fvc ( p = 0.005 and 0.033 , respectively ) .
