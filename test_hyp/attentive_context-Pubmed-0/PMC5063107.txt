this study investigates the existence ( primary aim ) and the characteristics ( exploratory aim ) of predeath grief in a multiethnic asian population using a wellestablished predeath grief scale  the marwit  meuser caregiver grief inventory ( mmcgi ) .
predeath grief is also applicable to dementia caregivers in a noncaucasian population , and it is detectable with an objective scale like mmcgi.to prevent the adverse outcomes of predeath grief , clinicians working with noncaucasian populations need to be sensitive to its presence and to the influence of culture on its expression.identifying shared risk factors between predeath and postdeath grief allows targeted efforts of case finding and early intervention in the predeath setting , thus preventing complicated grief following bereavement .
