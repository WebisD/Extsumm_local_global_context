it is possible to minimize environmental stress , to approach the animal in a physiological context , to study skeletal muscle adaptations in response to re in several experimental conditions , and to compare the responsiveness of rodents ' and humans ' muscles to different re protocols .
the aim of the present report was to propose an experimental model of re for rodents with better conditioning ( no fasting and shocking ) and control of exercise variables ( volume , intensity and rest intervals ) .
we developed an re model that does not use fasting nor electric shock as stimuli for exercise execution , allows operant conditioning so that the animal does not stay  tied  to the training apparatus , and promotes the control of re variables to perform specific muscle function tests . with this model
experimental models characterized by skeletal muscle wasting should also be investigated in order to propose re as a nonpharmacological tool for humans .
thus , the aim of the present report is to propose an experimental model of re for rodents that could mimic ( considering the limitation of the species ) the training carried out in humans .
recently , we conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of this experimental model in counteracting dexamethasone - induced skeletal muscle atrophy , an experimental model characterized by severe muscle wasting and appetite suppression .
