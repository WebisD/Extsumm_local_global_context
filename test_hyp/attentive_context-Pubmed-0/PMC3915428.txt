the purpose of this study was to investigate vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters in hsct patients and to evaluate current dosing regimen based on trough vancomycin concentration measurement .
in summary , conventional vancomycin dosage regimens could not lead to recommended therapeutic serum concentrations in our patients although , optimal trough vancomycin concentration in febrile neutropenia in hsct patients needs to be defined .
large variation in vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters observed among patients of this study along with the difference of vancomycin pharmacokinetics between our patients and other similar studies further explain the need for level monitoring and individualization of vancomycin dosing .
, have shown that patients with neutropenia have an increased total clearance of vancomycin compared with both intensive care unit and control patients , and an increased vd compared with controls .
creatinine clearance of patients on day of vancomycin sampling was correlated with vancomycin clearance ( p < 0.01 ) .
21 patients ( 45.7% ) had trough concentrations above 10 mg / l . of these , 9 patients ( 19.6% of all patients ) had trough concentrations above 15 mg / l , 5 of whom ( 10.9% of all patients ) had trough concentrations above 20 mg / l . 25 ( 54.3% ) patients had trough concentrations of < 10 mg / l and 6 patients ( 13% ) had trough levels of <
