we describe the second us case of naturally acquired inhalation anthrax since the bioterrorism - related infections of 2001 and the third known case worldwide in which the patient received aig ( 2,6 ) . before this case
aig administration in the current case was associated with a reduction in toxemia , although the role of passive immunization in anthrax treatment needs further evaluation .
( 7 ) proposed a scoring system derived from multivariate analysis to distinguish inhalation anthrax from cap on the basis of clinical features at disease onset . in the case - patient described here ,
mediastinal widening , exhibited in the patient in this report , has also been proposed as a characteristic that can distinguish anthrax from cap . when anthrax patients were compared with an age- , sex- , and race - matched control population , mediastinal widening occurred in 82% of anthrax patients and 8% of cap patients ( 8) . a systematic review of inhalation anthrax cases showed improved survival if antimicrobial drugs were initiated during the prodromal rather than fulminant phase of illness : 75% of patients who survived and 10% of those who died were administered antimicrobial drugs in the prodromal phase ( 9 ) .
