prevalence of abnormal findings in our paraclinical studies is as follows : 104 cases ( 68.4% ) had shown some type of abnormalities in both mri and electrodiagnosis , 30 ( 19.7% ) had shown this abnormality only in mri , 21 ( 13.8% ) only in electrodiagnosis , while 10 cases ( 6.5% ) had both normal mri and electrodiagnostic studies .  
there is little research comparing the accuracy of mri with electrodiagnostic methods in the diagnosis of lower extremity radicular pain ; therefore , the aim of this study was to do this in relation to history and clinical findings .
coordination rate ( concordant ) between mri and the results obtained by the electrodiagnosis was 54% , while concordance of mri and electrodiagnosis with clinical findings was 58.6% and 89.5% , respectively .
67 cases ( 44.1% ) had radicular pain in left lower limb , 46 ( 30.3% ) in right , and 39 ( 25.6% ) in both lower limbs .
at first , 165 patients with sciatica ( accompanying lbp ) participated in the study .
although electrodiagnosis is not used as a routine and standard procedure in the diagnosis of lower extremity radiculopathy , in many mri negative but symptomatic patients , this modality has an important diagnostic value .
