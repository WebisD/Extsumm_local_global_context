lack of incentives and awareness are important reasons for why the problem of antibiotic resistance is difficult to overcome .
increasing incentives for supplying new antibiotics requires funding to subsidise r&d costs . to increase awareness ,
resistance is a global phenomenon involving many types of infections , bacteria and substances and data are scarce , particularly so in developing countries .
one problem may be that it is difficult to present a comprehensive picture of the scope of the problem assessable to other than clinical experts .
nevertheless , using data from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system ( earss ) , the european centre for disease prevention and control ( ecdc ) and the european medicines agency ( emea ) issued a report in 2007 on the situation in the eu , norway and iceland for six commonly isolated , often multi - resistant , bacteria ( 4 ) .
this funding could , at least partially , be provided by a fee levied on the use of antibiotics . as the fee would raise the price of antibiotics
, it would also serve as an incentive to reduce antibiotic consumption , thereby contributing to preserving the efficiency of present substances .
