the present study aimed to determine the effect of an 8-week program of joint mobilization 
 on changes in pelvic obliquity and pain level in seventeen female university students aged 
 in their 20 s with sacroiliac joint dysfunction by dividing them into two groups : a joint 
 mobilization group , and a control group .
significant differences were also found between two 
 groups : a group of single treatment with chuna therapy and a group of combined treatment of 
 chuna therapy and spinal stabilization exercise .
the subjects were randomly assigned to a joint mobilization group of 
 eight , and a control group of nine who performed joint mobilization exercise . the mobilization with movement ( mwm ) group was 21.131.46 years old , 158.596.91  cm tall , 
 and 59.5912.93 kg in weight . the control group was 23.202.15  years old ,
the pelvic obliquity dl - dr decreased by 3.25 from 4.88 before the intervention to 1.63 
 after the mobilization exercise in the control mwm group , but increased by 0.22 from 1.89 
 to 2.11 in the control group .
the pelvic torsion l - r decreased by 0.5 from 2.50 to 2.00 in the mwm group , but 
 increased by 0.66 from 1.56 to 2.22 in the control group .
