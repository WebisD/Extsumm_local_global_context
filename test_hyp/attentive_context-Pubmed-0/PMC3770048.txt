therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between diet quality and weight gain in young women from the alswh , using three different diet quality indices , arfs , australian - dqi ( aus - dqi ) , and the fruit and vegetable index ( favi ) .
frequency and variety of fruit and vegetable intakes , and overall diet quality predicted weight gain over six years in this healthy population group of young women . strategies to encourage young women to
it demonstrated that higher scores on either a food variety and frequency index ( arfs ) or an index based on fruit and vegetable variety and frequency alone ( favi ) , predicted lower six - year weight gain in this group of women . in the whole sample
( 1997 )   in 79,236 healthy white non - hispanic american adults found that greater consumption of vegetables ( highest quintile ) was associated with a smaller gain in bmi over 10 years of followup (  = 0.12 ; p = 0.09 , 0.012 ) for women and men , respectively .
more specifically , we found that , in the fully adjustmed model , those who were in the top tertile of favi gained the lowest weight compared with other tertiles (  = 1.6 , ci : 2.4 to 0.3 , p = 0.01 ) .
