the evolutionary hypotheses were tested in a contemporary dutch and a contemporary rural chinese population , two culturally and economically diverse societies , to account for cultural factors , and emotional and instrumental support was controlled for to account for reciprocity . according to the paternity uncertainty hypothesis , grandparents tilt their investments towards their daughters ' children because they are more certain of their genetic relationship with their daughters ' children than with their sons ' children . in the dutch sample a grandparental investment bias towards daughters ' children
they concluded that social factors superseded genetic factors in determining the amount of contact between older parents and their biological and stepchildren .
this conclusion is in line with the results of our study , which suggest that discriminative grandparental investments are not categorically affected by the certainty of the genetic relationship and the reproductive potential of children and , more generally , attest to the importance of testing evolutionary hypotheses in populations from diverse cultural backgrounds .
in contrast to the situation of paternity uncertainty , there is clarity about the absence of a genetic relationship between grandparents and stepchildren or adopted children . however , the chinese sample did not include information on stepchildren and adopted children .
