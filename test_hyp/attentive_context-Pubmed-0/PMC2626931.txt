since previous studies have shown greater osteoblast functions on nano - structured compared to conventional ceramics , metals , polymers , and composites , the ability to create nano - structured roughness on selenium compacts is promising for increasing bone cell functions , while inhibiting the return of bone cancer .
this study provided techniques to create nano - structured roughness without altering chemistry on selenium compacts for anti - cancer orthopedic applications .
the first goal in this effort was to create nano - structured roughness on such materials and to determine bone cell responses on such nano - structured selenium materials .
the main goal of this study was to introduce a new biomaterial naturally found in the human body that has chemopreventive properties for orthopedic implants : elemental selenium .
the sem images of the selenium compacts ( untreated and treated with naoh for different time periods ) revealed various surface roughness .
energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds , leo 1530 ) was used to determine the surface chemistry of the compacts . to investigate osteoblast adhesion on selenium compacts , human osteoblast - like cells ( bone - forming cells ; crl-11372 american type of culture collection , population numbers 1415 ) in dulbecco s modified eagle media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( hyclone ) and 1% penicillin / streptomycin ( hyclone )
