the current study aimed to investigate the incidence of fungal flora on interdigital spaces of the human foot .
the obtained results showed that fungi can survive on the surfaces of skin without showing the sign of infection .
the present study demonstrated the incidence of fungal flora on interdigital spaces of human foot .
the culture was positive in 349 ( 40.3% ) specimens ; and 22 ( % 2.5% ) samples were also positive for both direct examination and culture .
the most common fungal isolates in direct test were yeast ( 29.4% ) , followed by conidia ( 0 .
samples were collected from toe webs of 865 girl students who lived in the dormitories of ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences in autumn 2008 .
overall fungal structure was found on the skin of 30.9% of the students in the direct examination with koh .
the current study performed a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the mycoflora on the surface of interdigital skin of girl students .
yeasts were identified on the bases of germ tube formation , morphology on the corn meal agar medium , and assay of unease activity .
candida species were isolated from 1.2% of interdigital spaces of people in the current study .
