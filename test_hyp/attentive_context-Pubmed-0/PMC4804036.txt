for patients suffering from presbyopia , there are now exciting surgical alternatives to glasses and contact lenses .
pseudophakic patients who still desire better uncorrected near vision may choose corneal - based surgical therapies , such as corneal inlays or laser refractive surgery .
this review will focus on corneal - based surgical strategies to treat presbyopia and in particular how these methods have been or may be used in pseudophakic patients . to improve uncorrected near vision in presbyopia , the two major techniques to alter the cornea generally utilize either an intracorneal inlay device or laser refractive surgery .
nevertheless , presbyopic surgeries will not be ideal for all patients , and appropriately screening patients and managing patient expectations are both key to maximizing satisfactory outcomes .
the term  presbyopia  derives from greek for  old eyes    and refers to the age - related loss of natural accommodation and resulting reduction of baseline near vision around the age of 40 years . as people continue to work and stay active later in life than ever before , their need for quality vision at both near and distance vision is also growing .
laser blended vision treatment seems to provide the best compromise in terms of safety and quality of vision .
