releasing , retrieving and transferring the doped si nms onto a temporary substrate , consisting of si wafer with a bilayer coating of pi / pmma , followed procedures similar to those described for passive electrode arrays .
a craniotomy exposed a 48 mm region of cortex in either left or tight or in both hemispheres .
fabrication of the passive electrode arrays began with solid state phosphorus doping ( ph-1000n source , saint gobain , usa , 1000 c for 10 minutes ) of p - type device si on a si on insulator ( soi , top si ~300 nm , soitec , france ) wafer . removing the buried oxide layer of the soi by wet etching with concentrated hf released the device si as a si nm , retrieved with a slab of the elastomer poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) and transfer - printed to a spin - cast bilayer of poly(methylmethacrylate ) ( pmma , ~800 nm thick ) and polyimide ( pi , ~300 nm thick ) on a si wafer .
selective rie and buffered oxide etching through these multilayer stacks ( diluted pi / trilayers of inorganic materials / trilayers of inorganic materials / diluted pi ) formed mesh structures that enabled release of active layers from the temporary substrate by dissolving the pmma layer in acetone .
