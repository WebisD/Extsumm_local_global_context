a 48-yr - old man presented with left chest pain , abdominal pain , and dyspnea of three days duration .
we consider that combined medical treatment and timely surgical intervention played an important role in the cure achieved in our patient , who experienced no major post - operative complications . in conclusion , although acute phlegmonous esophagogastritis is rare and a preoperative diagnosis is difficult , awareness of this disease entity and prompt diagnosis based on typical chest ct findings are major key factors to successful treatment .
however , the role of surgery has been questioned for the diffuse disease form ( 2 ) .
therefore , strong suspicion and recognition of this disease is a key to the diagnosis and prompt management of patients with acute symptoms .
