although numerous reports include infants with e. sakazakii isolated from nonsterile sites , such as respiratory secretions or stool , 46 infants identified from the literature and cdc sources met the case definition for this analysis ( 1,9,10,12 ) . of the infants with sterile - site infection
. these actions , adopted in whole or in part , may decrease the infectious risks associated with powdered formula and prevent this rare but potentially devastating disease .
we reviewed the literature for reports of e. sakazakii disease in infants . using medical subject heading terms " e. sakazakii " or " enterobacter " in combination with " newborn , " " infant , " or " meningitis ,
manufacturer warning labels on powdered infant formula packages should stress that powdered infant formula is nonsterile and requires proper preparation , handling , and storage , and that sterile , liquid formula alternatives are available
contrary to previous characterizations of e. sakazakii disease , we found that infants with meningitis and bacteremia alone fell into 2 distinct groups .
finally , we reviewed e. sakazakii case consultations conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) from 1998 to 2005 and reviewed results of a french outbreak reported to cdc in 2005 ( 14 ) .
