there is an increase in the use of angiotensin ii type 1 receptor antagonists ( at ii antagonists ) and angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors ( ace - inhibitors ) as prophylactic treatment of migraines , in addition to their use as antihypertensives .
these drugs induce severe renal histological abnormalities , including papillary atrophy , tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and dilatation   . nonetheless , there is reason to believe that an increasing number of women of reproductive age will use these drugs .
these drugs pass the placenta and have highly adverse effects on the renal organogenesis , leading to maldevelopment firstly of the renal system and secondarily of the lungs   .
a variety of drugs from diverse pharmacological classes are in use for migraine prevention . at ii antagonists and ace - inhibitors are traditional antihypertensives that have proved to be effective also in migraine prophylaxis .
their fetotoxic effects have been demonstrated in humans   and well documented in animal research . when administered to rats , mice or piglets during renal development
the fetus is autopsied without conclusive diagnosis . in the woman s next pregnancy , only 6  weeks later
one week later , the midwife finds a declining symphysis to fundus increment , and the woman is therefore immediately referred to the hospital .
