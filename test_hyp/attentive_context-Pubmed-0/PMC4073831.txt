we found that reaction of the e. coli class iii rnr with ctp in the absence of 
 formate resulted in stoichiometric accumulation of a thiosulfuranyl 
 radical , comprising a cysteine thiyl radical stabilized by a three - electron 
 bond to a methionine residue . this new sulfur - based radical joins 
 other sulfur - based radicals observed in the other two classes of rnrs : 
 the class ia disulfide anion radical proposed 
 to be involved directly in nucleotide reduction and the class ii exchange 
 coupled
our results suggest that detecting thiyl radicals and controlling 
 their reactivity may require an orchestrated constellation of residues 
 adjacent to the thiyl radical that protects it from alternative chemistry 
 while allowing the reaction to proceed rapidly when the substrate 
 ( effectors ) is in the appropriate conformation .
ribonucleotide reductases 
 ( rnrs ) perform an essential function 
 in all organisms , catalyzing the conversion of ribonucleotides into 
 deoxynucleotides and providing the monomeric precursors required for 
 dna synthesis and repair ( chart 1 ) .
our isotopic labeling studies with nrdd / ctp / atp provide strong 
 evidence for localization of the radical on cysteine and methionine 
 as hyperfine interactions associated with both cysteine -protons 
 and the methionine - and -protons are observed .
