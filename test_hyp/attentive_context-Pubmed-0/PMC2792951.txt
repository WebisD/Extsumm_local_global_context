preliminary data indicate that it is possible to implement an assay that still will require appropriate standardization before being used in large scale screening programs .   in our protocol , after stimulation of the cells with the gad65 114 - 122 epitope , we successfully detected a percentage of cd8 + gad autoreactive t cells in a sample population including 15 t1d patients ( 9 newly diagnosed and 6 long - standing ) by using hla class i tetramers .
we need also to underline that the   possibility of testing frozen / defrosted pbmc is of paramount importance when planning large retrospective epidemiological investigations .    by applying these novel experimental conditions , the recovery of cd3+/cd8+/gad65 reactive t cells in t1d patients ranged from 0.5% to 15.6% after gad65 peptide stimulation of pbmc . to our knowledge , this is the highest percentage of autoreactive cd8 t cells ever  captured  by hla class i tetramers in pbmc of patients with a human autoimmune disease ( 0,1% to 1% in vitiligo   4,2% in heart transplantation ; up to 0.4% of cd8 + cd45ro+ t cells in newly diagnosed t1d patients ; between 2.6% and 8.3% within the ki-67+cd8 + cell fraction ( 1.65%   + /0.25%   of the total cd8 + lymphocytes ) in islet transplanted t1d patients ) .
