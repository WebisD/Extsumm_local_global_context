diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working - age persons around the world.1,2 it can be found in three out of four patients within 15 years of the diagnosis of diabetes.3,4 visual impairment is most commonly a consequence of diabetic macular edema ( dme).5,6 while vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are usually used first for dme , intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide monotherapy ( ivta ) has also been proven to be efficacious for refractory dme and vision loss in eyes that fail laser therapy.1,7 it has been shown to improve vision and reduce central macular thickness ( cmt ) , with benefits persisting for up to 5 years.810 moreover , for patients with earlier dme , ivta followed by laser photocoagulation has been shown to double the chance of an improvement in vision by ten or more best - corrected logarithm of minimum angle of resolution letters at 2 years compared to laser alone.11 this result can be contrasted with the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network trial , which found that only the subset of eyes that were pseudophakic at baseline had better visual acuity outcomes after ivta combined with prompt laser treatment.12 the divergent findings may in part be due to differences in study protocol , ie , the shorter period of time between ivta and laser therapy in the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network study ( 310 days versus 6 weeks ) may not have allowed sufficient time for the edema to resolve before application of the laser.11,12 since patients often require more than one injection with ivta , they may be at higher risk of dose - dependent steroid - related adverse events , principally cataract and raised intraocular pressure ( iop).1315 this paper examines whether it is possible to predict from baseline characteristics the number of ivta injections patients will require once they embark on a course of combined therapy with laser photocoagulation .
