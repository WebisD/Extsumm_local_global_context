patient pathway to ( relative ) freedom  a step which can be made much easier if staff are familiar with the  stages of change model   and have a basic understanding of motivational interviewing .
while it is true that not all patients are able to dialyse themselves at home , it is a sad fact that many are never given the chance , despite the fact that  patient choice has never been more discussed as an answer to almost any health care problem . although studies suggest that renal physicians and nurses regard home dialysis as the best treatment , it is in decline in most european countries , yet  in - centre hospital - based dialysis is the most expensive and most disempowering option available .
the practical barriers to home therapy vary from unit to unit but need to be identified and overcome if patients are to benefit from self - management
. however , it can be difficult to convince both staff and patients if they have no direct experience or training in this aspect of renal replacement therapy .
the stages of change model coupled with basic motivational interviewing techniques can enable staff and patients to engage with each other in a more meaningful way such that many patients will be better able to understand the benefits of self - management and treatment at home .
