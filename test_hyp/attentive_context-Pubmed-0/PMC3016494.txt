information combining results of toxicity tests and the body burden of animals could offer the ability to identify the chemicals that should be reduced in amount to improve the state of a site
. age and reproductive stage can affect behavioural results ; when energy is placed in reproduction , less energy can be dedicated to behaviour .
borja and dauer ( 2008 ) describe the four corners of environmental quality assessment as :  ( 1 ) assessing ecological integrity , ( 2 ) evaluating if significant ecological degradation has occurred , ( 3 ) identifying the spatial extent and location of ecological degradation and ( 4 ) determining causes of unacceptable degradation in order to guide management actions .  the identification of cause represents a major issue that has been addressed in toxicity identification evaluation ( tie ) or in effects evaluation analysis studies .
seasonal variations are especially pronounced with cold - water marine organisms and hinder the repetitive use of the above species at any time of the year .
( 2007 ) provide a wealth of references on this aspect of risk assessment and outline the critical role played by chemical analyses .
this publication discusses the regulations produced in some countries to protect and/or restore marine ecosystems , and the need for  early warning
