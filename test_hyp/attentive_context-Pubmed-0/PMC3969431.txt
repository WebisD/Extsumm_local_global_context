high serum urate levels , a concomitant history of advanced renal disease , previous gout attacks ( podagra ) , and the cutaneous manifestation of tophi all point to the diagnosis .
one review of the literature found that the lumbar spine was most commonly affected ( 56% of cases ) , followed by the cervical and thoracic spine , which both occurred in 22% of cases.2 out of these cases , the most common presenting symptoms were nonspecific paraparesis ( 39.0% ) , radiculopathy ( 27.0% ) , and back pain ( 18.0%).3 given the rare incidence and nonspecific presentation , an inclusion of gout in the differential diagnosis of atypical neurocompressive pathologies is necessary for diagnosis . in the spine , gout may affect the epidural space , ligamentum flavum , intervertebral disc , pedicles , facet joint capsule , and neural foramen.4 this may present as spinal stenosis , lumbar radiculopathy , spondylolisthesis , or cauda equina syndrome .
this well - documented case and thoughtful commentary impresses upon us the importance of a thorough physical examination of spine patients , including integument and joints outside the axial skeleton .
