therefore , we conducted an observational study of the role of expert feedback in laparoscopic skills acquisition during a mandatory course in residency training .
in general , the self - perceived competence improved significant for laparoscopic knot tying and the use of the scissors ( wilcoxon signed - rank test , p  <  0.001 ) .
however , in one study , residents showed to be capable to rate their own laparoscopic skills with good reliability and validity .
training objectives need to be predefined and to be clear to both tutor and trainee , in order to guide and structure the feedback . in a bls course , most benefit can be obtained at the start of the learning curve .
admittedly , the self - perceived competence is not the most objective and accurate measure for assessment of skills level .
residents who were in an earlier phase of residency , expressed in smaller number of pgy , rated their skillfulness prior to the course lower than the ones who were more experienced ( spearman s rank correlation test ,   =  0.19 , p  =  0.04 ) .
this study revealed that residents judge feedback as a factor that positively influences their skills acquisition during a basic laparoscopic skills course .
