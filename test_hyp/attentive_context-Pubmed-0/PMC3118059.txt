we are reporting a unique case of t - pll developing in h - mds , and this is probably the first case report in the literature .
lymphoproliferative disorders , especially t - prolymphocytic leukemia ( pll ) developing in an h - mds patient , is extremely rare and has an aggressive course .
myelodysplastic syndromes ( mdss ) represent a group of clonal hematological disorders characterized by progressive cytopenia reflecting defects in erythroid , myeloid and megakaryocytic maturation .
to conclude , the finding of activated and clonal t - cell population in mds is further argument for the use of immunosuppression to treat the cytopenias of mds .
an association between mds and autoimmune disorders and with chronic t - cell disorders like large granular lymphocytic leukemia ( lgl ) has been recognized and is suggestive of an abnormal functioning immune system in mds .
hypoplastic mds ( h - mds ) accounts for 1217% of all patients with mds .
but , occurrence of t - pll in h - mds is extremely rare and , possibly , this is the first case in the literature .
the diagnosis may be difficult in h - mds if the aspirate is so sparsely cellular as to preclude cytogenetic studies .
