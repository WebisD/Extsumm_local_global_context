in addition , persistently elevated levels of scd14 and tgf-1 , despite successful haart , are consistent with chronic activation of monocytes / macrophages and possible risk of a poor outcome , underscoring the adjunctive therapeutic potential of monocyte / macrophage - targeted anti - inflammatory chemotherapy in patients with advanced hiv infection .
the same 5 biomarkers ( cxcl9 , cxcl10 , tgf-1 , 2 m , and scd14 ) were also significantly elevated compared with the control group ( p < 0.02 ) , the values for cxcl10 and 2 m being somewhat lower than those of the pre - haart group ( p < 0.03 ) , while those of cxcl9 , tgf-1 , and scd14 were essentially comparable ( p > 0.5 ) .
stnf - r1 , 2  m , and scd14 were significantly elevated ( p < 0.03 ) and ccl4 significantly decreased ( p = 0.04 ) in the pre - haart group relative to the control group , while ifn- was moderately increased but not significantly so ( p = 0.07 ) . following 6 months of haart , cxcl9 , cxcl10 , 2  m , ifn- , il-6 , tnf- , and stnf - r1 were significantly decreased ( p < 0.01 ) , ccl4 increased ( p < 0.001 ) , while tgf-1 and scd14 also remained elevated despite undetectable plasma vl .
