mutation in the hnf1 gene causes steatosis,22 therefore most cases of h - hca also show marked steatosis.7,11 a correlation study between genotype and phenotype of each subtype revealed a strong association between h - hca and the presence of steatosis , the absence of cytological atypia , and absence of inflammatory infiltrate.6 however , one of our l - fabp - negative cases was not consistent with the description in the new classificat ion system because it did not have steatosis but did have cytological atypia .
the incidence of hca in korea is very low and only a few cases of hca have been reported in korea during the past 25 years.19 the recent hca classification was established based on previous studies of genetic and phenotypic characteristics of hca and hepatic nodular hyperplasia.9,10,15,17,18,20 pathologically , the subtype classification enables an accurate diagnosis of this rare entity even with a small biopsy specimen.8,21 l - fabp immunohistochemistry is especially helpful in the identification of h - hca because hnf1 positively regulates fabp1 in normal liver tissue .
atypia in i - hca does not seem to be uncommon , and occurred at a rate of approximately 50% in one previous report.6 the bordeaux group pointed out the presence of cases with overlapping features of i - hca and -hca.13 i - hcas are have been reported to present with a lower than moderate level of steatosis in 94% of cases.6 in our study , two of the four i - hcas presented with 5% steatosis while the remaining three showed none .
