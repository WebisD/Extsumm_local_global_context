we described a 29-year - old man who presented with a symptom of cerebrovascular accident ( cva ) and concomitant asymptomatic lvnc and la standstill .
left ventricular noncompaction ( lvnc ) is a rare primary congenital cardiomyopathy arising from intrauterine arrest of myocardial compaction .
it results in persistent prominent ventricular trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses and is characterized morphologically by 2 layers i.e. , thin compacted epicardial layer and thickened noncompacted endocardial layer.1 ) the prevalence of lvnc is approximately 0.05%-0.24% in the general population according to echocardiography , the diagnostic tool of lvnc.2 ) the etiology of lvnc is unidentified ; however , possible linkage between the disease and various genetic background is recently suspected.3 ) diverse clinical manifestations previously reported range from no symptom to the development of heart failure , arrhythmias , systemic embolic events or sudden cardiac deaths.3 ) interestingly , several abnormal electrocardiograms ( ecgs ) were reported in lvnc patients but none had the feature of left atrial ( la ) standstill imitating atrioventricular ( av ) nodal block .
here we reported a case of a young man who had lvnc combined with la standstill with cva sequel without any cardiac symptoms .
