in addition , we correlated the loss of expression of e - cadherin with various clinical and pathologic prognostic factors . while correlating the prognostic criteria with e - cadherin loss , we considered the inherent loss of e - cadherin in all lobular breast carcinomas , irrespective of their histopathologic grade , and the expression of other prognostic tumor variables that previous studies have not considered .
e - cadherin loss is rare in invasive non - lobular carcinomas and does not correlate with established prognostic variables when ilc is excluded .
e - cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed in normal breast tissue and is useful as a phenotypic marker in breast cancer , with absence of its expression frequently observed in lobular type tumors . reduced or impaired e - cadherin expression is associated with a reduced disease - free interval and overall survival and with other indicators of poor prognosis including a larger tumor size , higher histological grade , and development of distant metastasis and er receptor negative tumors .
reduced e - cadherin expression was an adverse prognostic biomarker in some studies  . although most studies show reduced expression of e - cadherin to be associated with high histopathologic grade , correlation with nodal metastasis and loss of estrogen receptor ( er ) and progesterone receptor ( pgr ) have been shown in only some studies . with the exception of histopathologic grade
