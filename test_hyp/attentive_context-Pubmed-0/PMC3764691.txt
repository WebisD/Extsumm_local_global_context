we describe a patient showing fdg - avid metastases to the skeletal muscles along with a previously unknown primary tumor in the right lung , in a patient presenting with initial muscular symptoms without any pulmonary manifestations .
f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) imaging is useful in the identification of primary in carcinoma of unknown origin .
the present case , where the initial presentation was of metastatic muscular involvement , highlights the role of fdg pet / ct in tracing the location of primary lung malignancy and unsuspected sites of multiple muscle metastases in a patient with muscle metastases of unknown primary .
skeletal muscle metastasis as the initial presentation of an unknown primary lung cancer is unusual .
the patient underwent a whole body f-18 fdg pet / ct to identify the site of the primary malignancy .
. primary presentation of a skeletal muscle metastasis , such as in our case , remains an unusual occurrence .
multiple muscle metastases from lung cancer are rare , and fdg pet / ct imaging is useful in the identification of unsuspected metastatic sites
abnormal fdg uptake was also noted in a presacral mass [ figure 1c and e ] , the bulky left adrenal gland , several dorsal vertebrae and multiple lesions in the trapezius [ figure 1b and d , red arrow ] , right brachioradialis [ figure 2 ] , deltoid , and right external oblique muscles [ figure 3 ] , suggestive of metastatic involvement . a diagnosis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was pathologically
