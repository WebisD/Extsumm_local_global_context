increased level of prl and low level of ft3 , ft4 , and cortisol correlated significantly with the severity of tbi . during acute phase of tbi at least assessment of cortisol
the ft4 and ft3 positively correlated with gcs ( r = 0.31 ; p = 0.041 , r = 0.49 ; p = 0.0003 , respectively ) . in our male cohort
cortisol levels were significantly higher in patients with low gcs ( r = 0.42 ; p = 0.0027 ) and cortisol levels were positively correlated with acth levels ( r = 0.43 , p = 0.002 ) suggestive of hypothalamo  pituitary  adrenal axis activation .
igf-1 did not correlated with severity of injury while gh is higher in patients with severe compared to mild tbi ( p = 0 .
there was no significant difference in mean ft4 , tsh , prl cortisol , acth , fsh , lh , igf - i , gh , and total testosterone between the ns and s. logistic regression analysis revealed that mortality after tbi was unrelated to the basal pituitary hormone levels except low t3 level , which was found related to mortality . comparison between survivors and nonsurvivors of traumatic brain injury
