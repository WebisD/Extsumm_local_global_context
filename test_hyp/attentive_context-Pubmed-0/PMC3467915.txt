with its potential usefulness to differentiate the periapical lesions , ultrasonography can be considered as a better imaging modality with improved efficacy when compared to conventional radiography . in comparision to histopathologic diagnosis ,
ultrasonography showed less accuracy and thus can be considered to be a supplementary tool in the differential diagnosis of periapical lesions .
further research can be directed in larger samples and in different types of periapical lesions to assess the diagnostic validity of ultrasonography .
the correlation between histopathologic and ultrasonographic diagnoses was found to be in 13 ( 86.7% ) subjects . comparing the results of ultrasonography with the histopathologic features , the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value of ultrasonography to diagnose periapical lesions were calculated . in our study
correlation of histologic features with ultrasonographic findings correlation of histologic features with ultrasonographic findings out of the 15 subjects , 2 ( 13.3% ) were diagnosed as periapical granuloma ultrasonographically , whereas 1 ( 6.7% ) was diagnosed as periapical granuloma histopathologically and the correlation between ultrasonographic and histopathologic diagnoses was found to be in 1 ( 50% ) subject . out of the 15 subjects , 1 ( 6.7% ) was diagnosed as periapical abscess ultrasonographically , whereas no subjects were diagnosed as periapical abscess histopathologically and there was no correlation between ultrasonographic and histopathologic diagnoses in this subject .
