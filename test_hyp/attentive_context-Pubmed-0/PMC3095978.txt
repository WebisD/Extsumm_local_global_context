the ms prevalence may be due to lack of awareness and unhealthy lifestyles , so health education and more preventive measures should decrease the prevalence of ms and cardiac risks in nepal .
there was no correlation between physical activity and the other two ms components : high triglyceride ( r = 0.003 , p > .05 ) and abdominal obesity ( r = 0.003 , p >
abdominal obesity , with the revised reference values , is an important risk due to its physiological relationship to the other ms risk factors .
the ncep scores had a positive correlation between the family history of diabetes ( r = 0.83 , p < .01 ) and hypertension ( r = 0.115 , p < .01 ) .
the prevalence of ms ( ncep scores ) had a significant positive relationship with education levels and physical activity .
this study aims to establish the prevalence of hypertension , diabetes , obesity , and metabolic syndrome in the participants of a major health screening programme in nepal .
there were significant positive correlations between physical activity and the three individual ms components : high glucose ( r = 0.03 , p < .01 ) , high bp ( r = 0.04 , p < .01 ) , and low hdl ( r = 0.23 , p < .01 ) .
