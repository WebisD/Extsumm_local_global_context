the findings of kuhn et al . supported the etiologic role of hemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with or without inflammation   .
staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolate ( 15/34 , 44.1% ) , followed by group b streptococcus ( 12/34 , 35.3% ) .
patients presenting at our clinic with signs and symptoms of chronic tonsillitis were enrolled for the study .
the gram - negative bacteria consist of klebsiella pneumoniae 3/34 , 8.82% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1/34 , 2.94% ( table 1 ) .
others were , streptococcus pyogenes ( group a streptococcus ) , 1/34 , 2.94% ; and untypable streptococcus spp . 2/34 , 5.88% .
we investigated the common pathogens causing this condition in our hospital and report here our findings .
thirty isolates were gram - positive bacteria and only four were gram - negative , made up of two genera , klebsiella and pseudomonas .
all the cases were chronic and most of them took antibiotics before presenting to us .
there were 34 bacterial isolates from 52 patients , giving a percentage positivity of 65.38% .
we did not encounter any mrsa in our study ; and all the staphylococcus aureus isolated were sensitive to augmentin and vancomycin .
