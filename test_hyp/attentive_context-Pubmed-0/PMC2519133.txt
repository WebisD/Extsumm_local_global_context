similarly , mice deficient in 
 lt , lt , and the lt receptor ( ltr ) are more susceptible to listeria 
 monocytogenes infection than wild - type mice   . given that lt is important in the control of these 
 intracellular bacterial pathogens , in the present study we sought to determine 
 whether it also plays a role in host defense against low - dose aerosol infection 
 with a virulent type a strain of f. 
 tularensis .
in addition , the inflammatory responses to the infection , 
 as reflected by the cytokine 
 levels and leukocyte influx in bal fluid and histopathological analysis , were generally similar between lt/ and lt+/+ mice .
initially , a total of 22 lt/ and 14 lt+/+ mice were challenged by 
 low - dose aerosol with virulent type a f. tularensis and their survival monitored . 
 with the exception of two lt/ mice and one lt+/+ mouse , all mice succumbed to 
 infection between day 
 4 and 7 with a median time to death of 5 days ( range 46 days for lt/ mice and 57 days for lt+/+ mice , p > .05 by 
 kaplan - meier survival analysis ) ( figure 1 ) , indicating that lt/ mice are no more susceptible to 
 low - dose aerosol challenge with this strain of the pathogen than control lt+/+ mice .
