we evaluated the efficacy of spongioplasty alone after mobilization of corpus spongiosum in prevention of urethral fistula in patients undergoing tip repair for hypospadias .
a more proximal hypospadias is associated with poorer spongiosum and this is likely to increase the chances of complications . better developed and thicker spongiosum results in lower incidence of fistula formation after tipu .
correlation of type of hypospadias , development of spongiosum and complications three ( one each in distal , mid and proximal ) out of thirteen ( 23.03% ) cases with poorly developed spongiosum and six ( distal 1 , mid 1 and proximal 4 ) out of 53 ( 11.32% ) cases with moderately developed spongiosum developed a fistula while none of the cases with well - developed spongiosum developed a fistula .
spongioplasty reconstructs a near normal urethra as per anatomical principles of surgery with least complications .
two patients had meatal stenosis with fistula and seven patients had urethral fistula ( clavien - dindo grade 3b ) alone with an overall complication rate of 7.96% .
on correlating the type of hypospadias with development of spongiosum ; more proximal hypospadias was associated with poorer development of the spongiosum ( p = 0.05 ) [ table 1 ] .
