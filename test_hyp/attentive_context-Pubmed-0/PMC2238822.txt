the various attributes of m  comprehensive data and metadata , uniform normalization , access to raw data dumps , a computable structure , versioning of the database and web - based analysis tools  facilitate both efficient human interrogation of the dataset and machine - based computational analysis .
importantly , experimental metadata in m is human curated from each microarray publication  converting each chemical and growth attribute into a structured and computable set of experimental features with consistent naming conventions and units . finally , all versions of the database builds are maintained and accessible in perpetuity on the website to facilitate the future interpretation and comparison of results published on m data .
a set of web - based browsing and analysis tools is provided to facilitate efficient interrogation of the dataset without extensive computational skills .
the second obstacle is the presence of platform - specific biases in expression data due to the use of many different microarray platforms in a compendium .
moreover , the consistency and uniformity of the dataset facilitates downstream comparison of results and findings based on the dataset .
in contrast to the bulk of dna sequencing , which has been taken over by large centers that automatically submit sequencing reads to centralized databases ( e.g. genbank ) , the majority of microarray expression data is still generated by smaller laboratories addressing particular biological questions . given the diversity of expression possibilities in the cell and the stochastic nature of transcription and of microarrays themselves ,
