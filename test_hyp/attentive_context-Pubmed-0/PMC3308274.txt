the prevalence of elevated alt was also higher in the dysglycemia group ( 13.0 vs. 4.9% ; p = 0.03 ) , but no differences in the prevalence of dyslipidemia ( p = 0.07 ) or hypertension ( p = 0.14 ) were noted .
although screening obese children and youth with a fasting tg provides moderate sensitivity and specificity and is better than currently recommended approaches , 30% of obese children with igt will not be identified using this screening criteria , suggesting that an ogtt be done in all obese children and youth .
in fact , a fasting tg > 1.17 mmol / l had better discriminatory capacity and clinical usefulness than current ada criteria in identifying isolated igt .
other cardiovascular risk factors that predicted dysglycemia included serum tg ( 1.87   ; p = 0.0003 ) and sbp ( 1.04   ; p = 0.01 ) .
had fasting glucose < 5.6 mmol / l ( ada cutpoint for ifg ) . among our population of obese children and adolescents , important risk predictors for
roc analysis of models for prediction of isolated igt using ada criteria using thresholds for each variable in model 4 , the potential predictors age > 10 ( p = 0.49 ) , pubertal ( p = 0.52 ) , parental t2 dm ( p = 0.15 ) , hba1c > 5.7% ( p = 0.43 ) , fasting blood glucose ( p = 0.85 ) , sbp > 95th centile ( p = 0.82 ) , and bmi z score > 2.58 were not significant and were not included in the final logistical model .
