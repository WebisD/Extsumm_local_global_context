 to learn about the normal anatomy of the neural tube on mri  to recognise the mr appearance of neural tube defects  to understand the value of mri in assessing ntds
technological developments in diagnostic imaging have improved the diagnosis and treatment of congenital anomalies immensely , and this progress is especially evident in neural tube defects ( ntds ) .
ultrasonography allows accurate assessment of the neural tube . fetal magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) complements ultrasonography , confirming the suspected anomaly and even detecting malformations that were not detected at ultrasonography .
the additional information provided by mri may lead to changes in the management of the pregnancy and/or of the delivery   . in this article
we describe the radiological , pathological and clinical features of the most common ntds , and finally emphasise an integrated clinical and radiological approach for accurate diagnosis .
their prenatal diagnosis can predict the viability of the fetus , has implications for family counselling about the pregnancy , and orients the prognosis and management of the newborn .
fetal mri has advanced rapidly in the last 25  years , developing from an experimental technique to become a fundamental tool in normal clinical practice in many centres around the world .
