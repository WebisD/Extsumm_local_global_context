other investigators reported poor outcomes among patients who were co - infected with influenza viruses and s. aureus ( 3,4,7 ) .
last , influenza - like illness icd-9-cm codes were used to identify the cohort because the patients initially were included in a study of influenza - like illness and s. aureus pneumonia ( j.s .
therefore , patients may have been missed if they had a respiratory infection with s. aureus and the condition or symptoms were not captured through an icd-9-cm code . in conclusion , among patients whose respiratory cultures grew s. aureus , patients with influenza were significantly more likely to die than were patients whose influenza tests were negative .
kallen et al . found a statistically significant increased risk for death among patients who had positive influenza test results and community - acquired s. aureus pneumonia , compared with patients who had negative influenza test results and community - acquired s. aureus pneumonia ( 7 ) .
interventions that increase influenza vaccination rates among patients at high risk for s. aureus respiratory infections may prevent both co - infection and death .
of the 32 influenza - positive patients , 9 ( 28% ) died ; of the 163 influenza - negative patients , 18 ( 11% ) died ( or 3.15 , 95% ci 1.277.86 ; p = 0.021 ) ( table 2 ) . of the 9 influenza - positive patients who died , 5 had mrsa . among the 27 patients who died , those with a positive influenza test
