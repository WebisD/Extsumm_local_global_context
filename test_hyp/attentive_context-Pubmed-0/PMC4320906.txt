however , the level of toxic heavy metals only showed slight difference between the two systems . as conclusion ,
bearing in mind that the quality of dried fish using different drying methods can not be the same , as such , the objective of this study is to investigate the toxic and essential elements of striped snakehead fish ( channa striata ) dried using osd and sds in cambodia .
solar drying system is recommended for healthier eating and longer shelf - life of dried striped snakehead fish .
ni and cu however demonstrated higher level in both the skin and flesh of the fish samples under the technique of solar - assisted drying compared to osd method .
as far as the skin samples are concerned , the nutritional trace elements were higher in the samples subjected to sds with concentration of between 3.41  ppb and 2,019.69  ppb compared to osd skin sample of within the range of 2.55  ppb to 1,550.55  ppb recorded for se , mn , ni , cu , cr , fe , mo , and mg as presented in table 4 .
the finding from this study is important because it demonstrated that the different method of fish drying can influence their elemental contents and it is recommended that the drying method using sds has proven to contain higher content of the nutritious trace elements compared to using the conventional open drying system .
