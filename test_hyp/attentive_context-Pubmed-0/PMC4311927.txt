we demonstrate that high - sensitivity photocurrent spectroscopy can be achieved on small - area organic photovoltaic devices with greater than six orders of magnitude dynamic range in the eqe spectra .
there are several factors that must be considered when evaluating performance of these devices , including scattering of light perpendicular to the direction of incidence , enhancement of absorption and radiative rates in near fields via the purcell effect , and photonic confinement of the propagating modes in the fully assembled device stack .
these methods can be used to understand the interactions between the plasmonic modes of sub - wavelength metal hole arrays and an organic absorber .
we have developed a set of small area , high - brightness spectroscopies that are appropriate for characterizing prototypes of light - harvesting devices utilizing plasmonic contact materials , for understanding the details of light - matter interactions in these systems .
the aim is both to enable rapid screening of test device structures and to design structures capable of providing specific physical insight into coupling between the device active area and the modes of the patterned metal film .
our primary interest in developing a set of rapid , high - sensitivity characterization tools capable of probing the influence of the perforated metal nanostructure , including pore size and pitch , as well as film thickness on the optical transmission modes , and ultimately the effect on solar cell performance .
