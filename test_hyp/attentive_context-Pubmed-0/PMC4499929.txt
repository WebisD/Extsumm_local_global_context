this article discusses the unusual case of a stent that became dislodged and migrated into the omental bursa . following this migration some time
was allowed to elapse , and the gastrotomy closed completely . since a simple endoscopic retrieval was no longer possible , a combined laparoscopic - endoscopic technique ( rendezvous technique ) was used instead , and the stent was successfully retrieved .
when possible an endoscopic approach should generally be attempted in all patients with pseudocysts , and for pancreatic fluid collections endoscopic transmural drainage is the treatment of choice .
when endoscopic retrieval fails a combined laparoscopic - endoscopic approach offers an alternative to open surgery .
endoscopic methods are among the most important and frequently employed means of treating pancreatic pseudocysts .
an additional advantage of the self - expandable metal stent is that the necrotic tissue contained within the cyst can be actively removed using an endoscope .
the choice of technique is likely best predicated by individual patient presentation and local expertise . with this endoscopy - laparoscopy combination ( rendezvous technique )
currently , endoscopic ultrasound - guided drainage is a safe and effective means of treating pancreatic fluid collections . compared with surgical or percutaneous drainage it is less invasive and results in lower mortality , costs , and hospitalization times .
