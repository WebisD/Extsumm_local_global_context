the purpose of our study is to define hpv detection in patients with osccs and to evaluate the detection of e6/e7 high - risk hpv mrna as a possible biomarker for posttreatment surveillance .
further analysis using the nuclisens easyq assay detected e6/e7 mrna expression from the five high - risk hpv types ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , and 45 ) in 4/45 of the total samples ( 8.9% ) ( 3 cases of oral tongue scc and 1 of the floor of the mouth ) .
was detected in 2 samples ( 1 case of scc of the oral tongue and 1 of the floor of the mouth ) and hpv 18 in 1 sample ( 1 case of oral tongue scc ) .
as far as the site - specific oscc is concerned , hpv 16 was detected in 3 out of 5 hpv dna positive oral cavity sccs ( 2 cases of oral tongue scc and 1 of floor of the mouth ) , while hpv 18 was found in 1 out of 5 hpv - infected oral cavity sccs ( 1 case of oral tongue scc ) , by the rna detection method .
