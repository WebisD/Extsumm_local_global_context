rats were randomized into five groups , including control and four resuscitation groups ( n = 6 per group ) .
, our study provides the important finding that early small - volume resuscitation with single small volumes of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 40 leads to renal - protective effects from the damage due to lps exposure .
lps caused marked decreases in sap , vmax , and vmin , and increased rvri ( p = 0.012 versus t0 ) ; effects of lps continuously worsened over time in group s ( p = 0.028 versus t0 and t1 ) .
the groups were designated as follows : ( 1 ) group c ( control group ) : 4  ml 0.9% saline / kg ; ( 2 ) group s ( saline group ) : lps 1  mg / kg + 4  ml 0.9% saline / kg ; ( 3 ) group hts : lps 1  mg / kg + 4  ml 7.5% hts / kg ; ( 4 ) group he s : lps 1  mg / kg + 4  ml hes / kg ; and ( 5 ) group hsh : lps 1  mg / kg + 4  ml hsh / kg . four kinds of resuscitation solutions at a dose of 4  ml / kg were administered at 30  min after intravenous injection of lps . and fluids were administered within 5  min according to . after performing systemic hemodynamic and renal blood flow measurements , rats were euthanized , blood was collected by cardiac puncture , and the kidneys were harvested .
