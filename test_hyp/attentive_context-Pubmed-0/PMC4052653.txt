a large number of studies have been carried out in different parts of the world to determine the prevalence of isthmus in mandibular molars , ranging from 54 to 89% [ table 1 ] . considering ethnical variations and inadequate published data on this anatomical feature , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and location of isthmus in the mesial roots of extracted mandibular molars in an iranian population .
isthmuses are very common in the mesial roots of mandibular permanent molars in the iranian population , with the highest prevalence in those at 6 mm distance from the root apex .
in this cross - sectional descriptive study , 60 extracted mandibular first and second molars were randomly selected from dental clinics of tehran ( from the north , south , east , and west regions ) .
therefore , endodontic microscopes and newer technologies should be used for cleaning and obturation of isthmuses to achieve higher success rates in endodontic treatment .
the highest prevalence of isthmus was found at a distance of 6 mm from the apex with 92% [ confidence interval ( ci ) : 89.8 - 93.6 ] ; the lowest prevalence was found at a distance of 2 mm from the apex with 70% ( ci : 64.7 - 75.3 ) .
