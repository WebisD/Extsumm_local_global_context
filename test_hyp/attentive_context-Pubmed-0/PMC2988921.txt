early thrombolytic therapy can not always induce complete thrombolysis , and even if intestinal necrosis is avoided by administration of initial thrombolytic therapy , indications for additional thrombolytic therapy or the method for monitoring intestinal viability during subsequent follow - up have not been established . in this report , we present a case of acute sma occlusion diagnosed early after onset that was successfully treated by sequential and intermittent thrombolytic therapy by intraarterial urokinase infusion with angiographic evaluation of blood flow , thereby avoiding intestinal resection .
acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) causes extensive intestinal necrosis due to the difficulty of early diagnosis , resulting in poor prognosis , with a high postoperative mortality rate of 65.2% .
an 82-year - old woman with a past history of atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital , complaining of acute epigastric pain and stool with fresh blood .
recent reports indicate that selective thrombolytic therapy with intraarterial infusion of urokinase is effective for acute sma occlusion diagnosed early after onset .
sequential and intermittent thrombolytic therapy with meticulous angiographic evaluation of blood flow is effective in the early stage of acute sma . in particular , it is much less invasive than strategies described in previous reports and enables accurate evaluation of intestinal blood flow or viability over the time course .
