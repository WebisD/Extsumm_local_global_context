it is due to hormonal change , they are prone for endogenous infections like candidiasis and mixed infections.(14 ) this is in accordance with maitra et al . , where 1 out of 4 pregnant women had rti , with abnormal vaginal discharge being common symptom followed by pain during urination.(13 ) hence the study highlights the need for community - based studies requiring laboratory investigations with feasible tests to know the exact prevalence of the disease , as the self - reported morbidity alone can not measure the burden of any disease in the community to necessitate proper prevention and control measures .
distribution of women according to rti symptoms table 1 shows that a majority of women , 215 ( 32.7% ) , complained of abnormal vaginal discharge followed by lower backache in 206 ( 31.4% ) and lower abdominal pain in 154 ( 23.5% ) women ( n=656 ) .
married women ( 43% ) had more rti compared to unmarried and divorced / separated women ( p<0.001 ) ; similarly the prevalence of rti increased with relation to married life from < 1 year ( 30.4% ) to > 5 years ( 51.75% ) [ table 4 ] .
