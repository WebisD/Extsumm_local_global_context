we report two cases of malleostapedotomy performed in patients with hearing loss due to congenital anomalies of the oval window .
congenital anomalies of the oval window are due to malformations of the second branchial arch , in which there is not a full connection between the stapes and otic capsule , thereby preventing the oval window from being formed normally.1 ) congenital anomalies of the oval window have been reported in 0.5 - 1.2% of children with conductive hearing loss.2 ) various treatments for this anomaly have been introduced : hearing aids,3,4 ) vestibulotomy,5 ) fenestration of the horizontal semicircular canal,6,7 ) and formation of a neo - oval window.8 ) also , as fisch9 ) reported , incudostapedotomy and malleostapedotomy have been used successfully to treat patients with congenital oval window anomalies.10 ) however , in patients with accompanying malformations of the ossicles or abnormal routes of the facial nerve , the hearing improvement with previous procedures has not been sufficient . in our institute , instead of incudostapedotomy , we have performed malleostapedotomy , a safe and effective procedure for patients with oval window anomalies with accompanying ossicular malformations or facial nerve abnormalities . here ,
malleostapedotomy has the potential to replace previous procedures and is safe and effective in patients with congenital oval window anomalies .
