the data on outcome of ifis in children with t1d is scarce and is almost 
 confined to invasive zygomycosis ( 4 ) . with an aim to 
 determine the clinical spectrum and final outcome of children diagnosed with t1d and ifi 
 over the last decade at our hospital , we performed a retrospective review of their medical 
 records .
the analysis of hospital data of patients with t1d diagnosed to have a confirmed ifi was 
 conducted at advanced pediatrics center of our institute which is a tertiary care referral 
 center located in northwest india and included the period from march , 2004 to february , 
 2014 .
rapid and accurate diagnosis of ifis in children with t1d and a multimodal 
 management approach involving early surgery , appropriate antifungal therapy and control of 
 hyperglycemic state is successful in achieving a good outcome . to the best of our knowledge , 

sinusitis involved ethmoid sinus in 5 patients 
 and maxillary and frontal sinuses in 4 patients each ( table 1table 1clinical and 
 laboratory profiles , treatment modalities and outcome of the study 
 cohort ) .
data related to the basic demographic 
 profile , age at the time of diagnosis , mode of initial presentation like diabetic 
 ketoacidosis ( dka ) , imaging details , treatment modalities , duration of hospitalization and 
 the final outcome were noted .
