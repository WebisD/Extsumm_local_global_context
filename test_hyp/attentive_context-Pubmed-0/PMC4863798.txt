we present a patient with acf from rupture of abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm , which had a chronic course of disease .
aortocaval fistula ( acf ) mostly results from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm ( raaa ) , with a reported overall prevalence of 2% to 6% in patients with raaa .
diagnosis of this patient was delayed , but he fortunately had a successful operation and recovered finally . despite his poor general status and the high mortality associated with this condition , his complete recovery presents the potential for recovery with appropriate treatment .
evar was successfully performed for this patient , without endoleak and fistula at the follow - up .
however , no patients with abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm rupturing into inferior vena cava ( ivc ) have been reported , and there is also no standard therapy for this condition . because morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics of dissection are different from abdominal aortic aneurysm ( aaa ) , evar may be a more valid alternative over or in these patients .
the diagnosis is usually delayed , which increases the difficulties in treatment . both conventional open repair ( or ) and endovascular aneurysm repair ( evar ) have been used to treat this condition .
