in this study , 44 us hospitals collected non - duplicate , non - urine escherichia coli ( n  =  1306 ) and klebsiella pneumoniae ( n  =  1205 ) over the period of june 2013 and october 2014 .
extended spectrum -lactamases ( esbl ) are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing penicillins , broad - spectrum cephalosporins , and monobactams .
the purpose of this study was to compare the impact of mic - based screening versus confirmatory testing of esbls on the susceptibility profile of c / t versus selected antimicrobials .
these infections increase cost of care if inappropriate therapy , defined as non - susceptibility of pathogen to therapy by laboratory criteria , is administered . at present , the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( eucast ) do not recommend routine screening for esbls or subsequent phenotypic confirmation testing that had been advocated previously   . while this approach has been supported in the clinical practice setting by the introduction of reduced breakpoints for many beta - lactams , it may be of value , particularly when evaluating novel therapies , to understand the potency of various agents against esbl producers
