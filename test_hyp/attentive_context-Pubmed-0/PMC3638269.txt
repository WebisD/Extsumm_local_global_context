the usefulness of em neuronavigation is described with the review for the neuroendoscopic surgery in 11 pediatric surgical cases in one institute .
between jan . 2007 and jul . 2011 , nine pediatric patients ( 8 boys and 1 girl ) were managed with endoscopic surgery using pinless em neuronavigation ( axiem , medtronics , usa ) .
, it can be a useful device and alternative to a classical optical neuronavigation in the pediatric neuroendoscopic surgery .
the neuronavigation had proven to be a great device for the surgical treatment of variable neurosurgical problems such as tumor resection or biopsy , the surgery for epilepsy , vascular neurosurgery , the localization of functional and eloquent area , spinal neurosurgery and the operation for hydrocephalus9,13,16,17 ) .
the imaging study for postoperative status and follow - up showed the improvement and the stabilization of the lesion in 7 cases . in 2 cases ,
the appliance of the neuronavigation reduces the complication rate and enhances for the indication of the neuroendoscopic surgery . but the use of classical optical neuronavigation which needs rigid pinning fixations has been limited in several situations such as pediatrics with immature skull .
the pinless electromagnetic ( em ) image - guided neuronavigation has expanded the application of neuronavigation in intracranial neurosurgery , because the other neuronavigation systems needed the rigid pinning cranial fixation , these techniques were not always suitable for very young patients13 ) .
