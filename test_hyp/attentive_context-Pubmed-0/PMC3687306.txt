results from this unique nationwide case - control study show that individuals with ad are more likely to have a history of medically treated diabetes than the older population in general and that the association is independent of cardiovascular diseases .
the association between diabetes and ad was similar in individuals with no history of cardiovascular diseases ( n = 23,086 , or 1.39   ) and those with cardiovascular diseases ( n = 33,100 , or 1.29   ) .
people with ad were more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes ( either type 1 or type 2 diabetes ) in the unadjusted analysis ( or 1.14 [ 95% ci 1.081.20 ] ) , and the association was strengthened after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases ( adjusted or 1.31   ) .
the associations were strengthened after adjusting for cardiovascular diseases ( pooled or 1.60   and 1.25   for midlife and late life , respectively ) .
midlife diabetes was more strongly associated with ad than diabetes diagnosed in late life ( crude or 1.42 [ 95% ci 1.281.60 ] and 1.05   for midlife and late - life diabetes , respectively ) .
in this nationwide case - control study , people with clinically verified ad were more likely to have a history of clinically verified and medically treated diabetes than the general aged population .
