a healthy joint requires a fine - tuned balance between molecular signals regulating homeostasis , damage , restoration , and remodelling .
the aim of this review was to analyze systematically the available evidence on the clinical application of this biological approach for the injective treatment of cartilage lesions and joint degeneration , together with preclinical studies to support the rationale for this use of platelet concentrates , to shed some light and give indications on what to treat and what to expect from intra - articular injections of prp .
prp is a fashionable treatment , offering the possibility to deliver a high concentration of autologous growth factors and bioactive molecules in physiologic proportions , with low costs and in a minimally invasive way .
all in vitro , in vivo preclinical and clinical studies on prp injective treatment in the english language concerning the effect of prp on cartilage , synovial tissue , and menisci were considered . since
this explains the wide application of this blood derivative to several tissues and heterogeneous pathologies in different fields of medicine .
however , besides the increasing interest both among physicians and the scientific community , results are sometimes contradictory with no clear treatment indications , due to low - level clinical studies and the lack of understanding on the mechanism of action of this blood derivative .
