we present an interdisciplinary case report in which a tumor of the stomach , suspicious for gist , was removed surgically and was found to be a benign glomus tumor by definitive histology .
in such a case , the single remaining diagnostic option is a curative laparoscopic endoscopically - assisted wedge - resection of the stomach .
a 44-year old patient presented with relapsing epigastric pain of variable intensity and tarry stool , beginning three days earlier .
glomus tumor is a ( quite ) rare neoplasm and despite local invasion of vessels is mostly benign .
first - line procedural investigations for non - specific epigastric pain include endoscopy and endosonography , combined with biopsy of suspicious areas in the upper gastrointestinal tract . despite high sensitivity and specifity , obtaining a definite histopathologic differentiation
histological section of the surgical specimen revealed a rare benign glomus tumor ( positive reaction on markers specific for glomus tumor ( vimentin / actin ) , fig .
presented , a patient with recurring epigastric pain and melaena , there was an endoscopic and endosonographic finding of a submucosal tumor of the gastric antrum .
investigations thus far were inadequate to exclude a malignant process , and surgery ( endoscopically - assisted laparoscopic wedge - resection of the stomach ) was indicated .
