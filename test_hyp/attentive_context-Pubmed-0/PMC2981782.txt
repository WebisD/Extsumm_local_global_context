the distally based sural flap and lateral supramalleolar flap provide effective coverage of variable sized soft tissue defects on the foot after wide excision of malignant melanoma , this is quick and safe surgery without the necessity of microsurgical expertise , it preserves the major arteries of the leg and the donor - site morbidity is acceptable .
we enrolled 13 consecutive patients between march 2005 and march 2009 and who met the following inclusion criteria : 1 ) they were diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma by punch biopsy ; 2 ) their skin lesion confined to the foot ; 3 ) there was no skin or soft tissue disease on the ipsilateral lower leg .
our delayed full thickness skin graft had benefits with respect to confirming the flap 's viability in a critical period , the one - time - approach for ipsilateral lymph node dissection after harvesting the full thickness skin and the safety for the pedicle tunnel that remained open rather than performing primary closure . in conclusion ,
the distally based sural flap is useful for the hindfoot , and the lateral supramalleolar flap is good for lateral archs of the mid- and forefoot .
