the health benefits associated with fiber effects in the large bowel ( eg , relief from constipation , diarrhea , ibs ) are derived from 2 mechanisms : an insoluble fiber provides a mechanical stimulus proportional to particle size ( eg , wheat bran  softens hard stool in constipation but can exacerbate diarrhea and ibs ) , whereas a soluble , nonfermented gel - forming fiber retains its high water - holding capacity throughout the large bowel to provide a stool normalizing effect ( ie , psyllium  softens hard stool in constipation , firms loose / liquid stool in diarrhea , normalizes stool form in ibs ) . when recommending a fiber supplement , only a soluble nonfermenting , gel - forming fiber has been clinically proven to provide all of the health benefits typically associated with a fiber supplement
the health benefits associated with fiber effects in the small bowel ( eg , cholesterol lowering , improved glycemic control ) are a gel - dependent phenomenon , and the degree of benefit is proportional to the viscosity of the gelling fiber . as described in part 2 of this series ,
it is important to recognize the difference between replacement with dietary fiber that is intrinsic and intact in whole foods and a supplement with an isolated fiber source .
