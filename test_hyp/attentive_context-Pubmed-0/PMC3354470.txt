lutembacher 's syndrome refers to a congenital atrial septal defect ( asd ) complicated by acquired mitral stenosis ( ms ) .
it comprises of atrial septal defect ( asd ) [ ostium secundum ] with mitral stenosis ( ms ) .
if defect is in the formation of septum primium - it leads to the formation of asd ( primium ) and if defect is in the formation of septum secundum it forms asd ( secundum ) . here
, we will discuss about a lady who was diagnozed as having lutembacher 's syndrome during her pregnancy for the first time .
if patient is diagnosed at late stage , pulmonary hypertension and heart failure develops and the prognosis is bad . if the patient is diagnozed earlier before the development of pulmonary hypertension and heart failure , - asd closure with mitral valve replacement bears a good prognosis and prolongs survival .
a 22 year old female was referred krishna hospital as an unregistered case from a private maternity hospital in advanced pre - term labour .
the presence of ms , especially when accompanied by mitral regurgitation , increases susceptibility to infective endocarditis , in contrast to the low incidence of infective endocarditis in uncomplicated asd , just like in our case . early diagnosis and surgical treatment bears a good prognostic value .
