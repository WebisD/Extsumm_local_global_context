the difficulty in making the correct diagnosis because of the multitude of coinfections and comorbidities in the hiv population led the authors to a first erroneous diagnosis almost compromising the results of treatment . this experience is discussed further in the text .
we again emphasize that studies on osteoarticular changes ( such as bone density , muscular mass , joint mechanics , and cartilage loading ) induced by chronic hiv infection need to be conducted , to epidemiologically define this population better and diminish the frequency of erroneous diagnoses among patients with hiv / aids .
a care and study group called the  bone - hiv  group was created in our hospital to assist patients with hiv / aids presenting any orthopedic complaint .
the patient wpo , from the city of so paulo ( brazil ) , a 75-year - old caucasian male , had been receiving antiretroviral treatment in hospital das clnicas of so paulo , since being diagnosed with hiv 12 years earlier ( now taking lamivudine , tenofovir , atazanavir , and ritonavir for the last three years ) .
since there have been sporadic reports of abnormalities of hoffa 's fat among such patients , along with the nonspecific presentation of the condition in our patient , we were led to believe that his condition could have been related to hiv .
