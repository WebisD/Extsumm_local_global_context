germicidal cleansing of external port connections and gas filtration to pre - condition all gases prior to intra - abdominal instillation are preferred methods to reduce microbe exposure from a laparoscopic gas insufflation system .
this study examines the co2 laparoscopic insufflation gas delivery system and qualitatively evaluates it for the presence of bacteria and fungi .
these circumstances , coupled with these qualitative findings of bacterial and fungal colonization found within the laparoscopic gas delivery system , are fair warning and should raise our awareness to this circumstance and warrant methods to decrease or eliminate this exposure .
inorganic particulate contamination by carbon dioxide ( co2 ) insufflation apparatus and gas delivery systems for laparoscopy was first identified in 1989 .
a pressure - reducing insufflation ( throttling ) system delivers the gas to the abdomen .
due to longer and more complex laparoscopic procedures being performed on patients compromised by age and surgical disease processes compounded by pre - existing medical conditions , surgical margins of safety can be reduced .
it is not surprising that the external surfaces of the insufflation apparatus , pin index system , intake and exit ports showed the presence of microbes ( column 6 ) .
