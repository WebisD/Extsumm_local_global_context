we provide here a short overview of different forms of neuroplasticity with reference to the history of their discovery .

 the term  neuronal plasticity  was already used by the  father of neuroscience  santiago ramn y cajal ( 1852 - 1934 ) who described nonpathological changes in the structure of adult brains .
accordingly ,  neuronal plasticity  can stand not only for morphological changes in brain areas , for alterations in neuronal networks including changes in neuronal connectivity as well as the generation of new neurons ( neurogenesis ) , but also for neurobiochemical changes .
old dogma  that there is a fixed number of neurons in the adult brain that can not be replaced when the cells die ( for review see ) . in a wider sense ,
the obvious differences between chronic stress and chronic glucocorticoid treatment must be kept in mind because they possibly reflect different cellular pathways activated by the two treatments .
the ability to make adaptive changes related to the structure and function of the nervous system  .
these results indicate a site and treatment specific reaction to stress and glucocorticoid treatment in the hippocampal formation .
since glucocorticoid hormones are often regarded as important factors that convey many effects of chronic stress , it was tested whether a chronic cortisol treatment would have the same effects on the chromatin as the chronic social stress .
