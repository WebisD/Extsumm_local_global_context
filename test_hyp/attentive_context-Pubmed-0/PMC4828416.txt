the main - stay therapy for this condition is chronic oral anticoagulation , however , in patients with a high bleeding risk profile or prior life - threatening bleed , conventional therapy may not be ideal . new advanced technologies such as transcatheter closure of the left atrial ( la ) appendage ( laa ) provides clinicians an alternative therapy to reduce the stroke risk in patients with contraindications to chronic oral anticoagulation . in this case , we present a 66-year - old male with chronic af who underwent laa closure and was found to have a large thrombus attached to the device a year later .
, thrombosis might be a possible late complication and information to guide imaging monitoring and treatment is lacking .
this case is valuable for dealing with thrombus formation even after one year device closure .
several studies of the percutaneous transcatheter delivery of dedicated laa occlusion devices have shown promising results that offer an alternative to warfarin therapy for selected patients . despite the encouraging results of several studies about the procedure , additional studies are needed to verify the safety and effectiveness of the devices . as in the present case
