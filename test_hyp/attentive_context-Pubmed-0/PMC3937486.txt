cutaneous crohn 's disease ( ccd ) is synonymous with metastatic crohn 's disease ( mcd ) .
crohn 's disease , first described in 1922 , is characterized by segmental granulomatous inflammation of the intestinal tract that frequently involves the cutaneous tissues as well .
a 20-year - old woman , mother of a 1.5-year - old child , presented with a swelling in the genitalia of 6 months duration .
she was advised frequent reviews by the gastroenterologist to help in early identification of gastrointestinal involvement and complications and its management , but she was lost to follow - up ; however , she resurfaced 2 years later with another child of 3 months age and no specific complications except for the massive swelling of the labia majora .
it is in these cases that making a correct diagnosis becomes difficult , as was the experience of the present authors , who also missed the correct clinical diagnosis initially .
ccd is relatively rare with fewer than 100 cases reported in the literature . two - thirds of the patients were women with a mean age of onset at 34.5 years , though our patient had lesions much earlier at 20 years of age .
