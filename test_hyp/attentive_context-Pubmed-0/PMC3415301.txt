modulus was computed as the slope of the stress - strain plot , determined by regression to the linear portion of the curve . for biochemical analyses ,
mscs were isolated from femoral and tibial bone marrow of 3 - 6 month old calves and expanded to passage 2 as described previously .
after two hours further incubation , samples were transferred to chemically defined media ( dmem , 0.1m dexamethasone , 40 g / ml lproline , 100 g / ml sodium pyruvate , 1% insulin , transferrin , selenium / premix , and 1% penicillin , streptomycin and fungizone supplemented with 10 ng / ml transforming growth factor 3 ) . media was replaced twice weekly for the duration of the study . after measuring cross - sectional area using a custom laser device , samples ( n=5 ) were clamped with serrated grips and loaded into an instron 5542 testing device .
all testing was performed in a pbs bath . the mechanical testing protocol consisted of : ( 1 ) a nominal tare load of 0.1n applied at 0.1% strain / sec , followed by stress relaxation for 5 minutes , ( 2 ) 15 preconditioning cycles to 0.1% strain at 0.05% strain / sec , and ( 3 ) a quasi - static elongation at 0.1% strain / sec until failure .
