the aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of severe rop requiring laser treatment and the overall incidence of rop , and to evaluate the risk factors for developing severe rop requiring laser treatment in elbw infants in turkey .
in the present study , the severity of rop was inversely correlated with birth weight and gestational age at birth , and positively correlated with culture - proven sepsis and blood transfusion .
this retrospective , case - control study included preterm infants that presented to the rop screening , treatment , and training center , department of ophthalmology , etlik zubeyde hanim maternity and women s health research hospital , turkey , between january 2010 and april 2013 .
mean birth weight and gestational age in these patients were 816.33110.68 g ( range : 5701000 g ) and 26.281.65 weeks ( range : 2332 ) , respectively , and the male - to - female ratio was 1.04 ( 44/42 ) .
the severity of rop was inversely related to gestational age at birth ( p=0.008 ) and gestational weight at birth ( p=0.011 ) , based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses . because gestational age at birth decreased , the duration of assisted ventilation and the likelihood of development of severe rop increased .
