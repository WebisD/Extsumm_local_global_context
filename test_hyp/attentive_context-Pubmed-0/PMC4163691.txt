after all conventional methods of reversing the visual loss in our patient had failed , we resorted to a therapeutic trial of dabigatran etexilate , and the results are reported here .
a 46-year - old caucasian female underwent ppv of the right eye with endolaser treatment and c2f6 ( hexafluoroethane ) gas tamponade as per the current guidelines   for retinal detachment .
pars plana vitrectomy ( ppv ) is a proven and basically safe procedure with a low incidence of complications   . however , serious adverse events can and do occur , the most serious complications being endophthalmitis , hemorrhages and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( naion ) , a potentially blinding condition .
therefore , the striking improvement of vision after the administration of dabigatran etexilate in the present case may warrant a systematic clinical trial of a combination of corticosteroids and dabigatran etexilate in comparison with ( for instance ) warfarin as is common practice under different indications for anticoagulation   . however , when ophthalmologists consider the administration of dabigatran etexilate for naion , certain peculiarities and disadvantages of the drug ( such as the lack of an antidote   ) need to be borne in mind to avoid potential hazards .
