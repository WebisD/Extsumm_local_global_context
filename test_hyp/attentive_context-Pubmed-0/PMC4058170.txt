, we assume that , for example , an improvement of short - term storage of sublexical phonological material and , as a result of this , improved temporal sequencing possibly represent one essential prerequisite for improvements of speech motor but also language capabilities .
our current study aims at investigating how the above - mentioned rhythmic - melodic voice training influences brain activation in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia and concomitant aos .
functional reintegration of this region is mentioned in the literature in connection with language improvement   . although patients of our study are already in the chronic stage and have large lesions , they improved significantly with regard to language but also speech motor capabilities .
if it was possible to activate left - hemisphere language - related areas , as our imaging data with healthy subjects suggest , this might point to specific processes of reorganization , for example , improved temporal sequencing of sublexical speech components .

 functional imaging studies investigating therapy - induced recovery from aphasia after left - hemisphere stroke are rare ( for review see ) .
the major objective of this pilot study was to investigate how this training influences brain activation in three patients with severe chronic nonfluent aphasia and aos ( 1 broca 's , 2 global aphasia patients ) . before and after therapy each patient underwent the same fmri procedure as 30 control subjects in our prestudy . to determine how neural activity differed before and after therapy
