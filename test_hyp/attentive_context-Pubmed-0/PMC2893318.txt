a 41-year - old woman with a history of liver cirrhosis presented with recurrent portal hypertension and bleeding from esophageal varices .
, we have reported on a rare case of using the transsplenic approach for recanalization of a tips stent by thrombolysis .
however , residual thrombosis of the stent was noted in combination with occlusion of the hepatic vein ( fig .
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is now considered the procedure of choice for accessing the portal system for management of refractory variceal bleeding .
she is doing well five months after discharge and an ultrasound study indicates that the stent remains patent .
transsplenic entry to the portal system is useful in recanalizing a stent that is difficult to reach through the usual transjugular route .
we prescribe anticoagulation for only the patients with tips dysfunction ; however , there is no reference available for the effectiveness of this regime . as a general rule for preventing thromboembolism , chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin k antagonist
therefore , a percutaneous transsplenic approach guided by ultrasound was used to gain entry to the splenic vein and portal vein for catheterization of the occluded stent . to perform the
