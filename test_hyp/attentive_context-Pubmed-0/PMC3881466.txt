therefore , the present study compared the muscle activity of the upper trapezius with those 
 of the serratus anterior , and the lower trapezius when slings , unstable surfaces , were 
 laterally vibrated , to examine the effects of vibration during sling exercises on the 
 shoulder stabilization muscles .
the 
 subject performed push - up exercises on an unstable surface ( sling ) and maintained isometric 
 contraction for five seconds in a state of scapular protraction and elbow extension , in the 
 final stage of the motion , and emg signals from the serratus anterior , the upper trapezius 
 muscle , and the lower trapezius muscle were collected during state of isometric contraction . 
 in the second exercise ,
the subject performed push - up exercises on a sling and maintained 
 isometric contraction in the last stage , and the rope of the sling was manually vibrated 
 during the isometric contraction .
therefore , as the vibration frequency increased , making the 
 bearing surface more unstable , the recruitment of the upper trapezius , the lower trapezius , 
 and the serratus anterior increased . to perform exercises that will selectively strengthen 
 the serratus anterior ,
the upper trapezius and the lower trapezius did not show any significant differences among 
 isometric contraction without vibration , isometric contraction with vibration of 1  hz , and 
 isometric contraction with vibration of 3  hz , but showed significant differences at 
 isometric contraction with vibrations of 3.5  hz . the serratus anterior showed a significant 
 differences between isometric contraction with vibration of 3  hz and isometric contraction 
 with vibration of 3.5  hz ( table 1table 1 .
