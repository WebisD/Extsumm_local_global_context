the results of the urine analysis showed no signs of toxicity in the urine ; the parameters being within the normal range ; creatinine , ph , color , quantity of urine . however , pus cells , sperms , bacteria , and ketone bodies were found , but rarely .
values are expressed as means  sems ( number of animals , n = 6 ) and were ; significantly different at p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 , and p < 0.001 , when compared with the control group .
slight variations were observed in parameters such as glucose ( glu ) , urea , sgpt , sgot in the 1,000 mg / kg of body weight dose group , but the values were in the normal range ( tables 3,4 ) .
the pi extract is seen to have had no , toxic effect on any of the observed blood parameters , wbc , rbc , hb , hct , mch , mchc , plt and lymp , for the different dose levels .
higher doses of the pi extract , i.e. 500 and 1,000 mg / kg of body weight , both caused increase in the sgpt and the sgot levels , but these increases did not take the levels outside the normal range .
