the results indicate that addition of fosaprepitant to morphine can delay morphine tolerance for a limited period of time .
co - administration of fosaprepitant possibly interfered with the binding of sp to the nk1rs expressed by postsynaptic neurons in the spinal cord .
the results of this study show that combining morphine with fosaprepitant ( group iv ) delayed the development of morphine tolerance and concurrently increased the antinociceptive effect compared to the control group . as mentioned earlier , this could be due to decreased binding of sp to the nk1r .
expression of both substance p and calcitonin gene - related peptide was noted over the superficial laminae ( i - ii ) .
each group had 6 animals quantitative image analysis of the expression of substance p and calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) shows that morphine + fosaprepitant treatment led to higher substance p expression compared to all other groups including the morphine treated group . p
rats were divided into 4 equal groups and injected physiological saline ( twice daily subcutaneously in morning and evening ; group i ) , morphine sulfate ( 10 mg / kg twice daily subcutaneously ; group ii ) , fosaprepitant ( 30 mg / kg once by intraperitoneal route ; group iii ) , and finally , the last group was co - administered both morphine and fosaprepitant ( group iv ) in the same doses as in group ii and iii , respectively , for a week . in the last group , fosaprepitant was injected 30 min before the morphine injection . the dose of fosaprepitant ( 30 mg / kg ) was higher than that used in an earlier study ( 25 mg / kg ) .
