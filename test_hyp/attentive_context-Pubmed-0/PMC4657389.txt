accordingly , a ctti work group ( the expert interviews team ) conducted interviews and analyzed information from 25 highly experienced observers of the informed consent process who represented multiple sectors of the us clinical trial enterprise .
initial project activities revealed that although an extensive body of literature on informed consent exists , there is little published information examining the observations and recommendations of experts with long - standing experience with the informed consent process .
while we recognize that modifying the informed consent process is a complex policy issue , our findings from interviews of a diverse group of experts not only solidify the recognition of major problems that require reform but also provide a framework for meaningful change at both the local and national levels .
informed consent is an essential element of ethical biomedical research , with federal regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure autonomy of the research participant s decision to engage in research after a balanced discussion .
interviews were conducted by the center for information and study on clinical research participation ( ciscrp ) between april and june 2014 .
although this led some to expect that revision of human subjects protection regulations was imminent , major reform has yet to occur . recognizing deficiencies in the current informed consent process , the clinical trials transformation initiative ( ctti ) launched the informed consent project .
