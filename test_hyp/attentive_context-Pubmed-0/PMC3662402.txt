however here we show through a combination of experimental ( nmr spectroscopic , x - ray crystallographic ) and theoretical ( dft ) studies that working co - operatively in a molecular mixed - metal system , an alkali metal ( lithium or sodium ) and zinc can bring about such transformations under challenging redox - inactive conditions .
conversions of saturated diamines into unsaturated diazaethenes are usually associated with redox - amenable transition metal catalysts .
the synthesis of this complex from the fully saturated ( ipr)nhch2ch2nh(ipr ) ( diisopropylethylenediamine ) 2 ( scheme 1 ) displayed a new mode of hydrogen activation previously unseen within zincate chemistry .
recently our own group has started to investigate the use of diamines in a bimetallic context , reporting in a communication the synthesis of the diazaethene zincate complex ( tmeda)li[(ipr)nch = chn(ipr)]zn(tbu ) 1 .
the combination of an alkali metal with a range of different subordinates ( i.e. , metals that would be expected to be less reactive than the alkali metals - zn , mg , mn , cr , fe , cu , cd , al ) have been integrated with a diverse array of ligands ( alkyl , amido , alkoxy , halide ) and have been efficiently deployed in both ethereal and hydrocarbon media to overcome some of the great challenges facing deprotonation chemistry such as the incapability to metalate low brnsted acidity substrates , lack of compatibility with sensitive functionalities , low selectivity and the need to perform reactions under cryogenic conditions .
