growing evidence suggests that either impaired or deficient leptin signaling results in the development of insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism ( 1,46,25 ) . here , we report that leptin deficiency also contributes to the development of progressive insulin resistance and associated neuroendocrine derangements in udm .
we found that systemic administration of exogenous leptin at a dose that maintains normal physiologic plasma leptin levels prevented the development of severe , progressive insulin resistance in rats with udm and that this effect could not be explained by leptin - induced changes in food intake or body weight .
although reduced food intake might also be expected to contribute to the insulin - sensitizing effects of leptin , this possibility is inconsistent with our finding that diabetic animals pair fed to the intake of those receiving leptin failed to exhibit an improvement of insulin sensitivity . in light of the potent insulin - sensitizing effect of leptin replacement in rats with udm ,
in addition , physiologic leptin replacement in udm reduced body fat while sparing lean mass , attenuated the increased energy expenditure that accompanies udm ( 26 ) , and normalized elevated levels of plasma glucagon and corticosterone . taken together ,
