chromosomal heteromorphisms are interindividual variation of chromosomes without phenotypic consequences and are detected most frequently in 1q12 , 9q12 , 16q11.2 , yq12 and in the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes ( 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 and 22 ) . in some cases , the enlarged acrocentric p arms of p arm can mask a cryptic translocation and therefore a partial trisomy . here , we report a moroccan 1-year - old girl addressed for suspicion of trisomy 21 having an extremely enlarged p arm in one of her chromosomes 22 .
fish should always be used to resolve similar situations involving cytogenetic aberrations within the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes .
further follow - up of the propositus may allow us to have more clinical information and making some correlations between this heteromorphism and/or other genetic changes below the cytogenetic resolution and the phenotype of the patient .
this special here reported kind of chromosome 22 short arm enlargement , leading ro ~1.5 larger size than the normal  long arm 
cytogenetic and fish investigation of the propositus excluded ( cryptic ) trisomy 21 as already reported in down - syndrome like syndrome phenotypes .
instead of clarifying the genetic reason of the clinical problems in this specific case unexpectedly a familial 22ph+++ was detected and further characterized .
