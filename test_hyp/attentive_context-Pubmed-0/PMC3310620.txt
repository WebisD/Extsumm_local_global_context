a third and related possibility is that wnv infection may be less severe in persons with preexisting heterologous flavivirus antibodies ( 11 ) .
. a second reason may be the difficulty of making a serologic diagnosis of wnv infection among persons living in geographic regions where several different flaviviruses circulate , and people have multiple flavivirus infections ( 11 ) .
phylogenetic trees generated by a number of methods indicate that the recent mexican mosquito and human isolates belong to the clade comprised of wnv isolates collected outside the northeastern united states after 2001 , with the exception of isolates collected along the southeast coast of texas .
our patient represents the first reported autochthonous human case of confirmed wnv infection in mexico .
the mexican mosquito and human isolates reported herein shared a unique mutation at genomic position 1320 ( a to g ) in the e gene .
as illustrated by our patient , west nile fever can easily be mistaken for dengue fever
( those isolates constitute a separate , sister clade relative to all other north american wnv isolates sequenced to date [ figure ] . ) . because of a shared mutation between the recent mexican mosquito and human isolates ,
