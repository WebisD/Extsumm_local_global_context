sa-gal activity in dog is detectable through x - gal staining in situ ; use of x - gal staining reagents with higher ph ( 7.3 ) might help in detecting more specifically senescent cells than previously suggested ph ( 6 ) ; x - gal staining is possible with tissues collected immediately after death ; storage of tissues at -80c reduce sa-gal activity ; however , x - gal staining is still feasible in those frozen tissues ; x - gal staining of dog skin tissue has the potential to be explored as a marker of senescence or old age .
on the basis of the current study , following conclusions are made :
