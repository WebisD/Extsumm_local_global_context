we hope to tackle head - on the challenge of linking evolutionary models with mechanistic and physiological models .
the evolutionary unified failure theory of our aspiration would also need to incorporate elements of optimal life history , as well as accounting for the complex hierarchy of trade - offs , from the level of single genes and organelles up to ecosystems , and on timescales from the milliseconds of rna transcription to the millennia of evolutionary time . for our present , more modest , purposes the gamma family
trade - offs and impacts on age - specific mortality must be embodied in complex reliability structures . with the exception of pletcher and neuhauser ( 2000 ) , the mathematical development on both sides
one of the most familiar general predictions of the evolutionary theory of senescence is a positive relationship between the extrinsic mortality rate associated with unavoidable risks in natural settings such as predation and accidents that are present even the young and healthy , and the  rate of senescence  measured by the slope of the logarithm of the hazard rate with respect to age .
it remains , however , to develop comprehensive models in which the generic mutation accumulation machinery is driven by plausible genetic and physiological mechanisms , and in which age - specific tradeoffs are derived compellingly from reliability theory .
