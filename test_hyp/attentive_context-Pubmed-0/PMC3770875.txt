together with light and scanning electron microscopic evidences , we provided the identification key and measurements of various parts of the worm .
the purpose of this study , therefore , was to investigate parasitic diseases of wild boars in south korea . in this study
, we examined the gastrointestinal tract of 87 wild boars over a 4-year period in the southwestern part of south korea and found that b. diducta was quite prevalent among wild boars .
a total of 938 worms ( 551 males and 387 females ) of b. diducta was collected from the cecum and colon with an average number of 20.0 per animal and the infection intensity being the highest in animals from boseong - gun .
the bourgelatioides traguli differs from b. diducta in lacking the anterior leaf - crown and in other details of the mouth capsule , in the presence of a groove and overlying flaps in the cervical region , and in the presence of terminal convoluted filaments on the spicules .
from 87 korean wild boars captured from mountains of the suncheon - si , gwangyang - si and boseong - gun , south korea spanning 2009 to 2012 , the infection of b. diducta , with an average number of 20 worms per animal was confirmed in 47 ( 54% ) wild boars . although this is the first report in south korea ,
