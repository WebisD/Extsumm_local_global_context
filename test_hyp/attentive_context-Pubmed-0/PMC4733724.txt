, we performed a meta - analysis to investigate the effects of these polymorphisms on pd .
meta - analysis of the association between vdr gene polymorphism and pd or : odds ratio ; ci : confidence interval ; vdr : vitamin d receptor ; pd : parkinson s disease ; snp : single nucleotide polymorphism . subgroup analysis of the association between the vdr gene polymorphism and pd or : odds ratio ; ci : confidence interval ; vdr : vitamin d receptor ; pd : parkinson s disease ; snp : single nucleotide polymorphism .
data from our meta - analysis suggest that the apai , bsmi , and taqi gene polymorphisms are not significantly associated with pd while the foki ( c / t ) polymorphism may increase pd risk .
characteristics of the eligible studies snp : single nucleotide polymorphism ; pb : population - based ; hb : hospital - based ; hwe : hardy - weinberg equilibrium ; nos : newcastle - ottawa scale ; pcr - rflp : polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism .
a previous study suggested strong linkage disequilibrium for bsmi , apai , and taqi rflps , which may explain the high degree of consistency between these three polymorphisms and their link to pd susceptibility .
