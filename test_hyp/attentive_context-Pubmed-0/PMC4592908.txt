however , in methicillin - resistant s. aureus , increased expression of the msra1/msrb locus was apparent only when the bacterial cells were deficient in both msra1 and msrb .
in addition , sigb also in part downregulates the expression of this locus in methicillin - sensitive s. aureus but not in methicillin - resistant s. aureus .
overall , the expression of lacz was lower in methicillin - resistant s. aureus compared to the methicillin - sensitive s. aureus ( figures 1(b ) and 2(b ) ) .
previous studies have shown that the msra1/msrb locus is induced by the cell wall - active antibiotics , oxacillin , vancomycin , and d - cycloserine , in a methicillin - sensitive s. aureus strain . in a later study , while the msra1/msrb locus remained inducible in the presence of d - cycloserine and vancomycin , no induction of this locus was noted in the presence of oxacillin , when similar experiments were carried out in a methicillin - resistant s. aureus strain col .
previously created msra1 , msrb , msra1-msrb , and sigb knockout mutants of s. aureus strain sh1000   were transduced in the methicillin - resistant s. aureus strain col . these mutants and the presence of meca gene in these strains
