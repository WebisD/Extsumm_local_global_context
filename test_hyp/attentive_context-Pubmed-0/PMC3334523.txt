her neuroimaging profile was created using a palette of multiple modalities that provided correlated images of the brain at different levels of resolution .
the challenges in creating a comprehensive histological model of the human brain that matches the scope and usability of mri population - based templates , including the proposed connectome , are primarily logistical . to begin with ,
these methodological prerogatives are the basis for a novel neuroimaging resource that will be used to cross - reference different modalities and establish fundamental properties of brain structure at multiple scales .
because the main goal is to bridge the gap between non - invasive neuroimaging and histology it would be useful to have access to radiologic images acquired in vivo for each case that comes to autopsy . when comparisons are made between images from different modalities in the context of the same subject all the information necessary to localize and quantify microscopic features underlying the patterns revealed in mri images is available .
assuming that the necessity of enrolling a large enough number of brain donors has been addressed , noting that the benefits of such donor program can not be expected to roll out in the short - term , what pre - mortem information should characterize the specimen and how should the brain be processed in order to create images that can complement and validate mri studies ?
