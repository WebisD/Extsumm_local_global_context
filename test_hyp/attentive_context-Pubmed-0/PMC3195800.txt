it is known that in patients with ischemic heart disease , anxiety and depression are predictive of adverse short- and long - term outcomes   .
anxiety disorders and depression are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders . given the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general population and in patients with coronary heart disease [ chd ] , the potential public health impact for preventing the development and progression of chd by appreciating the nature of the relationship between anxiety , depression and chd is enormous .
thus , it is clinically relevant in patient with cardiovascular disease to assess the psychological profile and treat emotional conditions that confer an increase risk of major adverse cardiovascular events .
despite the large amount of evidence supporting significant and independent associations between anxiety and depression and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease , the 2010 american college of cardiology foundation / american heart association guideline for assessment of cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic adults   does not consider yet any of them .
this will require that cardiologists , cardiovascular surgeons and mental health professionals work together to provide comprehensive treatments that address not only chd but optimize the mental health of patients .
