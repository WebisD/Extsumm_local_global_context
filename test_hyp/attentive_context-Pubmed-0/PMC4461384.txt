therefore , we conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis of rcts to determine whether the use of epo in patients with critical illness or perioperative care could ameliorate the incidence of aki and assess its adverse event .
stratified analyses of studies with entirely perioperative care demonstrated no significant difference between the epo and control groups using a fixed effect model ( rr , 0.86 ; 95% ci , 0.661.12 ; p = 0.260 ; i = 33.9% ; p = 0.169).1218 among studies that excluded patients with prior epo use , similar result of rr was obtained ( rr , 0.89 ; 95% ci , 0.661.21 ; p = 0.467 ; i = 23.3% , p = 0.259).9,10,13,15,17,18 among patients who received at least 2 doses of epo911,15 or were at high risk of aki according to each study,11,14,16 the prevention of aki remained nonsignificant ( rr , 0.99 ; 95% ci , 0.731.35 ; p = 0.962 ; i = 44.3% , p = 0.145 and rr , 1.22 ; 95% ci , 0.891.67 ; p = 0.215 ; i
in summary , this meta - analysis , based on currently available rct evidence , suggests that prophylactic epo treatment of patients with critical illness or under perioperative care does not reduce the incidence of aki , dialysis requirement , or death .
