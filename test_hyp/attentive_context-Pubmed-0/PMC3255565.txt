this balance is accomplished by complex alteration of the innate and acquired immune response of the host where regulatory t ( tregs ) cells play an important role .
in summary , the field of infectious disease immunology is at an exciting intersection with new concepts in regulation of immune responsiveness . despite extensive studies
understanding the complex cellular and molecular mechanism that regulates the host immune response to parasitic infections still remains a key issue in immunology .
for an effective parasite survival , evasion of adaptive immunity remains the key . in this scenario ,
the ability of the treg cells to control many facets of the immune response makes them an interesting model to study possible immune - modulatory intervention .
a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and gene - expression pathways that underlie the treg activities will be essential if new therapeutic strategies    are to be developed .
in this paper , we specify parasites as eukaryotic pathogens that largely include protozoa and helminths and survive off their host partly or completely for their life cycle .
, there is still much that remains unclear about the mechanism and activities of treg .
innate immunity rarely eliminates parasites   but can successfully inhibit growth while they recruit antigen - specific t and b cells to differentiate into effector cells that thwart the infection .
