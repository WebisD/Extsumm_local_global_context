the protocol evaluated in this study has three distinct differences compared with prior research protocols : ( 1 ) the bleaching light intensity was significantly reduced to shorten the duration necessary to measure sensitivity recovery ; ( 2 ) the stimulus was located within the area of greatest rod dysfunction to enhance the sensitivity of the test for detection of early disease ; and ( 3 ) the speed of dark adaptation was estimated using a parameter that is robust to the shape of the dark adaptation function , which can be variable with disease severity .
the goal of this study was to develop a short - duration dark adaptation protocol that minimized patient fatigue , increased operator ease of use , and maintained the high sensitivity and specificity of research protocols .
the impaired night vision encountered in early arm is a clinically significant problem similar to acuity impairment encountered in late arm . as such
, we believe dark adaptation is a suitable primary endpoint to evaluate efficacy of treatments aimed at early arm .
the magnitude of the impairment was similar to that previously measured using a 90-minute research protocol . as expected , reducing the bleaching light shortened the duration of the test , and moving the stimulus to an area of greater rod dysfunction preserved the sensitivity and specificity of the protocol .
