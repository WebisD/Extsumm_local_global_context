this would be urgently needed as jcv infections of the nervous system including pml , jcv meningitis , and cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy become more clinically prominent .
if confirmed , the observed alterations in cd4 t cell subpopulations could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of pml and may ultimately represent a biomarker for pml disease activity or to detect patients at risk of pml development .
the development of pml is known to be associated with low total numbers of cd4 t cells in patients with late - stage hiv infections and patients with idiopathic cd4 t cell lymphopenia .
herein , we provide data indicating that alterations in the composition of peripheral cd4 helper t cell subpopulations are associated with development of pml .
cd4 t cells have a pivotal role in the defense against viral infections as has been shown in numerous human diseases including hiv , hepatitis c virus , and jcv .
this is consistent with the previously observed prominent infiltration of cd4 t cells into inflammatory cns lesions in pml and further supports the central role of cd4 rather than cd8 t cells in immune defense against jcv . before the diagnosis of pml ,
