overall , our analysis of the impact of baseline age on the effect of more intensive blood glucose lowering in the accord trial indicates that , relative to standard glycemic treatment , intensive treatment resulted in similar metabolic ( e.g. , attained a1c targets ) and primary and secondary end point effects in older and younger participants .
the purpose of the glycemic portion of the accord study was to determine whether randomization to an intensive therapeutic strategy targeting normal glycated hemoglobin levels ( i.e. , below 6.0% , 42 mmol / mol ) would reduce the rate of cardiovascular events , as compared with a standard strategy targeting glycated hemoglobin levels from 7.0 to 7.9% ( 5363 mmol / mol ) in people with type 2 diabetes .
the impact and tolerability of intensive management in older adults ( 65 years old ; specifically , 6589 years old ; n = 3,996 ) versus younger adults ( < 65 years old ; specifically , 4064 years old ; n = 6,255 ) on glucose control , severe hypoglycemia , severe adverse effects , the accord primary / secondary outcomes , and physical function ( activities of daily living and mobility ) are addressed herein . also addressed is the potentially modifying effect of age on the previously reported findings that 1 ) the highest risk in mortality among intensive participants occurred for participants with average postrandomization a1c > 7.0% ( 53 mmol / mol ) and 2 ) the increased mortality in the intensive arm was most apparent in those participants whose a1c levels fell less rapidly in the initial year of follow - up ( 20 ) .
