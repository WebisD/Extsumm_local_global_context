in summary , we found a borderline nonsignificant effect of wb - ems on bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and no effect at the hip .
we found a borderline significant effect ( p = 0.051 ) for the lumbar spine bmd , but not for the femoral neck site . in view of the high effects of wb - ems on muscle mass and strength in previous studies   and
differences between wb - ems and cg - group were borderline nonsignificant for ls - bmd ( p = 0.051 , es : d = 0.49 ) and not significant for bmd of the total hip roi ( p = 0.771 , es : d = 0.04 ) .
bmd at the ls increased in the wb - ems groups ( 0.6  2.5% ) and decreased in the cg ( 0.6  2.4% ) . at the total hip roi bmd decreased in both groups ( wb - ems : 0.9  1.9% versus cg : 1.0  2.3% ) .
this is the first trial that determined the effect of ( wb- ) ems on bmd at lumbar spine or / and proximal femur in elderly females with osteopenia .
