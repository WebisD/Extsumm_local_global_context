our data confirm the involvement of birds in the cycle of human tick - borne diseases .
the presence of anaplasma , borrelia , and rickettsia species in ticks removed from passerine birds corroborates the role of these vertebrates in the epidemiology and dispersion of tick - borne pathogens in spain and in other zones of the planet .
r. sibirica sibirica , responsible for siberian tick typhus in western people s republic of china and in siberia , was also amplified in an i. ricinus larva in this study .
candidatus rickettsia vini , a potential new rickettsia species , also detected in our study , has not been related to human disease ( 17 in technical appendix ) .
( figure ) . the phylogenetic position of candidatus rickettsia vini based on the ompa nucleotide sequences in a study of the role of birds in dispersal of etiologic agents of tick - borne zoonoses , spain , 2009 .
the presence of a. phagocytophilum in a larva in our study supports the role of birds as reservoirs of a. phagocytophilum .
in addition , these species share an ecologic niche and ectoparasites ( horizontal transmission ) with other migratory birds that cover long distances from africa to the eurasian region . except for i. arboricola , the tick species captured in this study previously had been found on birds in spain ( 18 in technical appendix ) .
