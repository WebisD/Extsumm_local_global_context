a new index , the ioftn , has been developed to help in the prioritization of severe malocclusions not amenable to orthodontic treatment alone . the index has face and content validity and has been shown to have good inter and moderate to good intra - operator reliability . as a result of being an evolution of the iotn ,
the index of orthognathic functional treatment need ( ioftn ) twenty - one specialist orthodontists with experience of orthognathic treatment , all consultant orthodontists and senior fttas were then asked to score the 163 sets of models using the new index , in order to test agreement with the expert panel scores .
the percentage agreement of the 21 assessors with the expert panel scores for all categories is illustrated in figure 2 and ranged from 681 to 92% .
using the iotn dhc as a starting point , four consultant orthodontists with extensive experience in treating orthognathic patients ( aji , sjc , mtc , nph ) devised a draft ioftn based on a five - point scale ranging from very great need for treatment ( 5 ) through to no need for treatment ( 1 ) .
this index was developed with the aim of prioritizing the functional need for treatment through its dental health component ( dhc ) and psychosocial need through the aesthetic component ( ac ) .
