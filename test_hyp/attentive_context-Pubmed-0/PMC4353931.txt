1 day  old male baby was referred for respiratory distress secondary to the presence of an oropharyngeal mass .

most of the congenital nasopharyngeal lesions present as an emergency respiratory problem and require immediate surgery .

teratoma is a special type of mixed tumor that contains recognizable mature or immature cells or tissues representative of more than one germ cell layer and sometimes all three .
histopathological examination showed the mass in our case to be composed of multiple mature tissues with no juvenile cells , which confirmed a benign tumor .
