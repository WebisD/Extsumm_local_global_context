we present a case in which tc-99 m mdp bone scintigraphy was utilized to raise concern for a serious abnormality despite relatively occult findings by conventional imaging modalities .
technetium-99 m ( tc-99 m ) in complex with methylene - diphosphonate ( mdp ) is a commonly used substrate in radionuclide bone imaging .
it is therefore important to utilize the patient 's medical history , in conjunction with other forms of imaging , to aid in differentiating potential pathologies . here ,
this case also underscores the importance of considering the bone scan findings in conjunction with the patient 's clinical history and anatomic imaging . by using all this information in combination
bone scans utilizing this radiotracer are very sensitive and enable nuclear medicine physicians to screen for various osseous abnormalities and pathologies .
this case demonstrated the value of tc-99 m mdp bone scintigraphy as an initial detector of bone abnormalities .
localization of the radiotracer is accomplished through the exchange of tc-99 m mdp for phosphate compounds during active bone remodeling , and aggregation is subsequently detected using a gamma camera . even though the utilization of tc-99 m mdp bone scintigraphy is useful for identifying various physiologic abnormalities , its overall specificity is limited primarily by the lack of anatomic detail .
