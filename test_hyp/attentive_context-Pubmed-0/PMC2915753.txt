due to the additional need for human models combined with the impossibility of conducting basic research in humans in vivo , the use of ips cells and neural stem cell cultures derived from human fetal and adult tissue is being established as an alternative and complementary route .
the animal models shed light on mechanisms of progression of tauopathies and their application as drug screening systems pave the way for the development of future treatments of dementia .
in summary , a variety of animal models have been generated which reproduce either the a or tau histopathological hallmark lesions of ad as well as transgenic animals which exhibit both features simultaneously .
this observation is strengthened by the notion that the transgenic mouse models most successfully reproducing ad - like pathology are the ones which combine overexpression of tau and app , like the 3xtg - ad mice .
some of these models reproduce the lesions as well as the related behavioral impairments , while suggesting that both plaques and tangles may have synergistic effects in driving the disorder rather than developing independently from each other .
while this approach does not hold the advantages of conserving the integrity of the biological system under study , they do allow the study of molecular interaction and biochemical pathways in an all - human system , a point of high relevance due to the human specificity of many aspects of ad .
