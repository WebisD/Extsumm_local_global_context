we performed constricting anterior and posterior colporrhaphy , levator myorrhaphy , and high perineorrhaphy with concurrent hysterectomy , and investigated the feasibility , intraoperative complications , and short - term follow - up results of these constricting procedures in 54 patients aged 75 years or older .
we performed constricting anterior and posterior colporrhaphy , levator myorrhaphy , and high perineorrhaphy with concurrent hysterectomy , and investigated the feasibility , intraoperative complications , and short - term follow - up results of these constricting procedures in 54 patients aged 75 years or older .
the mean follow - up time was 24.4 months after constricting surgery ( range : 8 to 44 months ) .
our results indicate that constricting anterior and posterior colporrhaphy , levator myorrhaphy , and high perineorrhaphy with concurrent hysterectomy , is a feasible , safe , and effective surgical option in elderly patients at low anesthesiological risk .
there was no significant difference between the study group and the nonresponders / nonagreement cohorts in terms of age , body mass index , parity , comorbidities , and stage of prolapse ( data not shown ) .
the patients mean ( sd ) age was 79.7 ( 2.6 ) years , the mean ( sd ) body mass index was 29.14 ( 3.16 ) kg / m , and the mean ( sd ) parity was 3.51 ( 1.55 ) .
