same procedure was followed with 3% and 5% of polymer for preparation of sustained release tablets .
the results indicated that the selected biopolymer had a good release retardant property thus it can be concluded that the selected biopolymer can be utilized as low cost natural biocompatible and biodegradable agent .
fine powder was collected as bio - polymer . for the granulation 1% , 3% and 5% solution of polymer
in - vitro release study for tablets prepared by using 5% conc . of polymer graph for cumulative % drug release vs time of rifampicin at ph ( 1.2 ) observation table for release study
the biopolymer from citrus limetta was isolated and evaluated for release retardant property in sustained release tablet . among the three formulations , fm-3 shows hardness of 5moh , friability of ( .90 ) , weight variation of ( 5.0 ) .
then granules were subjected to resize with sieve#16 . before compression of granules , 2%talc and 2% fine powder were mixed well . for the preparation of sustained release tablets containing rifampicin
the juice was extracted from the fruits and subjected to centrifuge . in the supernatant equal amount of ethanol
was made in distilled water and appropriate amount of lactose ( 10 gm ) was added to it .
