the aim of this study was to review the outcome of clavicle fractures in paediatric patients at our institute and to determine the number of such fractures that require operative management .
we retrospectively reviewed all clavicle fractures in children treated at our institute over a two - year period .
we used the agfa impax web1000 system to identify all radiographs of the shoulder region performed in children aged up to and including 15 years old .
further review appointments were arranged at the discretion of the clinician and were determined by clinical and/or radiographic assessment . the mean radiographic follow - up of the group as a whole was 35 days ( 5 weeks ) , and the mean clinical follow - up was 44 days ( 6.3 weeks ) .
we identified 487 clavicle fractures in 483 patients treated in our institute during the two - year period .
all paediatric clavicle fractures can be treated with simple immobilisation and analgesia , without development of complications .
one hundred and twenty - four fractures were undisplaced ( 65% ) and 66 were displaced ( 35% ) .
most published articles report these complications in adult patients , and there is a relative paucity of the literature available that is specifically reporting upon clavicle fractures in children .
