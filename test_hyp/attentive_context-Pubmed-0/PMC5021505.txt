in the present study , the experimental model of dss - induced colitis in balb / c mice was employed to explore the effects of hbo2 on the antioxidative enzymes , transcription factor hif-1 , and proinflammatory cytokine genes during colonic inflammation and their role in modulating the course of the disease via hbo2 treatment .
the most important findings are that ( a ) hbo2 significantly reduces symptoms and severity of dss - induced colitis , as evidenced by clinical appearance , contraction of the immune cell expansion and mobilization , and reversal of il-1 , il-2 , and il-6 gene expression ; ( b ) hbo2 modulates the expression of antioxidative enzyme genes and enzyme activities during colitis ; and ( c ) hbo2 enhances hif-1 mrna expression in the inflamed colonic tissue which is in a strong correlation with gpx1 , sod1 , and il-6 mrna expression .
a recent study revealed increased activity of antioxidative enzymes and reduced oxidative stress in the inflamed gut mucosa following hbo2 exposure ; however , specific mechanisms inducing activation of antioxidative enzymes in the inflamed colonic tissue upon hbo2 remain unknown . since there is evidence that the intracellular redox status is in a close correlation with the inflammatory microenvironment , and it can also be changed by hbo2 , the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hbo2 on the mrna expression of hif-1 , proinflammatory cytokines , and antioxidative enzymes in the gut and peripheral lymphoid organs of balb / c mice with dss - induced colitis . an additional aim was to assess the activity of antioxidative enzymes and whether hif-1 gene expression regulation during the gut inflammation and hbo2 treatment correlates with the changes in antioxidative and proinflammatory gene expression .
