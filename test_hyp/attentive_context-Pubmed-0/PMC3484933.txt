implantation of bioprostheses was associated with a 30-day - mortality of 3,3 % , which is higher than for mechanical valves ( 1,5% ) due to the fact that patients for bioprostheses are significantly older or suffer from more complex co - morbidities .  
there is the urgent need for complete nationwide registry with adequate long term follow up , quality of life information and relevant subgroup analysis to define new standards in the treatment of patients with aortic stenosis .
the purpose of this review is to summarize the features of the currently available bioprostheses in the light of competing procedures .
for the invasive treatment of symptomatic aortic stenosis several attractive options became available beyond conventional cardiosurgical implantation of stented bioprostheses or mechanical valves . besides stentless prostheses , in particular transcatheter procedures are of growing importance .  
thus , 9.704 bioprostheses were implanted in germany in 2010 , according to 84% of all implanted prostheses in aortic position .
overall , even in face of more innovative biological alternatives the implantation of stented bioprostheses is still a very interesting option and represents actually the most frequent valve implantation technique for aortic stenosis . especially in the light of growing use of interventional valve replacement
