popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm is one of the sequelae of popliteal artery trauma and also can cause arterial thrombosis , arteriovenous fistulae , or arterial severance.26 we report a case of a false aneurysm of the popliteal artery after a tka with unusual presentation , difficult diagnosis and successful management .
the clinical presentation of this condition can be confused with that of a postoperative dvt or hematoma formation in early postoperative period and the surgeon should be aware of this condition .
vascular complications after a total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) occur in less than 0.5% of cases.1 it is uncommon , with a reported incidence following tka ranging from 0.03 to 0.17%.27 however , when such a complication does occur , it is potentially limb and life threatening .
the treatment options include an open surgical repair or other described noninvasive techniques such as percutaneous embolization or endovascular stenting .
we hereby reported an exceptional case where there was trauma to the popliteal fossa due to a fall in the immediate postoperative period probably due to disorientation caused by the use of iv fentanyl and the location of arterial rent was on posterior aspect .
the rent was not on the anterior aspect , indicating that the injury to the artery was as a result of the impact on the popliteal region due to a fall in the immediate postoperative period and not an intraoperative incident as is seen in most of the reported cases of popliteal pseudoaneurysm following tka .
