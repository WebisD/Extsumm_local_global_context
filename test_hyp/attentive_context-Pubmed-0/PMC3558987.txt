, with typical minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic90 ) values of 00080015 mg / l , up to 3 log reductions in bacterial viable count over 24 hours and low potential for resistance development.24 murine studies indicate a long elimination half - life 57 hours and excellent efficacy in models of infection.5,6 pharmacokinetic studies in man indicate the potential for once or twice daily dosing.7 the objective of this study was to utilize an in vitro pharmacodynamic model simulating human pharmacokinetics to evaluate potential therapeutic regimens of afn-1252 against s. aureus , including both methicillin - susceptible s. aureus ( mssa ) and mrsa .
greater reductions in viable count were observed with q12h regimens than corresponding q24h regimens , against both mssa 29213 and mrsa s186 at 24 and 48 hours .
fabi is the sole form of enoyl - acp reductase present in s. aureus , s. epidermidis , and other staphylococci .
as a result of these studies , the pharmacodynamic profile of afn-1252 was adequately characterized with the fauc / mic well related to antibacterial killing , which is also in agreement with what others have shown.15 twice daily dosing achieved marginally greater reductions in bacterial viable counts than once daily dosing , approaching the clsi definition of bactericidal .
