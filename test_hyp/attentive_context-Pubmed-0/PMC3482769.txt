moxifloxacin hydrochloride , a broad spectrum antibacterial agent used in the treatment of ocular infections , was successfully formulated as in situ gel - forming eye drops using sodium alginate as a gelling agent in combination with hpmc as a viscosity enhancing agent . thus , the developed formulation is a viable alternative to conventional eye drops by virtue of its ability to enhance bioavailability through its longer precorneal residence time and ability to sustain drug release . also important
is the ease of administration afforded and decreased frequency of administration resulting in better patient acceptance .
the aim of the present investigation is to formulate an in situ gel using novel gum system . in situ
this was previously seeded with test organisms ( escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus ) . after allowing diffusion of the solutions for 2 hours
gel solution increases the residence time and also sustain the release mechanism of the drug .

zone of inhibition values of formulation f1 to f6 and pure drug at the concentration of 2 g / ml against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli ocular irritation study was performed using healthy albino rabbits after getting prior permission from the institutional animal ethics committee .
