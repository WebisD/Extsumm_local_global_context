the elective surgical treatment of tio is tumor resection , which normally leads to a complete regression of the osteomalacial syndrome .
tumor - induced osteomalacia ( tio ) is a rare paraneoplastic disease in which causative tumor ( generally of mesenchymal origin ) gives rise to an oncogenic osteomalacial syndrome , whose underlying pathogenetic mechanism is related to the tumor s production of a phosphaturic factor that reduces the renal reabsorption of phosphates and causes renal phosphate leak . the tumors are generally small , slowly growing and non - invasive .
the consequent rehabilitation treatment must consider the complexity of the clinical - functional picture of the patient , especially if a substitution megaprothesis surgery is needed .
the clinical picture is characterized by non - specific symptoms , such as hyposthenia , worsening myalgia and bone pain ( mainly affecting load - bearing areas ) , and gait alterations ( anserine gait ) . until a correct diagnosis has been made patients usually undergo symptomatic treatments without success .
those patients history is characterized by numerous pathological fractures , periprothesical fractures and prothesis mobilizations .
the functional pictures which result are often complex for the long diagnostic - therapeutic pathway and for the highly invasive surgery needed .
