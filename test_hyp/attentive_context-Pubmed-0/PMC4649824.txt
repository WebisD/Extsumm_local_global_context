we are presenting a case of kls , who had complete remission with valproate and also reviewing the cases reported from india .
kleine - levin syndrome ( kls ) is a rare disorder which mainly affects adolescent boys and characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia , and sometime along with hyperphagia , behavioral and cognitive disturbances , and hypersexuality .
several medications ( stimulants , lithium , valproate , antipsychotics , and antidepressants ) have been reported to provide variable benefit in different symptoms , with lithium being the most widely used drug .
valproate may be a good alternative to lithium in terms of efficacy as well as side - effect profile .
similar to our patient , anticonvulsants ( like valproate ) are the preferred treatment for kls patient , and may also offer benefits in case of comorbid epilepsy .
