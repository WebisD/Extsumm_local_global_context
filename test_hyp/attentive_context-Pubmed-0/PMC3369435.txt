we therefore examined the association between fcgr3b cnv and bd , in a cohort of iranian patients .
the odds ratio for low copy number ( < 2 cn ) was 0.6 ( 95% ci 0.30 , 1.21 , p = 0.16 ) and the odds ratio for high copy number ( > 2 cn ) was 0.75 ( 96% ci 0.33 , 1.73 , p = 0.50 ) .
therefore there was no evidence that either low or high fcgr3b was associated with bd , and in fact , both low cn and high cn were slightly decreased in bd patients relative to controls .
this is the first study to examine the relationship between fcgr3b cn variants and behet 's disease , and we report no evidence of an association in terms of either disease susceptibility or clinical manifestations in this cohort of patients from iran .
51% ( 89 of 175 ) were hla b5 positive and 51% ( 41 of 80 ) were hla b51 positive .
while we were unable to demonstrate an association between fcgr3b cn and bd in this study , there are undoubted links to polymorphism in this region with vasculitic conditions . in future
