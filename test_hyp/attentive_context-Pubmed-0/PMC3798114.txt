our minimal physical model of a self - replicating 
 granular material 
 shows how secondary nuclei from such growth can lead to runaway charging
. 
 these effects may be present in ice on earth , in terrestrial thunderstorms , and in astrophysical ices , in the solar nebula , and in thunderstorms on other planets , some of which , 
 for example , on venus , may involve self - replicating granular materials 
 other than water ice . it is conceivable that this dynamics is involved 
 in the formation of the martian geological structures called razorbacks . while ice is clearly 
 the most quotidian example of a friable self - replicating granular 
 material , one that breaks easily and continues to grow , other such 
 materials can be both sought in different astrophysical environments , 
 and also produced in technological contexts .
anatomy of our minimal model of charging of friable self - replicating 
 granular matter through secondary nucleation , incorporating the processes 
 of particle growth ( ri  ri + 1 ) , advection 
 ( with speed ui ) , collision , 
 charge transfer , and fission ( with probability s ) .
here we build a minimal model 
 ( figure 1 ) incorporating solely the collisional 
 dynamics of charge transfer plus nucleation , growth , and fission processes , 
 which we aim to have general relevance to self - replicating granular 
 media .
