first , however , i outline the extent of the high - cost off - patent drug problem , drawing special attention to the negative impact of high drug costs on public health outcomes and public spending , and i discuss some of the problem 's underlying causes .
since the daraprim saga began in september 2015 , the high prices of pharmaceuticals in general , and of off - patent drugs in particular , have become political issues and topics of everyday conversation in the united states .
, turing pharmaceuticals acquired the marketing rights to daraprim ( pyrimethamine ) , a drug used to treat parasitic infections like malaria and toxoplasmosis . within one month
the media and the public have been quick to condemn turing and its leadership for what they see as rampant corporate greed , but they have been slower to accept that the public interests and private incentives that exist in tension in the turing story are both legitimate . the american economy is set up to reward players who best exploit market opportunities , and in some sense turing simply fulfilled its obligations to its shareholders by raising the price of undervalued daraprim .
