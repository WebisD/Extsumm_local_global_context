given the importance of diagnosing and quantifying molar rotation , this study investigated the average rotation of the u1 m in patients with class i , ii and iii , showing patterns of facial profiles i ( dental class i and dental class ii ) , ii ( skeletal class ii ) and iii ( skeletal class iii ) .
it was concluded that the dental class ii group had the highest mean mesio - palatal rotation of the u1 m ( 78.6 ) and more frequency , followed by the skeletal class ii group ( 74.95 ) , skeletal class iii group ( 73.83 ) , and the class i group ( 71.9 ) .
we included 100 patients divided into 5 groups of 20 patients in each : ( 1 ) group class i , facial pattern i ; ( 2 ) group class ii , facial pattern i that was dental class ii , ( 3 ) group class ii , facial pattern ii that is skeletal class ii ; ( 4 ) group class iii , facial pattern iii ; and ( 5 ) a treated group class i , facial pattern i. the cases were selected consecutively until they reached 20 individuals for each group , according to the cedp file order for the years 20002005 respecting the following inclusion criteria : presence of the four first molars ; 1 upper molar in occlusion and in good condition ( cusps without excessive wear and without prosthetic reconstruction ) ; and absence of posterior cross bite .
