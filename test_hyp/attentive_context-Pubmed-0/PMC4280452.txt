we report the case of a patient with pc and a single brain metastasis that achieved long - term recurrence - free survival following treatment with combined modality therapy .
a 71-year - old male presented with aphasia and muscle weakness of the left side of his body .
pleomorphic carcinoma ( pc ) is a rare malignant lung tumor characterized by dual - cell components including spindle or giant cells as well as epithelial cells .
pc has been reported to have a more aggressive clinical course and a poorer survival compared to other histological types of non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc )   .
the mib-1 index may therefore be a useful biomarker of the response to chemotherapy , with the reduction in the index following preoperative chemotherapy representing a response marker that reflects the proliferation of tumor cells .
pc is rare , accounting for 0.31.0% of all lung cancers ; it is defined as a poorly differentiated nsclc . in a recent large study on patients with stage
the changes in the mib-1 index caused by preoperative chemotherapy may therefore provide useful information for deciding the regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy .
based on these clinical findings , the patient was diagnosed with lung cancer with a single brain metastasis .
