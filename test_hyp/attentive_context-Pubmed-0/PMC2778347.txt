the present study was carried out in order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of phadiatop infant , an in vitro test designed to detect allergen - specific ige antibodies known to be relevant in the development of ige - sensitisation in early childhood .
an early correct diagnosis will thus allow for better management and a possibility to delay or even prevent the onset of asthma in children with eczema and the avoidance of further deterioration of lung function in children with asthma   .
the sensitivity calculated for the whole group of children was 98% ( 95% ci : 92100% ) and the specificity 89% ( 95% ci : 7497% ) .  
eighty - three of the children ( 68% ) reported at least one first degree relative , with about the same proportion for the atopic as for the nonatopic children , 71% and 61% , respectively ( data not shown ) .
thus , the test could be recommended as a complement to the clinical information in the differential diagnosis on ige - mediated disease in young children with allergy - like symptoms .
the ppv and npv values were 95% ( 95% ci : 8999% ) and 94% ( 95% ci : 8099% ) , respectively .
