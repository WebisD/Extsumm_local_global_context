is the high grafting density 
 and colloidal stability conclusively demonstrated , with important 
 implications for correct comparison of previous and future results 
 on np ligand density .
we conclude that direct ligand replacement of oleic acid - coated 
 monodisperse iron oxide nps can be optimized to consistently yield 
 grafting densities of 1 nda - peg(5 kda)/nm regardless 
 of core size in the investigated superparamagnetic range ( diameter 
 310 nm ) .
the 
 methods described in this work form the fundament for development 
 of a whole set of diversely functionalized nps that are suitable for 
 biomedical applications such as targeted mri , multifunctional superparamagnetic 
 nps , and drug delivery .
several mutually contradicting conditions 
 during the ligand replacement reaction have to be fulfilled : ( 1 ) to 
 dissolve the capping agent ( oleic acid ) , ( 2 ) to solubilize the dispersant , 
 ( 3 ) to keep the dispersant at low coil size , quantitatively described 
 by e.g. rg , which determines the grafting 
 footprint , and ( 4 ) to provide the right conditions ( protonation ) of 
 the anchor group to irreversibly bind to the core .
shell nps colloidally stable over many 
 months in biologically relevant media as well as withstanding demanding 
 tests such as temperature cycling in serum .
