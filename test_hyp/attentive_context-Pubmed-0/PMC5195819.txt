in the current study , we have identified the brain region with altered cortical thickness in patients with alcohol dependence .
post hoc correlation analysis between cortical thicknesses in the left superior frontal cluster of significant group difference and duration of alcohol use in alcohol dependence group demonstrated the significant association ( r=-0.55 ; p=0.02 ) ( fig .
cortical thicknesses in the left superior frontal cluster was also correlated with the clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scores ( r=-0.548 , p=0.028 ) .
the region of cortical thickness deficits in patients with alcohol dependence encompassed primarily the superior frontal cortex , after adjusting for the effects on the global cortical atrophy induced by alcohol dependence ( fig .
patients with alcohol dependence had general cortical thinning ( left hemispheric average cortical thickness ( mm ) : 2.440.07 [ healthy comparison subjects ] vs 2.240.27 [ patients with alcohol dependence ] , t=3.35 , p=0.002 ) ( right hemispheric average cortical thickness ( mm ) : 2.450.07 [ healthy comparison subjects ] vs 2.250.23 [ patients with alcohol dependence ] , t=3.77 , p<0.001 ) . in order to identify regionally specific cortical deficits in patients with alcohol dependence compared to healthy comparison subjects , hemispheric average cortical thickness was added as a covariate in the whole brain vertex - wise analysis . in the glm model that includes age and average cortical thickness as covariates , significant cortical thickness deficits in patients with alcohol dependence , compared to healthy comparison subjects , were noted in the left superior frontal cortex , after correcting for multiple comparisons with the permutation method ( fig .
