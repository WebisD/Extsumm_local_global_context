the purpose of this communication is to discuss this connection , and to do so we will ( 1 ) clarify the distinction between different types of systems of fractional differential equations , in particular discussing the difference between commensurable and non - commensurable ones , ( 2 ) show solutions for the corresponding response functions , and ( 3 ) discuss their application to the modeling of pk data .
recent papers by   and   show the application of fractional calculus to pharmacokinetics ( pk ) .
however , as pointed out by , while the connection between response function and compartmental structure is immediate for the single compartment case , this is less so for the case of multi - compartmental ones .
the paper of   shows solutions for some specific two- and three - compartmental structures described by fractional order kinetics .
, one can establish a direct analogy between the familiar sum of exponentials used in pk , and importantly all the relationships between compartmental transfer rate constants and the intercepts and exponents of the corresponding response functions found in classic textbooks on pk   , carry forward to fractional differential equations . in conclusion , while insight into the physiological interpretability of fde system might be gained in the future , and the formulation of non - commensurate systems of fde to represent the states of a system ( required by , e.g. , a physiological flow model ) requires further investigation , the response functions ( 8) and ( 10 ) can be used to investigate the existence of pk data sets which might actually show complex fractional kinetics.4
