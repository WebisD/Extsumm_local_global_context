the discovery and analysis of ncrnas has become an important step in the understanding of the genomics behind human disease .
the use of high - throughput sequencing to uncover and characterize ncrnas has both the biological relevance of traditional laboratory approaches and the genome - wide scale of the computational approaches .
high - throughput sequencing has opened the door on more research into the use of ncrnas either as tools for investigating protist biology , markers for disease detection or progression , or as potential avenues for treatment . although there is a long way to go to catch up with ncrna analysis from host species ( e.g. , human and mouse ) , the genomic sequencing of many pathogenic protists is already permitting genome - wide screens of ncrnas such as mirnas and sirnas .
studies of protist mirnas to date are showing that rnai has an important role in antigenic variation and hence the parasite s survival in its host . learning more about these systems
it is clear that genome biology of host and pathogens can no longer exclude the analysis of non - coding sequences .
other areas of active research are now looking at the integration of regulatory rna ( mirna and sirna ) data with protein gene expression sequencing data ( i.e. , rna - seq , or mrnaseq ) , to characterize how mirnas control their targets , and are themselves controlled , in different environments . in effect , this is a combination of mirna expression and target expression , all coming from the same sample .
