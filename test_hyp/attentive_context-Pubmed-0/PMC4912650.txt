magnetic properties and hysteresis loop of the mnps were studied by vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .
while fe particles were seen in malignant tumor cells , there was no trace of them in other organs .
the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) to investigate the size distribution and morphology of the nanostructure .
different amounts of necrosis were seen in the tumor tissues of all groups , but no significant difference in the necrosis extent was observed among the groups .
fourier transform infrared ( ft - ir ) was also applied to characterize the structure and purity of the compound .
the major findings reported here illustrate that fnp ferrofluid coated with dextrin is a good candidate for in vivo approaches without any side effects on body organs .
figure 7 shows stained slides of tumors in four groups . in order to document the presence of fnps between the cells and to investigate their effects on the surrounding medium , perl s iron staining was done.12,13 as shown in figure 7c , iron particles were present in malignant cells .
recently , the use of magnetic nanoparticles ( mnps ) in medical applications ( e.g. magnetic fluid hyperthermia ( mfh ) , magnetic drug delivery , magneto - mechanical actuation of cell surface receptors , magnetic gene transfection , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) contrast improvement ) has had an upward trend .
