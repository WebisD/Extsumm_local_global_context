, this study is the first comparing sagittal cervical parameters between the cervical spine lateral view and whole - spine lateral view . in conclusion ,
the purpose of this study is to determine if the radiographic parameters for sagittal cervical alignment are comparable between these two views .
however , the error of measurement , especially interobserver measurements for the cobb angles in the whole - spine lateral radiographs ( 4.08    7.78 degrees ) and distances ( 6.09    9.48 mm ) , were greater than the angular statistical differences ( 2.51    7.86 degrees of c2c7 angle ) and linear statistical differences ( 4.38    10.04  mm of c2 central off distance ) between the two types of radiographs ( table 1 ) .
our results suggest that to determine the alignment of only the cervical spine , there is no advantage to using whole - spine lateral radiographs .
the 95% confidence limits for intra- and interobserver variability of the cobb method in the cervical lateral radiographs were 5 and 9 degrees with the traditional manual method.16 in many cases , a 5-degree variation between the measurements in the whole - spine lateral radiographs by the traditional manual cobb method is acceptable.17 in the current study , the mean difference of the intra- and interobserver measurements for the cobb angles in the cervical spine lateral radiographs with digital methods was 0.58 and 0.73 degrees .
