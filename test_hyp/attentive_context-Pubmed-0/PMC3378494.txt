we used a mean - field version of a biophysical cortical attractor network model to derive predictions of the temporal dynamics of activity in a cortical region that selects between inputs reflecting the value of two options .
we first used a whole - brain statistical parametric mapping analysis to look for areas showing a main effect of performing the task relative to a pre - stimulus ( 300ms to 100ms ) or post - response ( + 100ms to + 300ms ) baseline .
we also investigated whether the main effects of task performance in this region was affected by factors shown behaviorally to modulate reaction time independently of value .
the present model performs the critical computation of transforming value - related inputs into a choice , and does so in a way that has captured single - unit activity during perceptual decision tasks .
can be elicited , and parametric modulation of input to these models may explain variation in gamma - band frequencies seen during working memory tasks in frontal cortex . alternatively , by varying internal parameters of a biophysical model , novel predictions might be derived of the effects of cross - subject variation on cortical responses measurable with m / eeg ( see also supplementary discussion ) . because these parameters relate to specific biophysical properties such as the density of network connectivity or the concentration of a specific neurotransmitter , it may be possible to directly relate these parameters to cross - subject variation in these properties , for instance via local measurements of neurotransmitter concentrations , or perhaps genetic polymorphism or pharmacological challenge .
