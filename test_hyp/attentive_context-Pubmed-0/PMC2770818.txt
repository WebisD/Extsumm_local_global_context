this is the first clinical case of isolated , externally induced hypertrophy of a muscle in which h - mrs was performed to quantitatively assess muscular lipid content . in musculature with fibre orientation nearly along the body axis ( and along the applied outer magnetic field ) even separate determination of metabolically highly active imcl and less active emcl is possible ( 5 , 6 , 10 ) . in conclusion , h - mrs could be helpful in the assessment of muscle metabolism in cases with partial denervation or nerve irritations .
total muscle lipid values of the patient 's sol muscles ( 19.3 and 18.2 ) were within the range of the control group .
for the patient 's hypertrophic right leg the tml - ratio amounted to 2.1 ( versus 1.13  0.16 in the control group ) ( fig .
those spectra show a difference in imcl between the right and the left leg of the patient : imcl content of the right sol - the same side as the hypertrophy of gm - is clearly lower compared to the left sol ( 9.2 versus 14.7 ) . in the control group
follow - up studies with h - mrs could become a tool for monitoring the success of therapeutic interventions .
