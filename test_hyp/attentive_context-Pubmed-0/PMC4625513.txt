based on these findings , we hypothesized that the tenascin - r expression in the superior , medial , lateral , and descending vestibular nuclei varied following unilateral vestibular lesion and subsequent compensation .
the results may also assist in developing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of symptoms of vestibular lesion . 

our results demonstrated for the first time that unilateral labyrinthectomy and subsequent compensation is accompanied by the modification of tenascin - r staining pattern in the vestibular nuclei of the rat .
unilateral labyrinthectomy results in elimination of sensory inputs from the vestibular receptors and the subsequent deafferentation - induced plasticity contributes to the restoration of vestibular function .
the reduction of the immunostaining of tenascin - r also suggests the extracellular facilitation of plastic modifications of the vestibular circuit after lesion .
the modification of tenascin - r expression showed regional differences in the vestibular nuclear complex which may be associated with the morphological and functional heterogeneity of the individual vestibular nuclei and with their different roles in the compensatory processes .
therefore , it appears reasonable that the temporary decrease in the tenascin - r expression presented in our study plays a role in the recovery from the vestibular disorder . in the lack of data on the role of tenascin - r in the vestibular system , we can merely state , at present , that the tenascin - r expression is changing after unilateral labyrinthectomy and during the subsequent compensation .
