iron phosphide nanowires have been synthesized through a nonaqueous approach that utilizes fe(acac)3 as an iron source , top as a phosphorus source and oleylamine as solvent .
, we developed a approach that uses a metal precursor of iron ( iii ) acetylacetonate ( fe(acac)3),which is low toxicity , inexpensive and rather stable at ambient condition . the structure and magnetic properties of as - synthesized nanowires are also presented in this work .
the as - prepared nanowires have a hexagonal fe2p structure and grow along c axis .
we present a primary result on the synthesis of iron phosphide nanowires using a solution - phase chemical approach . instead of using toxic and unstable iron carbonyl compounds that were usually employed in most of previous work on the synthesis of iron phosphide nanowires
the dimension of nanowires can be tuned via reaction parameters such as injection rate , reaction temperature , and top / topo ratio . both injection method and
the magnetic tests reveal ferromagnetic characteristics below the blocking temperature , and a large coercive force of ~5,000 oe has been observed .
the reported synthetic approach does not use commonly used toxic iron carbonyl compounds as iron precursor , which provides a convenient access to further studies of their special physical and chemical properties .
