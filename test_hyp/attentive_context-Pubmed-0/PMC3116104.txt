lower education level , older age , and a lower monthly income were predicting factors for a lower knowledge of stroke / ha symptoms and cvd risk factors .
a previous study reported that a 4 month educational intervention program for elderly adults with a mean age of 75 years was effective in improving awareness about stroke and ha symptoms.24 ) therefore , public health education for the elderly at risk of cvd should focus on improving awareness of having a stroke or ha to increase the knowledge of symptoms and risk factors of cvd , and to facilitate preventive actions .
the participants identified 7.3 of the 11 cvd risk factors : hypertension was the most frequently identified risk factor ( 78.4% ) , followed by stress ( 73.0% ) , whereas diabetes was the least frequently identified risk factor ( 47.1% ) .
lower education , older age , and lower monthly income were found to be independent predictors of the low knowledge of stroke and ha symptoms .
therefore it is important to identify the level of awareness about stroke and ha symptoms and risk factors in rural elderly people , in an effort to help them prevent and detect cvd .
