we present a case of hepatic sarcoidosis with a solitary giant nodule in the liver , but with radiological findings typical of hilar cholangiocarcinoma .
a surgical treatment including liver resection should be seriously considered , because a patient with hepatic sarcoidosis occasionally had to undergo liver transplantation in the end after a short period of observation without any treatment due to the difficulty of diagnosis like our case .
, we may occasionally encounter a patient with a solitary tumor in the liver for whom it is extremely difficult to make a differential diagnosis from the malignant neoplasm , much like our experience . in this case ,
a 51-year - old female was referred to our institution with abnormal laboratory data of liver function and the biliary system .
sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of non - caseating granuloma consisting of epithelioid cells .
the case reported here is important because of its morphologically distinct characteristics from radiological findings for hepatic sarcoidosis .
the diagnostic approach to hepatic sarcoidosis must be made on the histological evidence of non - caseating granulomas in a liver biopsy . in this report , we describe a rare experience with hepatic sarcoidosis , which we presented with clinical and radiological findings characteristic of hilar cholangiocarcinoma .
