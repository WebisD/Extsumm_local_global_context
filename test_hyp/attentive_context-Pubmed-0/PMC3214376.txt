the study groups had the same frequency of mi , thrombosis , stroke and tvr ( figure 1 ) .
kang and colleagues demonstrated that hypertension does not affect short and long - term cardiovascular complications of pci.18 patients in osvix group showed nonsignificant lower mace rate than the plavix group ( p < 0.05 ) .
the total study population represents a group of 442 patients ( mean age 59  9.5 years ) with stable angina pectoris in whom pci was performed . among them , 225 participants implanted bms and the rest implanted des .
patients were randomized at least 12 hours before planned pci to receive a 300 mg loading dose of plavix or osvix ( 1:1 ) and followed by 75 mg / day for 30 days in bms and 6 months in des groups .
tavazzi showed that concomitant disease and cvd risk factors can increase mace.17 whereas these risk factors were evenly distributed in the two groups in this randomized clinical trial ; a higher frequency of hypertension in the osvix group was seen ( p = 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
regarding changes in laboratory variable , no significant changes were found concerning liver enzymes , platelet and neutrophil counts between the two drug regimens in both des and bms groups ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
