the aims of this narrative paper are to explore the use of dbs in the treatment of movement disorders to review indications for its use and its mechanisms of action . the implantation technique for dbs and its possible adverse effects
movement disorders encompass acute and chronic diseases characterised by involuntary movements or loss of control or efficiency in voluntary movements . in movement disorders , dbs is a highly effective , safe , and reversible surgical treatment for advanced parkinson 's disease , tremor , and dystonia . its use has promoted interdisciplinary clinical team work and provided an improved understanding of the complex neurocircuitry associated with these disorders . for improvement of outcomes after dbs , a refinement of patient selection criteria is needed .
future technological advances clarifying pathophysiology of movement disorders and the need for improved research designs are discussed as well .
further evidence , particularly in the form of prospective studies and randomised controlled trials , is required to better establish the pathophysiology of movement disorders and its role therein .
dbs is a useful therapeutic option in carefully selected patients that significantly improves motor symptoms , functional status , and quality of life .
