the attachment and growth behavior of bone marrowderived osteoblasts cultured on smooth zirconia and surface coated zirconia showed comparable results .
this study was performed to characterize the attachment and growth behavior of bone marrow - derived osteoblasts cultured on zirconia surfaces with calcium phosphate coatings and hydroxyapatite coatings compared to smooth surfaced zirconia .
more in vitro and in vivo researches are necessary to identify a stable surface with controlled and standardized chemistry .
however , considering the dissolution behavior of the surface coatings of the zirconia , the ha coating was more stable compared to the cap coating .
research for new bioactive coatings for dental implants to improve tissue integration and stability are still in progress.16,17 the topography and the surface chemistry are of great importance.18,19 recently , surface - modified zirconia implants have been studied for long - term stability and strong bone tissue response.20 monoclinic zirconia coated on titanium has been proved to have positive osteoblastic behavior and is potentially useful in hard tissue replacements.21 calcium phosphate has been used as surface coatings on implants due to its bioactivity , which enables earlier stabilization of implants to the surrounding bone.22 coatings with high dissolution behavior have high concentration of ca which enhances osteoblast responses and improves bone formation around the implant.23 however , the dissolution behavior and the low adhesion strength of the coating layer have raised concerns on the stability of the implants.24 in the present study , the concentration of ca and p released from the coatings was higher with the cap group than the ha group . also , the ca and p concentrations increased with time on the cap group .
