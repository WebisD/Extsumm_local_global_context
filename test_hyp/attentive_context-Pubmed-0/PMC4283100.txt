although patients with converted procedures have higher rates of morbidity and compared with successfully completed laparoscopic procedures , morbidity and mortality of converted patients are still lower than those of planned open colorectal procedures .
the mortality rate in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection with and without conversion was 1.4% and 0.6% , respectively , while the adjusted risk of mortality in patients who underwent conversion was higher than in patients without conversion ( aor , 1.61 ; 95% ci , 1.451.78 ; p < .01 ) . also , the risk - adjusted mortality of patients who underwent planned open surgery was higher than for converted patients ( 3.9% vs. 1.4% ; aor , 1.70 ; 95% ci , 1.571.85 ; p < .01 ) .
factors such as history of previous abdominal surgery ( aor , 3.50 ; p < .01 ) and presence of metastatic cancer ( aor , 1.73 ; p < .01 ) have strong associations with conversion .
wound infection , postoperative ileus , and postoperative hemorrhagic complications in patients who underwent converted procedures are higher than for both open and successfully completed laparoscopic procedures . in colorectal resectional operations , crohn disease patients have the highest risk of conversion of any pathology . a history of previous abdominal surgery is the most important predictor of conversion in colorectal surgery . among procedures , proctectomy has the highest risk of conversion .
