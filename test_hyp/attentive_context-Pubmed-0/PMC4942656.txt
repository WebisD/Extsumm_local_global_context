the present work investigated the viability and efficiency of neonatal sciatic nerve end - to - end coaptation , performed with the application of fibrin sealant .
also , the present study demonstrates that neonatal end - to - end nerve coaptation is feasible and may in turn be of use for repairing obstetric brachial plexus injuries .
overall , the present data suggest that acute repair of neonatal peripheral nerve with both fibrin sealant analyzed , namely , a commercial brand and a nonhuman derived adhesive produced by cevap / brazil , promotes neuroprotection and regeneration of motor and sensory axons .
it is well known that neonatal axotomy results in devastating neuronal loss in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia ( drg ) .
the results shown herein indicate significant preservation of motoneurons in the spinal cord , assessed by direct counting at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks after lesion , reinforcing the long lasting positive effects of the repair procedure .
gfap and iba1 are highly expressed proteins in astrocytes and microglia , respectively , and are upregulated after lesion   . the fact that coaptation downregulates glial reaction at lumbar spinal cord level is in line with the positive anatomical and behavioral findings previously discussed .
