to our knowledge , limited data are available about genetic diversity of p. aeruginosa recovered from different clinical specimens in isfahan ; the purpose of the current study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles and genetic relatedness in p. aeruginosa isolated from patients admitted to a referral hospital in isfahan , iran .
genetic relatedness of clinical isolates of the detected p. aeruginosa has been carried out using rapd - pcr assay , which showed 55% to 100% similarity ( figure 3 ) .
; it is possible that different sources of p. aeruginosa be involved in our hospital that can lead to host colonization . in order to accurately control the infection , other p. aeruginosa isolated from hospital environment
prescription of common antibiotics ( imipenem and amikacin ) in our hospital due to high resistance rate must be restricted . according to our data , considerable genetic diversity exists among isolated p. aeruginosa
the highest percentage ( 55.6% ) of resistance was observed against ceftazidime and imipenem with 30 of the isolates being resistant ; all isolates were sensitive to polymyxin b ( figure 1 ) .
based on 65% similarity level , eight main cluster , with most of the strains belonging to cluster 1 were detected ( figure 3 ) .
