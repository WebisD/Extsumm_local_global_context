we report a rare case of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by streptococcus equisimilis , a ggs organism .
a 74-year - old woman became confused in her daily living , and the confusion was concomitant with a high - grade fever on april 29 , 2008 .
the lancefield group g beta - hemolytic streptococci ( ggs ) have been recognized as pathogens causing serious infections in humans , although ggs can have a commensal relationship when present on the skin , pharynx , intestinal tract , and vagina.1 the major pathological conditions predisposing ggs infections include malignancy , alcoholism , cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , bone and joint diseases , and cirrhosis of the liver .
we demonstrated a case of an endogenous ggs - related endophthalmitis where s. equisimilis was first identified from both anterior chamber and vitreous biopsies , and where identification was also first made by polymerase chain reaction .
, the efficacy of immediate ocular therapies including vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics against ggs - related endogenous endophthalmitis is still controversial.3 only further investigations will answer this question .
exogenous ggs endophthalmitis has been reported following cataract surgery , penetrating keratoplasty and trabeculectomy.2 on the other hand , endogenous ggs - related endopthalmitis is extremely rare.1 so far , there have been only 8 cases of endogenous ggs - related endophthalmitis;35 4 cases associated with endocarditis , 1 with cellulites of the foot , 1 with facial trauma , 1 with an abscessed tooth , and 1 of unknown origin .
