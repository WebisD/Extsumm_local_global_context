intensive treatment to a low hba1c target of less than 6% ( 42 mmol / mol ) can not be recommended for all patients with type 2 diabetes because primary cardiovascular outcomes , total mortality , and hypoglycemia were all adversely affected in high hgi participants in accord .
hgi subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of hypoglycemia was progressively higher in the low , moderate , and high hgi subgroups in the intensive ( 14.5 , 16.8 , and 18.8% , respectively ) and standard ( 3.7 , 4.5 , and 7.5% , respectively ) glycemia treatment groups ( table 2 and fig .
3c ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.02 ) in the intensive treatment group ( 7.7% ) compared with the standard treatment group ( 6.3% ) .
hgi subgroup analysis indicated , however , that intensive treatment actually improved primary outcomes in low and moderate hgi participants , a beneficial effect that was offset and masked by the apparently detrimental effects of intensive treatment in the high hgi subgroup .
mean (  95% ci ) hba1c (  ) and fpg levels (  ) for low , moderate , and high hgi subgroups after 1 year of standard ( a ) or intensive ( b ) glycemia treatment . for each panel , hba1c or fpg values with different superscripts ( a , b , c ) are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) .
