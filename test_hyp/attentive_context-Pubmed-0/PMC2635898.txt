thus , the aim of the present study was to determine the vertical distance between the maxillary central incisors and centre of the incisive papilla .
this study investigated the vertical distance between maxillary central incisors and centre of incisive papilla .
the dentist and laboratory technician can be use the results of this study as a guideline in fabrication of maxillary occlusal rims and in determination of the position of the occlusal plane with the reference of other anatomical landmarks together .
the kappa scores for the assessment of intra and inter observer agreement were higher than 0.75 which implies substantial agreement between the observers ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
the volunteers were examined by one of the investigators of the study and one hundred volunteers ( 58 women , 42 men ) were selected from the students that have the inclusion criteria with a draw .
however , the wax rim should be modified intraorally to incorporate individual characteristics , and the anterior tooth should be arranged on modified wax rim . also , further investigations are needed in different age , gender , race , dental and skeletal morphology groups .
the mean vertical distance between maxillary central incisors and midpoint of the incisive papilla on the stone casts was 6.700.81 mm .
