we report a case of early erosion of an embolization coil from the renal vasculature into the urinary collecting system causing urinary tract obstruction and urosepsis .
one of the important but rare causes of urinary tract obstruction is the migration of embolization coil into urinary collecting system .
hemorrhage after percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is a significant complication that occurs in a small percentage of cases .
a 23-year - old male underwent left urs and pcnl for a left upper ureteric calculus and a 2.5-cm lower pole renal calculus in a community hospital in december , 2010 .
pseudoaneurysm formation is the most common cause with a reported incidence of 0.6 - 1% .
however , arterial injuries sometimes require transarterial embolization to control the refractory bleeding . in patient presenting with refractory bleeding ,
all the three patients presented with hematuria and renal colic . in our case , patient presented early ( 3 months ) with complaints of renal colic and persistent fever after coil embolization . hypothetically three mechanisms of coil erosion have been proposed .
we found only three case reports in which embolization coil migrated to the collecting system.  in all these case reports the coil eroded after 1 year following embolization .
