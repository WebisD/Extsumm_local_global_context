immune cells and their ratio influence prognosis and that could be clinically applied in nsclc .
the nlr in patients with nsclc without metastases amounted to 2.32 ( 1.75 to 3.69 ) and was not significantly different from the nlr in patients with metastases 2.39 ( 2,01- 3.67 ) ( p=0.614 ; p = ns ) .
this is the retrospective analysis of nrl and prl in patients with nsclc at the time of the diagnosis of disease before any anti tumor treatment ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery ) .
objective of this study is to compare neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio ( nlr ) and platelet / lymphocyte ratio ( plr ) in patients with nsclc ( non- small- cell lung cancer ) with and without metastases at the time of diagnosis to find out if there is the importance of these cell ratios in the assessment of severity nsclc .
the plr in patients with nsclc without metastases amounted to 116.14 ( 81.99 to 170.99 ) and was not significantly different from the plr in patients with metastases 167.60 ( 124 , 60- 204.90 ) ( p = 0.068 ; p = ns ) .
more investigations will improve the understanding of the lung cancer and may develop novel therapeutic opportunities .
