metastatic lesions account for about 1% of all sellar and parasellar pituitary tumors and have to be borne in mind when evaluating patients .
, we aim to discuss one such scenario , where a patient presented with central diabetes insipidus ( di ) related to pituitary metastasis , even though there was no identifiable primary lung lesion at the time of presentation .
a 47-year - old female with a 20-pack year smoking history presented to an outside hospital after she overdosed on acetaminophen for relief of her headache .
our patient had an unusual situation where there was no discernible primary lesion in the lungs , and yet the biopsy histopathology was suggestive of lung - based adenocarcinoma .
however other systemic manifestations as well as signs and symptoms related to metastatic spread and paraneoplastic syndromes should be kept in mind . through this case presentation and review of the literature
clinicians should be aware of malignancies that are well known to metastasize to the posterior pituitary and consider breast and lung as potential sources .
the last decade has seen an increased availability of techniques to aid screening , early diagnosis and targeted treatment of all forms of lung cancer , despite which the incidence continues to rise .
