importantly , we show that the state ( at the moment ) anxiety was significantly associated sbp and dbp responses to both cold pressor and anger recall laboratory stress tests in this population .
this study investigated whether anxiety differentially affects cardiovascular reactivity to cold pressor and anger recall stress tests in a sample of young , healthy , community dwelling african american adults , a population prone to develop cardiovascular disease .
we report that state ( in the moment ) anxiety was significantly associated with blood pressure response to both stressors ( anger recall and cold pressor stress tests ) in this population .
a sample of 179 ( 116 males , 63 females ) participants of african descent were recruited to the study .
in contrast to blood pressure , state anxiety differentially predicted hr response to cp but not ar . on the other hand ,
cardiovascular reactivity was defined as the change in cardiovascular parameters ( sbp , dbp , mean arterial pressure ( map ) , and heart rate ( hr ) ) following the induction of a stress stimulus compared to baseline cardiovascular parameters .
these results support the idea that identification of hyperresponders to acute stress tests among african americans must take into account anxiety levels before determining whether an individual has increased reactivity to acute stress and/or that anxiety may play an important role along with reactivity response in hypertension development .
