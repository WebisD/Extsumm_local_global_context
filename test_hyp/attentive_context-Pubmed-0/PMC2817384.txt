the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between ghrh - induced gh secretion in obese premenopausal women and cardiovascular risk markers or insulin resistance .
we think that these data strongly suggest a role for insulin resistance in the decreased gh secretion of obesity , and the concept that the blunted gh secretion of central obesity could be the pituitary expression of the insulin resistance ( metabolic ) syndrome .
in conclusion , we have found that obese premenopausal women with decreased ghrh - induced gh secretion when compared with obese patients with gh sufficiency , have increased total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , liver enzymes , fasting insulin and homa - ir , when compared with obese patients with gh sufficiency . there was a significant negative correlation between peak gh secretion and total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , liver enzymes , fasting insulin or homa - ir . there was a significant positive correlation between igf - i and peak gh and a negative correlation between igf and homa - ir , but igf - i levels
data , in this study the increase in total and ldl cholesterol was no longer significant after controlling for measures of adiposity whether bmi , mid - waist circumference , or trunk fat
