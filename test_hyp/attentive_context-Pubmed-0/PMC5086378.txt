even though these factors may not be changed , the identification of their presence in individuals and families may enable health professionals to advise change in the lifestyle of these patients , avoiding early manifestation of t2 dm .
this systematic review was conducted to provide a comprehensive assessment of the association between the polymorphism in the gene tnfa -308g / a and the presence of t2 dm .
morocco significant associations between the tnfa -308g / a polymorphism and the risk of t2 dm were identified   : two of them in patients with other comorbidities such as coronary heart disease   and atherosclerosis . in the present study , therefore , we infer that although there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the association between polymorphisms in the tnfa -308g / a gene and increased risk for development of t2 dm , the presence of positive results may mean that few studies have not been enough to clarify this relationship , and besides there is no documented evidence in various ethnic groups .
this evidence supports the assumption that polymorphisms in the tnfa gene and its association with other aspects , both genetic and environmental , may represent an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus .
