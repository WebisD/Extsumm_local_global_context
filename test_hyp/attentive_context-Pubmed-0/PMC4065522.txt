a retrospective review of clinical records of late postpartum eclampsia patients who had presented with acute onset of visual and/or neurological symptoms to the emergency department of a medical college hospital in south india between april 2009 and may 2013 was done .
all patients had underwent mri with diffusion weighted imaging ( dwi ) and apparent diffusion coefficient ( adc ) mapping to differentiate vasogenic from cytotoxic cerebral edema .
we conclude that there is a higher prevalence of cortical visual loss in patients with pres associated with late postpartum eclampsia .
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( pres ) is a rare neurotoxic state that presents with altered mental status , headache , seizures , and visual disturbances along with neuroimaging features of vasogenic edema involving the posterior cerebral circulation .
bilateral visual loss was noted in five patients of whom three patients were able to perceive hand movements and two patients had only perception of light .
patients with higher degree of vasogenic edema of the posterior cerebral white matter might present with visual loss .
clinical and imaging findings are summarized in table 1 . clinical profile of patients with pres the 10 patients ranged in age from 21 to 32 years ( average-26  3.49 years ) .
