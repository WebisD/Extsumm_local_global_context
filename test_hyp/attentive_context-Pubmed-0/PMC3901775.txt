the primary objective of this retrospective study was to identify predictors of prolonged los in patients hospitalized for aecopd .
in conclusion , we found that admission between thursday and saturday , paco2 , serum albumin level , and comorbidities such as heart failure , diabetes , and stroke were associated with los .
the or for the presence of heart failure , diabetes , and stroke was 2.26 ( 95% ci 1.343.80 ) , 1.90 ( 95% ci 1.073.37 ) , and 1.83 ( 95% ci 1.043.21 ) , respectively . an increase of 1 kpa in paco2 had an or of 1.26 ( 95% ci 1.121.41 ) , and an increasing serum albumin level ( or 0.92 [ 95% ci 0.880.97 ] ) were associated with a shorter los .
the reported findings may help physicians to identify patients at risk of a long los in the early stages of an aecopd admission , and thus introduce the possibility of offering better follow - up .
