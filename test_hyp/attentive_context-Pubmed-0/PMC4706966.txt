additionally , the authors examine if resting eeg predicts brain cortical activity during exercise . in line with the neural efficiency hypothesis subjects with high maximal oxygen consumption
the present study investigates whether or not aerobic power has an effect on the alpha / beta ratio during exercise .
, the model was able to explain 15% of the variance compared to 18% and 26% for the use of central and parietal alpha / beta ratio , respectively .
the maintenance of pedaling movements is associated with increasing feedback from sensory afferents and feed - forward due to the recruitment of motor neurons   . although the magnitude of the changes in alpha / beta ratio from rest to exercise was similar between groups , high compared to low had a higher index in both conditions .
moreover the use of resting eeg rhythms as predictor for task performance is also applicable to cycling as resting state arousal predicted maximal power .
compared to the resting state , the alpha / beta ratio was decreased during cycling exercise as beta power increased more than alpha power .
the decrease of the alpha / beta ratio from rest to exercise was most pronounced at central brain region , where inter alia sensorimotor information of lower extremities is integrated . in this respect ,
