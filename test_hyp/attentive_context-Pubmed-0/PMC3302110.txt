ros is a precious property for the prevention of various diseases and aging . in this study
, it was shown that -glucan extracted from barley exerts significant antioxidant activity , in addition to the various biologic activities previously described .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to examine the antioxidant activity of -glucan to assess potential new health benefits associated with -glucan as a polymeric excipient for supplement and food additive .
the effects of the extraction source , extraction method , and molecular size of -glucan on antioxidant activity were also investigated .
these results indicate that -glucan has promise as a polymeric excipient for supplement and food additive with antioxidant and other benefits , which may contribute to enhancing health and beauty .
the amount of antioxidant activity of -glucan was influenced by the different physiologic properties ( e.g. , structure and molecular size ) of -glucan , which varied depending on the source and extraction method used .
furthermore , the antioxidant activity of -glucan was compared with that of polymers that are commonly used as food additives .
hydroxyl radicals have the strongest reactivity and oxidation power among ros . the ability to scavenge
