therefore the aim of our study was to address this gap in the evidence and to undertake a comparative thematic analysis of the ways in which parents accounted for their use of opioids , ost and benzodiazepines during and after pregnancy .
while this focus may relate to concerns regarding the effects of specific drugs per se on parenting capacity and the immediate safety of children , it could also result in a limited view of drug dependence that neglects to consider polydrug use and the impact of socio - economic and structural inequalities . while the use of opioids and ost is stigmatising , especially in the context of pregnancy and parenthood ( holland , forrester , williams , & copello , 2013 ) , use of benzodiazepines in the context of mothering has historically been characterised in a less problematic ( though not entirely positive ) manner ( metzl , 2003 ) .
although long - term benzodiazepine use and dependence among opioid - dependent populations has been a topic of concern for some decades ( who , 1996 ) and is associated with increased risks and harm ( lader , 2011 , 2014 ) , research regarding the impact on pregnancy , parenting and family life has been limited ( acmd , 2003 ) .
