therefore , the aim of this preliminary study was to assess the midterm clinical efficacy and safety profile of low - dose mr prednisone in gc - nave patients with axial spa refractory or intolerant to nsaids or with comorbidities limiting tnf- blocking agents .
in this retrospective trial , a 12-week oral treatment with low - dose mr prednisone significantly reduced disease activity , fatigue , stiffness , and pain in steroid - nave patients with spa .
efficacy was accompanied by a positive safety profile . taken together , these results suggest that low - dose mr prednisone , alone or in association with anti - tnf- agents , might be a valuable therapeutic option in patients with spa intolerant / refractory to nsaids . despite its limitations , the authors study may provide useful information and guidance for future studies to confirm the effective use of mr prednisone in this setting .
oral prednisone has been developed , and its use has been approved in rheumatoid arthritis in europe . administered at bedtime , its timing of drug release early in the morning ( at about 02.00 am ) better suits the circadian rhythms of inflammation and symptoms , with a clinically relevant reduction in pain and morning stiffness compared to conventional prednisone.15 the efficacy of low - dose mr prednisolone in patients with spa is unknown .
