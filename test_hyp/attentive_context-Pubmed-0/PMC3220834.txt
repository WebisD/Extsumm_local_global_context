risk for hyperglycemia was negatively and independently related with self - reported w - intake in normoglycemic middle - aged individuals from the french general population
it suggests that an increase in w - intake , an easy and costless intervention , could prevent or delay the onset of hyperglycemia and subsequent diabetes .
the negative association of w - intake and risk for hyperglycemia was relevant among many subsets of participants , and those reporting a low w - intake ( < 0.5 l ) had a higher risk for hyperglycemia ( for example , participants in the high physical activity group ) ( supplementary table 1 ) . this indicates that identification of individuals with a w - intake of < 0.5 l may be widely relevant to target preventive interventions regarding the metabolic risk .
ors ( 95% cis ) for the association between daily w - intake at baseline and the risk of incident hyperglycemia ( fasting plasma glucose 6.1 mmol / l or treatment for diabetes ) are presented according to two statistical models ; variables for adjustment were either known risk factors for type 2 diabetes or factors associated ( p < 0.10 ) with hyperglycemia and w - intake in our population .
