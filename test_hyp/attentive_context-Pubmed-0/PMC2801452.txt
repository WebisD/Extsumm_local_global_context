furthermore , we evaluated the association of a variety of potential tumor biomarkers with the observed response to ccrt .
several investigators have shown that fdg - pet / ct can more accurately predict the lack of residual disease both at the primary site and the neck ( negative predictive value 100% , sensitivity 100% and specificity 96% )   and it has therefore been considered to be a valuable clinical tool in the management of scchn .       
it is well known that assessment of response to chemo - radiotherapy in patients with scchn is not accurate , since a number of them are considered by radiologists as having partial response , because of residual abnormalities in posttreatment ct scans . during the last few years fdg pet / ct scans had been increasingly used for initial staging and assessment of tumor response in scchn .
mmp9-mediated release of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) and recruitment of pericytes to the angiogenic vasculature have been postulated to be the major processes involved in mmp9-stimulated angiogenesis .        in the present retrospective analysis
interestingly , one patient with a pr had a negative fdg - pet / ct after the completion of ccrt and was considered as having a cr .
