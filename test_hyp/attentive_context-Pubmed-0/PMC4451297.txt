celiac disease ( cd ) is an immune - based enteropathy triggered by dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins in barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals .
this is a complex disorder , with environmental and immune - genetic factors contributing to its etiology .
recently , the espghn ( european society of paediatric gastroenterology , hepatology and nutrition ) proposed that cd may be defined as an immune - mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten and related prolamins in genetically susceptible individuals and characterized by a variable combination of gluten - dependent manifestations , cd - specific antibodies , and hla - dq2 or hla - dq8 haplotypes , causing duodenal chronic inflammation .
thus , focusing the attention on this interaction and its breakdown may allow a better understanding of the cd pathogenesis and finally get novel translational avenues for preventing and treating this widespread disease .
thus other immune , genetic , and environmental factors must be involved in cd onset .
so , in genetically predisposed individuals , gluten in association with microbial antigens can stimulate and modulate innate and adaptive immune response , sustaining a chronic mucosal inflammation , underlining this chronic disease . in summary
