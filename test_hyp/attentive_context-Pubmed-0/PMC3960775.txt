the findings confirmed the significant nontoxic , antiarthritic , and anti - inflammatory pharmacological effect of saraca asoca 's acetone extract which is comparable to the standard drugs in a dose - dependant manner , possibly due to the presence of flavonoidic chemical compounds and the resultant lowering in the level of prostaglandin in the blood .
the scientific pharmacological evaluation of the analgesic , antipyretic , and acute anti - inflammatory activities of the acetone extract of seeds of saraca asoca has given significant and positive results during animal experimentation . therefore , its antiarthritic pharmacological action was evaluated on animals following the adjuvant test to find out its chronic anti - inflammatory effect which could validate the possible usage of these seeds as an effective nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory antiarthritic drug having the property of antioxidant , immune modulator , analgesic , and so forth .
500  mg / kg ) as compared to the standard group could be attributed to the presence of high concentrations of flavonoidic phenolic compounds in the extract which are known to exhibit antimicrobial , antiviral , antiulcerogenic , cytotoxic , antioxidant , antihepatotoxic , antipyretic , and anti - inflammatory activities .
