lbv likely co - evolved with its natural megachiropteran host until a genetic stasis had been reached in which the virus 
, the high seroprevalence to lbv in this population may pose a substantial public health risk because e. helvum is widely distributed in africa and a food source in west africa .
the underlying cause of the difference in seroprevalence between e. gambianus and e. helvum with respect to lbv infection is unclear .
although it is not the only protein to determine the pathogenicity of lbv , the r333 substitution still remains an important marker of rabies pathogenicity . in conclusion
more detailed analysis relating to age - specific infection and survival rates or mode of transmission was precluded by the difficulty in determining the age of adult bats , the lack of juveniles in the sample , and the cross - sectional sample used .
this situation would result in high seroprevalence rates after a wave of virus circulation in a colony .
previous studies have suggested that healthy bats develop antibodies to other lyssavirus infections ( 7,10,11 ) , which may reflect past exposure , rather than survival from clinical disease .
the number of high reciprocal titers against lbv ( figure 1 ) and the history of lbv isolation in e. helvum suggest that lbv circulates in megachiroptera in ghana . however , further work is needed to determine the specific phylogroup 2 virus and its prevalence within specific bat populations . no previous estimate of r0 for genotype 2 lyssavirus has been calculated , and although anamnesis may lead to no detectable antibodies in bats with immunity and a consequent underestimate of r0 , this value indicates the potential r0 and is comparable to values previously estimated for lyssavirus infections in bats ( 7,11 ) .
