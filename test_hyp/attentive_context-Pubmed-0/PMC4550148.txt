requires a multidisciplinary approach with input of entomologists , epidemiologists , educators , and infectious disease and communications specialists .
ticknet is a public health network that includes partners from state health departments and academic institutions collaborating through the emerging infections program ( eip ) , staff of state and local health departments collaborating through the epidemiology and laboratory capacity ( elc ) cooperative agreement , and cdc staff in the division of vector - borne diseases and the division of parasitic diseases and malaria .
built on the pillars of the eip and the elc cooperative agreements , ticknet provides a collaborative network that brings together these resources at the federal and state levels to enhance surveillance , improve prevention , and identify new tickborne diseases .
approximately 18 state and local health departments are funded annually for lyme disease surveillance , with priority given to states with a reported incidence of lyme disease greater than the national average and to bordering states where the disease may be spreading . during 2014 , an additional 7 state and local health departments received elc funding to support surveillance for other tickborne diseases . together with elc funding for program support , funding through eip has allowed ticknet partners in maryland , minnesota , and new york to undertake special studies to quantify underreported tickborne diseases .
