we retrospectively reviewed the prospectively collected data on 190 consecutive patients who underwent otg and latg , for gastric cancer between january 2009 and april 2010 at a single institution .
to first flatus ( p < 0.001 ) and commencement of soft diet ( p = 0.034 ) were checked earlier in the latg group than in otg group .
there were significant differences for the amount of estimated blood loss ( latg 179.7 ml vs. otg 272.7 ml ; p < 0.001 ) and postoperative change in hematocrit ( hct ) ( latg 36.2 vs. otg 34.5 ; p = 0.002 ) . the mean day
operation time , it took longer to perform for latg than otg ( latg vs. otg ; 150.8 minutes vs. 131.2 minutes ; p < 0.001 ) .
, the present study has suggested that latg is not only a feasible procedure for postoperative complications but also contributes to the improvement of early surgical outcomes including bowel movement , pain during recovery , and hospital discharge .
nrs scores were significantly lower in the latg group than in the otg group at pod 0 at 11:00 am , pod 1 at 8:00 am , pod 1 at 11:00 pm , pod 2 at 8:00 am , pod 3 at 8:00 am , pod 5 at 8:00 am ( p < 0.001 , p = 0.003 , p = 0.005 , p = 0.008 , p = 0.010 , p = 0.004 ) .
