, there was a gradient in probability of reimbursement , with the highest probability for drugs that were estimated to be cost - saving and the lowest probability for drugs that were estimated to increase annual costs between a$10 million and a$30 million . however , probability of recommendation was higher for those submissions with a financial impact of > a$30 million compared with those with a financial impact of a$10 to a$30 million .
the results of the analyses presented in this study indicate that the estimated financial impact of a drug on the australian drug budget is a predictor of the pbac reimbursement recommendation , even when controlling for the cost - effectiveness ratio and other confounding variables . in the descriptive analysis
the impact of multiple submissions on the probability of recommendation for reimbursement was significant with an odds ratio of 9.62 for a third and 3.66 for a second observed submission compared with the first observed submission .
categorical financial impact was the most important factor to make the first partition ( logworth = 7.18 ) by grouping the three financial impact categories , > a$0 to < a$10 million , a$10 million to a$30 million , and > a$30 million , into a single category and comparing it with a$0 .
