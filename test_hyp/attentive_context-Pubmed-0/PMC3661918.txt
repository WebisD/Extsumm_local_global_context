thus , it should be stated that two stages  pharmacophore  and  docking  investigations are necessary to estimate properly an affinity of newly designed receptor ligands . on the whole , these studies were intended to prove that postulated two - stages procedure can be applied to verification of the properties of even very similar structurally potential and being designed antipsychotics .
the quite recently reported x - ray structure of the human 2-adrenergic receptor opens new possibilities for modeling of the correct structures of the dopamine ones .
the first step includes determination of pharmacophores for two tested compounds of well - known affinity ( previously in vitro determined ) to the same receptors as well as pharmacophore pertinent to well - known d2 receptor agonists or antagonists and finally comparison of their properties to in vitro binding data .
.  1the chemical formulas of compound i and compound ii the chemical formulas of compound i and compound ii the pharmacophores of compounds i and ii were found on the basis of their structures determined by x - ray diffraction method .
thus , only docking of compounds i and ii to d2 receptor is detailed analyzed .
yellow dashed lines denote hydrogen bonds ( color figure online ) the obtained docking results are not unexpected since , purposely , the structurally similar compounds were investigated to point out that even very subtle differences in the chemical structure of compounds , to which docking procedure is  insensitive  , may impact crucially on their therapeutic activity .
