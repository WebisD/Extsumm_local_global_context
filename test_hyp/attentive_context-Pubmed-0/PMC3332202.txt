although there have been no randomized trials especially in patients with melanoma brain metastasis , treatment can be guided by the application of evidence for the treatment of brain metastasis in general . a promising new approach to deliver radiation therapy while sparing the hippocampus
the role of radiation therapy in the management is highly variable due to the natural history of the disease . to provide optimal management of the patient with melanoma

 metastatic melanoma in the brain is a serious event in patients with melanoma because of the poor prognosis and potential impact on quality of life .
these differences are a probable reflection of patient selection based on the number of cerebral metastasis , performance status , and extent of extracranial metastasis .
two large institutional series of 686 and 702 patients   indicate a generally poor outcome , with the majority ( up to 95% ) dying directly from brain metastases .
there were some differences in survival according to treatment received , being 8.9 months for surgery plus whole brain radiotherapy ( wbrt ) , 8.7 months for surgery alone , 3.4 months for wbrt alone , and 2.1 months for supportive care .
the radiation therapy oncology group recursive partitioning analysis ( rpa ) classes have been validated in melanoma .
