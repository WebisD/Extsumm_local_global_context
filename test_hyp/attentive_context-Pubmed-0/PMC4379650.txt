irrespective of method used for agitation , the percentage and depth of sealer penetration for mta fillapex was significantly greater ( p < 0.001 ) than ah plus .
ultrasonic activation of pseudoplastic sealers can significantly increase its percentage and depth of penetration and level of root canal can affect both , percentage , and depth of penetration of sealers in the dentinal tubules .
hence , this study was planned to evaluate percentage and the depth of dentinal tubule sealer penetration of mta fillapex when agitated with three different techniques and to compare it with ah plus using clsm as the evaluative tool .
the percentage and depth of sealer penetration of different groups and intergroup comparison are summarized in tables 1 and 2 , respectively . shows mean and standard deviation of depth and percentage of sealer penetration of various groups at 3 and 6 mm levels intergroup comparison of depth and percentage of sealer penetration at 6 and 3 mm levels mean percentage and depth of sealer penetration of mta fillapex and ah plus sealer was greatest when ultrasonics was used for agitation and statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) than lentulo spiral and counter - clockwise agitation techniques .
