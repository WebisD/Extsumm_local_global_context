this study had three key findings : ( 1 ) 3 pmn and 1 pc per hpf as a histologic criteria for the diagnosis of moderate to severe salpingitis , while performing better than the other criteria , appears to have limited utility even more so for cases of mild salpingitis ; ( 2 ) endometrial specimens were often unevaluable for histopathology , and unevaluable specimens were more likely in subjects with severe salpingitis and hiv - infection , and thus may affect the utility of endometrial histopathology to confirm the clinical diagnosis of pid in similar settings ; ( 3 ) the pmn response increased with disease severity for hiv-1 seronegative but not hiv-1 seropositive women with salpingitis . since kiviat et al .
cohort , n. gonorrhoeae and/or c. trachomatis was found in 49% of the patient population ; in comparison , the cohort in our study had a high hiv-1 prevalence and a combined gonorrhea and/or chlamydia prevalence of 18% ( table 1 ) .  
as demonstrated by higher clinical severity score ( css ) ( 15.5 versus 13 , p < .03 ) and severity of salpingitis based on laparoscopic findings ( p - trend <
