refrigeration at 4c presented a significant time- and material - dependent effect on the viscosity and polymerization kinetics of the two dental adhesive resins tested . under clinical conditions ,
the results of this study demonstrated that the refrigeration of the bonding resins dramatically increased their viscosity , and similar values to those of the non - refrigerated sample were detected only 20 min after removing the materials from refrigeration .
the bonding resins of two adhesive systems were evaluated : scotchbond dual - cure ( 3 m espe , st .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of refrigeration at 4c and post - refrigeration times ( immediate , 5 , 10 , 15 , or 20 min ) on the viscosity and conversion kinetics of bonding resins .
in contrast , for clearfil , all post - refrigeration times showed lower rp values compared with the control group . comparing the bonding resins ,
a continuous decrease in viscosity with increased post - refrigeration time was observed for both bonding resins . for scotchbond ,
for scotchbond , a significantly higher final dc value was detected for the control compared with the immediate and 5 min post - refrigeration groups ( p<.001 ) .
