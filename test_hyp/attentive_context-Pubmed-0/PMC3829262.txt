, we intended to evaluate association of crp as an inflammatory marker with acute cerebral ischemic attack characteristics , risk factors and to determine a cutoff point of hs - crp in predicting early mortality .
cut - off point of crp was 2.15 mg / dl and measuring hs - crp within the first hours after stroke increase the predicting rate of early mortality risk .
significantly increased rate of mortality by 13.3 times was seen in patients by simultaneous crp > 2.15 and nihss > 10 as cut - off points for predicting mortality , so that out of 23 patients possessing these conditions 11(47.8% ) died . in the patients who had simultaneously crp > 2.15 ,
comparing of multivariate factors with early death in the patients with stroke nihss : national institutes of health stroke scale ; rr : relative risk ; crp : c - reactive protein
roc curve of variables for predicting mortality in the patients with stroke association between hs - crp and early mortality in the patients with acute cva was significant .
our patients were classified to 3 sub - groups : nihss score < 7 ( mild neurologic disorders ) , nihss score 7 - 13 ( moderate neurological disorders ) and nihss score > 13 ( severe neurological disorders ) . according to toast classification criteria , large vessel atherosclerosis was seen in 95 subjects ( 58.6% ) , cardioembolic in 11 ( 6.8% ) and small vessel occlusion in 56 patients ( 35% ) .
