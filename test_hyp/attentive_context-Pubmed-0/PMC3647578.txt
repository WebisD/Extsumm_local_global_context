spontaneously diabetic torii ( sdt ) rat ( figure 1 ) has been established as a model of nonobese t2d with three major complications , including ocular complications   .
the use of experimental animal models is essential to resolve these problems , and results of basic research in animal models of diabetes may be useful to clarify the pathogenetic mechanism of human diabetes as well as the causes of complications and in the development of drugs for diabetes .
it is important to develop animal models that correspond to various pathological conditions of human diabetes , and it is urgently necessary to develop models of diabetic complications that can reflect human diabetes , because the number of patients with type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) is rapidly increasing and progression of complications significantly affects the prognosis of diabetic patients .
although there are many t2d model animals such as goto - kakizaki ( gk ) rats , zucker diabetic fatty ( zdf ) rats , and otsuka long - evans tokushima fatty ( oletf ) rats , and these animal models show diabetic complications , severe diabetic retinopathy has not been observed in the existing models . in these circumstances ,
