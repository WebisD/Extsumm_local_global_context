in conclusion , we demonstrated the usefulness of electrogenerated acetonitrile anion in the alkylation of n - boc 4-aminopyridines , both from the point of view of the high yields and of the cleanliness of the reaction ( no by - products ) .
the following alkylation , by means of t - buok and alkyl halides , led to nonsymmetrically dialkylated 4-aminopyridine , while symmetrically dialkylated products were obtained directly from 4-aminopyridine by reaction with an excess of t - buok and alkyl halide .
a selection of synthesized compounds was in vitro tested to evaluate antifungal activity against different strains of c. albicans , c. parapsilosis , and cryptococcus neoformans ; data are reported in table 4 . as can be evidenced the nonsymmetrical dialkylated 4aps 3ac and 3ae showed a moderate antifungal activity towards c. albicans and c. parapsilosis with mic50 values of 32  g / ml and showed an interesting activity against cryptococcus neoformans , with mic50 values of 0.4 and 4  g / ml , respectively .
many literature data evidenced that the pyridine group can efficaciously replace the heme - iron chelating azole moiety present in classical azole cyp51 inhibitors and , therefore , the alkylation of 4-aminopyridine ( 4ap ) represents an important goal in organic synthesis to develop novel classes of antifungal and antiparasitic drugs   . due to the wide presence of these products ,
