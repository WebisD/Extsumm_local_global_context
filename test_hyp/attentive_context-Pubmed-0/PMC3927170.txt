dermatoscopy may be useful for differential diagnosis of difficult cases , in particular in diffuse aa or in patients with total hair loss by the presence of cadaverized hairs ( black dots [ bds ] ) , exclamation mark hairs ( tapering hairs [ th ] ) , broken hairs ( bhs ) , yellow dots ( yds ) and clustered short vellus hairs ( svhs ) in the hair loss areas .
this study was carried out in 75 patients of aa visiting dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care center in north karnataka between november 2012 and july 2013 .
demonstrated that for diagnosis of aa , yds and svhs were the most sensitive markers .
dermatoscopy is a noninvasive technique allowing rapid and magnified in vivo observation of the skin with the visualization of morphologic features often imperceptible to the naked eye .
dermoscopic features in various patterns of aa 44 patients ( 58.67% ) had received some form of treatment at presentation , whereas 31 patients ( 41.33% ) had not taken any treatment .
the higher incidence of svh in our study was probably due to the various forms of treatment already received by 58.67% of patients before their first visit to our center .
