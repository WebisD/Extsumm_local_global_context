whether index60 or another measure is used , it appears that an approach based on prediction and natural history can aid in diagnosing individuals at an earlier stage of disease .
since the analyses pertain to autoantibody - positive individuals , we are not advocating the replacement of standard diagnostic criteria with a metabolic index .
type 1 ( dpt-1 ) and trialnet natural history study ( tnnhs ) participants , all autoantibody - positive relatives of t1d patients , showing that once a diabetes prevention trial risk score ( dptrs ) ( 5,6 ) of 9.00 is exceeded , the 2-year risk of t1d is very high ( 7 ) .
1 ) , an indicator of accuracy , was significantly higher for index60 than for the 2-h glucose in both dpt-1 ( 0.75 vs. 0.66 ; p < 0.001 ; n = 633 ) and the tnnhs ( 0.78 vs. 0.66 ; p < 0.001 ; n = 1,717 ) . to assess the accuracy of ind60 + as a diagnostic criterion for t1d , we compared the first ogtts that were ind60+only ( i.e. , ind60 + and 2hglu ) with the first ogtts that were 2hglu+only ( i.e. , ind60 and 2hglu+ ) .
