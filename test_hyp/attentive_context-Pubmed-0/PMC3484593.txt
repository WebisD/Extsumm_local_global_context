- only cpr is equivalent to cpr including ventilation ( standard cpr ) , we performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials , focusing on survival at hospital discharge .
chest compression - only cpr is simpler than standard cpr to teach ( during courses but even by dispatchers under real conditions ) , and likely a higher percentage of bystanders would accept to perform it while avoiding mouth - to - mouth contact : the demonstration that it is ( at least ) as effective as standard cpr can be crucial to improve survival rate in out - of - hospital cardiac arrest .   with the underlying hypothesis that out - of - hospital cardiac arrest bystander - initiated compression
previous findings from observational studies in humans   documented that spontaneously performed ( i.e. , not dispatcher instructed ) compression - only cpr was as effective as standard cpr . in the sos - kanto study , including witnessed cardiac arrests , compression - only cpr resulted in a higher proportion of patients with a favourable neurological outcome than standard cpr in patients with apnoea , shockable rhythm and resuscitation started within 4 minutes ; ventilations did not add benefits in any subgroup . on the contrary , two recent nationwide observational studies   conducted in japan concluded that standard cpr should be preferred in out - of - hospital cardiac arrests of noncardiac origin , both in adults and in children ; in this group , the two cpr techniques were similarly effective for arrests of cardiac origin . among the tree randomized controlled studies included in this meta - analysis , only one study   included paediatric patients < 8 years old , but results of this subgroup were not separately reported ; the study by rea et coworkers reported a tendency towards a worse efficacy of compression - only cpr than standard cpr in cardiac arrests of noncardiac origin , and a tendency towards a better efficacy in shockable rhythm and in rapid ( < 6 minutes ) response by the emergency medical system
