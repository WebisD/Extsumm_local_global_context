  examples of positive and successful transitions demonstrated universal features across settings and healthcare providers , including the involvement of the client and family in decision making and planning , comprehensive and concise client information , opportunity for questions and followup by client and family as well as health care providers , time for planning and availability of staff to execute the transfer , and interprofessional and interorganizational collaboration .
our findings demonstrated that exemplar transitions in care are laden with paradoxes , or the coexistence of apparent opposites , including flexible structures ; independence and teamwork ; and client and provider focus . to ensure safe and effective care transitions , nurses and other healthcare professionals need to accept the paradoxes as a normal part of their practice environment and they need to engage in relationship - rich networks which foster creativity and responsiveness .  
viewed through a complexity lens , we see how the social act of call and response can lead to improved client and family outcomes , and that flexibility with regulation and standards is often required in complex sociotechnical work to make the care more efficient and adaptive to changing circumstances .
we conclude that the development and introduction of new regulations holds the risk of constraining professionals ' responsiveness at the point of care , thereby threatening client safety outcomes . rather than focusing on new standards of practice
