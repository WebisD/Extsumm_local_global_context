the amended residuals markov scgm(1,1)c model combines the advantages of both the single - factor system cloud gray model and markov chain , using residual to amend the system gray cloud ; it can take full advantage of the information given by the historical data of coal mine accidents , and overcome the data random volatile effects on prediction precision .
the prediction gained by applying the amended residuals markov scgm(1,1)c model is closer to the actual value ; in other words , its error is smaller , and it can better reflect the relationship between the coal mine safety accident death and the number of data series , so the prediction is reliable .
the gray scgm(1,1)c model is applied to imitate the development tendency of the mine safety accident , and the amended model is to improve prediction accuracy while markov prediction is used to predict the fluctuation along the tendency , so as to further improve the prediction accuracy on random volatile accident data .
the main reason is that the model requires data sequence must be exponential distribution , and fitting will be poor when data sequence fluctuations are comparatively large . based on system cloud gray prediction model features in , combining the advantages of both gray prediction and markov theory , according to the coal mine accident deaths provided by the state administration of coal mine safety , referencing the literature   , an amended gray markov scgm(1,1)c model is proposed .
