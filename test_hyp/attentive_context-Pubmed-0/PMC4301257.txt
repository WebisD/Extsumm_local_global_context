because leptin , neuropeptide y and insulin are involved in the modulation of energy balance , we attempted to evaluate these parameters during ramadan and after ramadan in fasting pregnant women . 

the most important finding which was derived from this study was the lack of negative feedback between leptin and serum neuropeptide y concentrations in fasting pregnant women during ramadan . 


 thirty nine healthy fasting pregnant women voluntarily participated in this cross - sectional study with the following conditions : an age range of 17 to 42 years and a mean of 26.9 (  6.4 ) , gestational age of 7 to 35 weeks with a mean of 21.9 ( 7.5 ) and a bmi of 18.3 to 35.9 kg / m2 with a mean of 25 ( 4.2 ) at the beginning of the study . 
 


 the mean of leptin during the first , second and third trimesters and in the postnatal stage was higher in pregnant women compared to the non - pregnant because of the increase in food intake with the advancement of pregnancy ( 20 ) .
these data provide an insight into the important role of leptin and neuropeptide y in the long term regulation of energy balance in pregnant women , with chronic diurnal fasting . also , these results show that the level of factors considered in this study were higher in fasting pregnant women compared to non - fasting pregnant women .
