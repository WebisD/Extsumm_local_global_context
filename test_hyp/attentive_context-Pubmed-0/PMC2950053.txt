just as the amount of dialysis delivered to patients with end - stage chronic kidney disease is important in determining survival , it was reported that the dose of intermittent haemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy ( crrt ) was also important in determining survival in patients with acute kidney injury ( aki ) [ 8 - 10 ] , although this was not a universal finding . as patients with aki continue to have high mortality , and evidence
correction of volume overload may help explain the positive findings and improved clinical outcomes reported from some of the earlier trials of increased dose of renal support , compared to the more recent va / nih and renal studies , which had similar fluid balance targets .
- based clinical management is somewhat limited , two prospective multicentre trials were designed to investigate the effect of dose of renal replacement therapy on outcome in patients with aki .
aki frequently occurs in the setting of multiple organ failure , and mortality remains high , with patient outcome typically dependent upon the severity of the underlying condition and associated co - morbidities .
these studies suggest that , for standard thrice - weekly therapy , medium - term survival ( measured in months ) is dependent on achieving a minimum level of small solute removal , as defined by the national cooperative dialysis study .
