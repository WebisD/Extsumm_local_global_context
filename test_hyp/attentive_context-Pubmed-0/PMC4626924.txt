a 47-year - old lady presented to us for evaluation of persistent hydroureteronephrosis on imaging .
the presence of caseating necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is almost always associated with tuberculosis and rarely with nocardiosis ( where granuloma formation is rare ) ; however , the clinical features ( no solid organ abscesses , response to att ) are not consistent with the latter . if tuberculosis had been entertained as a differential diagnosis , appropriate microbiological work up could have been initiated and if proven positive , the patient would have benefited from a 4 to 6 week course of anti - tubercular therapy prior to treatment for ureteric stricture , if it failed to resolve with medical therapy .
is the activation of a single focus of tuberculosis even in the presence of multiple tubercular pathological foci and at the other end is disseminated tuberculosis where more than one tubercular foci become clinically apparent simultaneously . in the case
described above , the simultaneous clinical activation of two pathological foci and later on presentation of an intracranial lesion suggests this patient 's immune response lay somewhere midway along the spectrum .
3 months earlier , she had been treated at another center for a 3 month history of right colicky flank pain associated with malaise and fever , without any lower urinary tract symptoms .
