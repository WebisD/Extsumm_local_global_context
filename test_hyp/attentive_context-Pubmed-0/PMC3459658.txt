one promising new technique is computational fluid dynamics applied to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) images made by ct scanning ; this technique allows evaluation of flow and resistance of separate parts of the lung.6,7 in the present study , this novel imaging was used , in addition to more conventional outcome parameters , to visualize the effects of a single ipv treatment in copd patients .
five moderate to severe copd patients ( three females and two males ) with global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease stages 3 to 4 , who were hospitalized for an acute exacerbation , were included in this study .
the sequence was set as follows : forced oscillation technique ( fot ) in upright sitting and supine positions , conventional lung function measurements ( including spirometry and body plethysmography measurements ) , in- and expiratory muscle strength , diffusion capacity , arterial blood gases sampling , and finally a 3d low - dose ct scan was taken within 1 hour prior to the ipv treatment .
the resulting models allow a calculation of the change in airway volume and change in airway resistance .
despite its small sample size , this study demonstrated that local treatment effects could be visualized with 3d imaging of the airways .
