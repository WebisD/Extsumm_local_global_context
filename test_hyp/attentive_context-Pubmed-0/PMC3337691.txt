our study also indicates a perfect match 
 between proteins and phosphate in terms of structure and interaction 
 energy , which are superior to those between proteins and arsenate .
the possible existence of 
 arsenate dna and rna in the gfaj-1 cell has attracted considerable scientific debate 
 as to whether and how arsenate analogues of phosphate can exist . because of problems associated with chemical stability , current 
 experimental approaches encounter difficulties in fully assessing 
 the characteristics of arsenate dna and rna .
apparently , 
 evolution has optimized the inter - relationship between proteins and 
 dna / rna , which requires overall changes at the molecular and systems 
 biology levels when replacing phosphate by arsenate .
overall , the interaction 
 energy differences between phosphate and arsenate dna are about one 
 to two times the standard deviations , indicating that the differences 
 between the phosphate and arsenate cases are significant . the smaller 
 protein  nucleotide interaction energy for arsenate dna / rna 
 could be explained by the larger volume of the arsenate nucleotide , 
 which weakens electrostatic interactions .
instead , we test computationally 
 possible arsenate  phosphate replacement by examining key molecular 
 systems ; however , because of the large size of the molecules our theoretical 
 protocols are also limited . for the atp and adenosine triarsenate 
 ( atas ) hydrolysis
