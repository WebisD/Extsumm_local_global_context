mpe is extremely rare , with a recent series reporting only 64 cases from relevant sources in the english literature since 2000 .
this relationship could certainly explain the poor prognosis and severe clinical complications seen with mpe .
multiple myeloma ( mm ) is a common disease , accounting for 10% of hematologic malignancies .
we present a case of mpe associated with hyperferritinemia and severe multiorgan failure , a clinical course resembling catastrophic inflammatory conditions such as hlh that has not been described in mpe before .
a 40-year - old male was admitted to our institution for acute hypoxic respiratory failure for 3 days .
we believe mpe could represent or be part of an extreme manifestation of myeloma disease activity leading to a severe inflammatory cascade with subsequent multiorgan failure .
we describe a case in which mpe presented with extremely high ferritin levels , reflecting the potential value of ferritin as an mm marker .
we recommend investigating ferritin levels in patients with mpe to better determine its relationship with pathogenic inflammatory states such as hlh .
myelomatous pleural effusion ( mpe ) is a rare entity , occurring in only about 1% of mm pleural effusions   with < 100 having been reported .
