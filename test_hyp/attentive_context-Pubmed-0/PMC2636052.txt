partial congenital 
 aphakia is a rare condition in which the lens appears to be 
 partially divided by a deep furrow.1 in the case of congenital duplication of lens reported by 
 thakkar et al.2 two lenses were placed obliquely in a straight line 
 with a clear area in between .
a young boy , 16 years old , presented with complaints of poor 
 vision in the left eye since childhood .
2 ] revealed 
 a bilobed lens in the anterior segment of the eye with normal 
 posterior segment .
the mechanism for this anomaly is not known yet . whether 
 it is part of a phylentogenic spectra or represents development 
 from two embryonically separate lens remains a question .
, he had a vision of 20/200 in the 
 right eye ( re ) and 20/20 in the left eye ( le ) .
our case has a deep furrow in the center fig . 1 with 
 localized absence of zonules .
richardson3 reported 
 a case in which the two lenses were asymmetrical , one being 
 larger than the other .
duke 
 elder has tried to explain the occurrence of the two entities 
 based on separate embryonic developmental sequences.1 he 
 suggested that the metaplastic changes in the surface ectoderm 
 leads the lens plate to invaginate at two place and forms two 
 lens vesicles which results in double lens.1 this suggests that 
 the lens is divided before the lens starts developing .
