the primary objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine alone , without use of opioids , on sevoflurane requirement during general anesthesia with continuous monitoring of depth of anesthesia by entropy analysis .
fraction of inspired sevoflurane at different time interval ( pi - post - intubation , fi - fraction of inspired ) end tidal sevoflurane at different time intervals ( pi - post - intubation ) during anesthesia maintenance , group b showed a statistical significant decrease in heart rate , systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline at all time points as compared to the group a ( p < 0.05 ) .
pre - induction heart rate , systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar between two groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
a significant decrease of 13% to 33% of etsevo concentration was seen with group b from 5 min to 60 minutes post - intubation ( p < 0.05 ) during surgery [ figure 2 ] .
after arrival in the operating room , glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg / kg and ondansetron 0.15 mg / kg intravenous ( iv ) were given as pre - medication in both the groups .
