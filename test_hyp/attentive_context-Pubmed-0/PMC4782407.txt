although , the histology of ovarian adult - type granulosa cell tumors ( agcts ) is well - documented , it is rarely encountered in cytological specimens and the identification of tumor cells is very difficult . here
surgery is the primary treatment for these tumors , however , long - term follow - up with history , clinical examination , and tumor markers are crucial for gcts , as later relapse is a common behavior for these unique tumors .
the name  granulosa cell tumor  ( gct ) was proposed by von werdt in 1914 .
on enquiry , she gave a history of hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy 22 years ago for uterine leiomyoma .
we believe that sensitive cytologic evaluation , histopathologic correlation , taking clinical history , and a positive immunohistochemical reaction with inhibin could help us in practice .
the case of primary retroperitoneal gct is reported for its rarity after excluding previous ovarian origins and to describe its relevance to the histologic origin . due to their rarity , agcts present a diagnostic challenge for cytologic preparations .
to have primarily originated retroperitoneal gct is even rarer . in medical literature in english from 1938 till today , only 12 cases have been reported .
