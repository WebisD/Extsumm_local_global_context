an 80-year - old man was transferred to our institute because of an incidentally detected renal tumor .
spontaneous regression of metastatic lesions from an rcc is extremely rare , but can result following the rf ablation of the tumor .
the patient underwent a right partial nephrectomy due to a previously diagnosed rcc eight years prior .
spontaneous tumor regression has been reported to occur for some types of malignant tumors , although the incidence is rare .
the rf ablation might be recommended as a good alternative treatment when a cytoreductive nephrectomy is required in patients with metastatic lesions , but are in poor general physical condition . in conclusion ,
a literature search revealed that our case was found to be the second case report on the spontaneous regression of pulmonary metastases following an rf ablation of the recurrent rcc ( 7 ) .
recently , this treatment modality has been considered as a good alternative treatment option because of its minimally invasive nature and excellent clinical outcome .
was intravenously infused during the rf ablation . a post - ablation ct performed 10 months after the ablation showed a lack of tumor enhancement within the right renal tumor ( fig .
