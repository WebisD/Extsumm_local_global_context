five bacterial strains , isolated from soil , grew on a minimal mineral medium supplemented with npeo15 ( 0.0365  m and 0.365  m ) as the sole carbon source , being pseudomonas fluorescens and klebsiella pneumoniae the two most efficient npeo15 degrading strains .
two of them , pseudomonas fluorescens ( strain yas2 ) and klebsiella pneumoniae ( strain yas1 ) , showed high capacity for using npeo15 as sole carbon source .
the extent of npeo15 degradation after 2448  h incubations , evaluated by cod and bod5 assays , was , 8595% and 99.9% respectively .
the kinetic rate constant ( k ) and the half life time (  ) for the npeo15 biotransformation by p. fluorescence were estimated to be 0.0072  h and 96.3  h , respectively , and the process followed first - order kinetics .
the degradation process was followed by viscometry of the previously used culturing media and measurement of the chemical and biological oxygen demands . to our knowledge , this is the first report of the npeox degrading activity by klebsiella sp .
finally , a mixture culture of yas1/yas2 in 1% npeo15 medium , ph 8 , showed a synergistic effect on the bacterial growth , reaching maximal values ( 0.095  au ) at 9  h incubations and 27c , which represents a stimulatory average factor close to 5.7 with respect to the individual bacterial cultures at 1% npeo15 medium ( 0.014 and 0.02  au ) ; additionally , the lag phase was absent ( see figure 4 ) .
