we herein report a the case of a patient with primary combined smcc with an sqcc element and investigate the expression of specific proteins for molecular - targeted therapy .
primary malignant tumors of the hypopharynx are predominantly squamous cell carcinomas ( sqccs ) , as primary small - cell carcinoma ( smcc ) of the hypopharynx is rare .
combined primary smcc and sqcc of the hypopharynx , referred to as composite tumor of the hypopharynx , is even more rare , with only 3 cases previously reported ( 13 ) .
to the best of our knowledge , a molecular - targeted therapy for treating combined smcc of the hypopharynx and larynx has not yet been reported .
a 74-year - old man , with a ~50-year history of excessive alcohol consumption and smoking , presented with a 3-month history of throat pain and hoarseness .
our case is the first to report kit and pdgfr expression in combined smcc in the hypopharynx and larynx ; if similar results are obtained from larger series , these data may have management and prognostic implications through the possible use of targeted biological therapy in these tumors . at present ,
