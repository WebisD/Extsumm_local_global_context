a 67-year - old woman with unilateral multifocal keratitis and no previous ocular pathology was admitted to our hospital .
to report an unusual case of multifocal bacterial keratitis that despite success - ful treatment caused chronic ocular hypertension .
corneal scrapings and conjunctival samples were obtained for culture and the patient received intensive therapy with fortified vancomycin and tobramycin eye drops .
the cultures demonstrated two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis , one resistant to ciprofloxacin and both sensitive to vancomycin .
treatment was effective and gradually discontinued after total cessation of the inflammatory activity . during the follow - up period ,
the patient developed late and persistent ocular hypertension of unknown etiology , in absence of any detectable inflammation or complication , and received permanent antiglaucoma therapy .
patients with multifocal bacterial keratitis may need intraocular pressure monitoring , even after complete infection healing .
unfortunately , it was not possible for our laboratory to test the sensitivity of the ciprofloxacin - resistant strain to newer - generation quinolones , which could have had better activity against these gram - positive organisms . in conclusion , the present case demonstrates that in patients with multifocal keratitis , differential diagnosis between fungal and bacterial infection is critical for successful treatment . besides treatment , patient follow - up and intraocular pressure monitoring may be needed , even after complete infection healing and resolution of inflammatory signs .
