we report a case of spontaneous ureteral rupture that occurred during concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a woman who had uterine cervical cancer associated with mild hydroureter without obstruction of the urinary collecting system .
a 66  year - old woman with a diagnosis of uterine cervical cancer was referred to the gynecologic department of our hospital .
the early diagnosis of renal pelvic and ureteral rupture can prevent the development of severe complications , such as abscess . in women who have uterine cervical cancer with ureteral stenosis and normal renal function , the placement of a double - j stent before concurrent chemoradiotherapy may help to prevent rupture of the renal pelvis and ureter .
most cases of spontaneous rupture of the renal pelvis and ureter are associated with ureteral obstruction by calculi .
the mechanism by which uterine cervical cancer causes spontaneous rupture of the renal pelvis and ureter has been suggested to involve obstruction of the ureter by tumor or swollen lymph nodes .
pelvic examination showed a 5-cm cervical tumor with bilateral parametrial involvement , which had infiltrated to bilateral pelvic walls .
first , rupture of the renal pelvis and ureter can occur during concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the presence of uterine cervical cancer with ureteral stenosis .
