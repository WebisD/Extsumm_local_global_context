the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of thrombosis associated with right - sided ijv catheters , the extent of thrombosis , its clinical implications and to relate it with the pharmacological prophylaxis for dvt .
central venous catheters ( cvcs ) have an essential part to play in the management of a critically ill patient .
small thrombus in the right internal jugular vein medium - sized thrombus in the right internal jugular vein large - sized thrombus in the right internal jugular vein incidence of cvc - related thrombus in males and females of 33 patients found to be having thrombus , in 21 ( 63.64% ) it was detected on the third day after cvc insertion , whereas in 12 patients ( 36.36% ) it was detected on the sixth day .
the risk of thrombosis was not increased with the use of hypertonic solutions or with the presence of factors like diabetes mellitus , hypertension and history of smoking . there is no consensus regarding management of asymptomatic cvc - related thrombus , and more prospective randomized studies are required . till then , knowledge of the different risk factors for the thrombus , its prevention and effective treatment of cvc - related infection remains the mainstay to avoid cvc - related thrombosis and its dreaded complications .
