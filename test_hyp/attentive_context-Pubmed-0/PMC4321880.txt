intriguingly , we show that neurons in aged mice are still capable of supporting higher rates of fast axonal transport , suggesting the existence of signals that can reverse the age - related decline in axonal transport .
we previously described the use of nmnat2-venus mice to visualize axonal transport of fluorescently tagged nmnat2 ( milde et  al . , 2013a ) . here , we use live imaging of peripheral nerve and cns explants to study age - associated changes in the fast axonal transport of nmnat2 and mitochondria .
identifying the signaling pathways , both locally within the axon and within corresponding cell bodies that drive the increase in transport capacity , could highlight more targeted means to trigger these changes and to investigate their effects on axon survival during normal aging and in age - associated neurodegenerative disease .
, our results also suggest that old neurons in an old systemic environment still have the capacity to sustain higher rates of axonal transport and that appropriate signals can trigger this increase
this could be linked to the known sensitivity of mitochondrial trafficking to calcium influx ( wang and schwarz , 2009 ) and suggests that , for analysis of cns axonal transport in explanted tissue , nmnat2-venus mice could be a more robust model than mitos .
