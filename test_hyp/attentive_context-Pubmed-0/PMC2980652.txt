rather than simply signaling the general presence of termites or providing a diagnosis of the species of termite inhabiting the wood , we postulated that these pellets could be chemically characterized so as to determine the status of a colony as active ( alive ) or inactive ( dead ) . here , we report quantification of the hydrocarbons in pellets of i. minor aged for up to 1  year after they were produced .
we document the changes in proportions of selected hydrocarbons as an indication of the length of time since the pellets were excreted .
the anticipated increase in local treatments , we felt that there would be considerable interest by the industry , regulatory agencies , and consumers for a simple and accurate means to determine whether or not a targeted colony / infestation is still in a structure .
the motivation for our study was to devise a method for the evaluation of the success or failure of drywood termite treatments , including fumigation and local application methods .
future research includes : ( 1 ) validating these findings for additional species of drywood termites and geographic populations of the same species , ( 2 ) validating these findings at different times of the year , and ( 3 ) exploring seasonality in pellet production and hydrocarbon quality in pellets .
