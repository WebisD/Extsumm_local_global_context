the prevalence rates were also high in cases of infertility ( 76.2% ) and abortion ( 48.9% ) when compared to apparently healthy animals ( 22.9% ) and were significantly associated with cases of infertility ( p < 0.03 ) ( table 3 ) .
likewise the prevalence of akav antibodies was significantly ( p < 0.001 ) higher in crossbred animals ( 39.9% ) than in indigenous breed animals ( 8.9% ) and in females ( 33% ) than in males ( 14.3% ; p < 0.001 ) .
akav infection was recognized based on serological evidence in sheep , goats , and cattle in various ecological zones of the country . the present study aimed at investigating the current situation of akav infection in sudan as a part of an ongoing research project on viral causes of reproductive problems of cattle in the country .
absence of clinically recognized symptoms of akav infections with noticeable outbreaks of abortion and foetal malformations may lead to underestimation of the importance of the disease in the sudan .
the seroprevalence was significantly high among 2 - 3 years old ( 45.3 ; p < 0.001 ) and in the winter season ( 58.1% ; p < 0.001 ) .
