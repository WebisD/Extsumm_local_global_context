in addition , non - latina black / african american females were significantly older ( 0.15 years ) than non - latina white females at wave ii only , p < 0.01 .
mostly heterosexual individuals were significantly younger ( bisexual range : 0.33 to 0.43 years ; mostly heterosexual range : 0.25 to 0.30 years ) than completely heterosexual individuals at all waves , p < 0.02 to p < 0.0001 .
bisexual individuals showed a different pattern , with bisexual males showing greater one - year bmi gains over time compared to heterosexual males , but only among non - latino white participants .
findings from this study demonstrated that sexual orientation and gender differences in bmi are not limited to non - latino white youth and young adults . among males ,
