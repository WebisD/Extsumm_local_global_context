natriuretic peptides are a family of hormones , sharing similar chemical structure ( a characteristic 17-amino acid ring structure , stabilized by a cysteine bridge , which contains several invariant amino acids and variable c- and n - terminal tails ) and biological function , with relevant effects in cardiovascular physiology and pathology .
beneficial and deleterious effects of nesiritide in cardiovascular and renal systems the clinical role of natriuretic peptides either as biomarkers for diagnosis , prognosis or monitoring of therapy , or as therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular and renal disorders has gained acceptance over the last decade . despite specific basic studies and clinical trials necessary to better understand the possibilities of natriuretic peptides in therapeutic interventions , the use of these peptides to treat cardiovascular dysfunction seems to be most promising .
anp and bnp secretion from the ventricles increases associated to a number of ventricular dysfunctions , and the extent of anp and bnp release under these circumstances is in relation to the severity of the pathology , that has led to the use of both natriuretic peptides as diagnostic tests for heart failure   .
future clinical trials are necessary to address the concerns raised and provide a better understanding of the actions of nesiritide in the management of acute decompensated heart failure .
