based on the above - mentioned reasons , the present study was aimed to compare the antiemetic effects of metoclopramide and ondansetron in the treatment of post head trauma nausea and vomiting .
mean changes of nausea severity before and after intervention in the 2 groups frequency of nausea before and after treatment in both groups
the incidence of fatigue ( p = 0.44 ) , headache ( p=0.58 ) and dystonia ( p = 0.06 ) had no significant difference in the two groups but the incidence of drowsiness and anxiety in the metoclopramide group was significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) .
since these complications can have adverse effects on the treatment of patients with brain injury , it is suggested that it may be better to use ondansetron in these patients .
however , changes in the severity of nausea in both groups before and after the treatment revealed that nausea had been decreased significantly in both groups ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 2 ) .
administration of both ondansetron and metoclopramide significantly reduced the severity of nausea ( p < 0.001 ) . the average score of nausea severity before the injection of ondansetron and metoclopramide in the groups were 89.312.5 and 85.3  14.9 , respectively ( p = 0.11 ) .
