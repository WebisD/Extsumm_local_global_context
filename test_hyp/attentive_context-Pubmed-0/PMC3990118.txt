 acute intussusception is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen in infants .

 a six - month - old child presented with complaints of repeated episodes of vomiting that contained only ingested milk .
conservative measures , including hydrostatic reduction , are the methods of choice for initial management . though widely accepted , the expertise is still not widely available , especially in developing countries .
, this method should be undertaken as teamwork , and not considered the work of a single specialty , which is the best way of treating the patients according to the standards of today . 

management includes both surgical and non - surgical methods , with gradually increasing importance recently being accorded to the latter .
a repeat ultrasound should always be done after the procedure as the chances of recurrence is high , especially in the immediate post - procedure period .
general improvement in the clinical profile of the patient including relief from crying , stable vitals , increasing abdominal distension during the procedure ( which indicates filling of the small bowel ) , and the disappearance of the abdominal mass , should also be given due consideration when deciding to terminate the procedure .
