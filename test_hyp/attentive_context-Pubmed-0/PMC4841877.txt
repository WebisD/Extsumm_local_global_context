the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of abz and mbz on the activity of the gst , alp and proteases in the protoscoleces of hydatid cyst and to evaluate their inhibitory effects on enzyme activity .
both drugs have an inhibitory effect on the activity of gst , alp and protease enzymes .

  statistical analysis using t - test showed the significant difference between protein concentrations and specific activities of the enzymes in e / s products of protoscoleces treated with abz and mbz in comparison with control group ( p<0.05 ) .
the results of the two drugs indicated that abz is more effective on the enzymes activities ( gst and alp ) as compared with mbz .
the mean protein concentration in the control group was 6.06 g / ml . protein concentration of e / s products of protoscoleces treated and control groups 
 p<0.05 ; between control and treated groups 
 
 p>0.05 ; between treated groups 
  the results of gst , alp and protease activity are shown in table 2 .
the mean protein concentration in the control group was 6.06 g / ml . protein concentration of e / s products of protoscoleces treated and control groups 
 p<0.05 ; between control and treated groups 
 
 p>0.05 ; between treated groups
