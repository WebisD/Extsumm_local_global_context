acute pancreatitis is an extremely unusual complication following non - thermal biopsy of the ampulla without attempted cannulation .
biopsies from the ampulla of vater are usually essential to diagnose premalignant and malignant lesions in asymptomatic or symptomatic patients .
we present this case because of its rarity and the accompanying intense clinical manifestations without further severe consequences .
a 51-year - old man underwent two gastroscopies over the prior 2 years with the indication of intermittent dyspepsia . on the last endoscopy ,
the patient s medical history entails features of unknown importance for the pathogenesis of pancreatitis ( sickle - cell trait , previous use of anticoagulants , and repeat sampling ) , but these features may have contributed to the advent of pancreatitis ; therefore , this case may be worth reporting for future reference . finally , although pancreatitis after sampling of the ampulla is a rare complication , endoscopists should take it into consideration before the procedure and inform patients accordingly .
our patient s symptomatology was severe and not in parallel with the trivial laboratory and radiological pathology , and most importantly , with the excellent outcome .
one can assume that mild forms of pancreatitis may occur more often than is actually reported in the literature . in conclusion , we present a case of acute pancreatitis following biopsy of the ampulla .
