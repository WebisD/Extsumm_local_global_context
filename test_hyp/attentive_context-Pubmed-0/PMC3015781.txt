the aim of the current study was to compare various aspects of a recently reported laparoscopic flip - flap technique with the conventional open inguinal hernia repair in a short - term follow - up .
operative time for group a ranged from 40 minutes to 55 minutes ( mean , 47.5 ) , in group b , operative time ranged from 20 minutes to 35 minutes ( mean , 27.5 ) .
the medical records of these patients were reviewed , and patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of surgery done : group a comprised those who underwent the new laparoscopic technique , and group b comprised those who underwent conventional open repair .
five patients had bilateral hernias in group a versus 7 patients in group b ( all of them had bilateral repairs ) .
postoperative follow - up of 3 months revealed recurrence in 4 cases in group a ( 27% ) , and no recurrences were encountered in group b.
a , intraoperative complications included 1 case ( 7% ) of vas deferens injury during mobilization of the flaps , and in 3 other cases ( 20% ) the flaps were torn during suturing , which necessitated multiple sutures to close the defect .
