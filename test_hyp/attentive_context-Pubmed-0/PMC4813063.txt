we report the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings in a case of iva seen as hyperintense signal intensity in basal ganglia on t1- and t2-weighted images .
relevant medical history and laboratory investigations ( wide anion gap metabolic acidosis , raised glycine and carnitine conjugates of isovaleryl coa ) can help in making the correct diagnosis of iva in a case of bilateral t1w - hyperintense signal intensity lesions involving lentiform nuclei .
early diagnosis is the key to treatment in the form of restricted protein ( specifically leucine ) intake , high - calorie diet , and glycine and carnitine supplementation .
other methods of diagnosis based on isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase ( ivd ) enzyme activity in the body cells and identifying dna changes in the gene encoding ivd can confirm the disease .
isovaleric acidemia ( iva ) is an inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disease caused by a defect in the metabolism of amino acid leucine .
diagnosis is made by identifying elevated levels of isovaleric acid and its derivatives and their glycine and carnitine conjugates in plasma and urine of patients .
a breastfed 4-month - old female presented to our emergency room with decreased feeding , a generalized clonic seizure , lethargy , and acidotic breathing for 3 h. a product of third - degree consanguinity , she was born by term normal delivery with no significant perinatal event .
