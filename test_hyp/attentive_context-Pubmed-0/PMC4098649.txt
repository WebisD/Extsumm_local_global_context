in addition , studies examining prevention and treatment efforts focusing on early - onset cases of mdd and adolescent - onset cases of obesity are warranted , as these may be most likely to reduce risk for the later development of the other disorder .
mdd and obesity were significantly correlated if both occurred by early adolescence ( r=.20 , se=.08 , p<.05 ) , but the correlation was not significant when mdd and obesity first occurred in late adolescence ( r=.03 , se=.09 ) or in early adulthood ( r=.09 , se=.11 ) . as can be seen from table 2 , obesity that developed by early adolescence did not significantly predict the onset of mdd anytime during the follow - up period ( during late adolescence or early adulthood ) , though there was a trend for early adolescent obesity to predict the onset of mdd during the late adolescent period .
obesity that developed in late adolescence did predict the onset of mdd in early adulthood among females ( a gender - by - obesity interaction effect ; figure 1 ) . as can be seen in table 2 , mdd that developed by early adolescence predicted the onset of obesity in late adolescence among females ( a gender - by - mdd interaction effect ; figure 2 ) .
