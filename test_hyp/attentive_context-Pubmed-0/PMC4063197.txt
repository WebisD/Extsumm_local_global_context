we tested the hypothesis that the 3-d vr series , including the translucent display , provides additional information beyond that of the 2-d orthogonal mdct in the evaluation of abnormal spinal curvature in patients treated at a cancer center .
this included the assessment of the spinal curvature in 32 of 48 ( 66.7% ) patients , including dextroscoliosis ( n = 16 , 2683 , mean 50.6 ) , levoscoliosis ( n = 8 , 2572 , mean 35.3 ) , and kyphosis ( n = 8 ; 4289 , mean 58.9 ) .
helpful  in comparison to the corresponding 2-d orthogonal mdct in the assessment of abnormal spinal curvature in 38 of 48 patients , specifically in the evaluation of abnormal curvature in 32 patients , bony definition in 14 patients , and additional findings , including surgical instrumentation , in 17 patients .
it is , therefore , beneficial for spine surgeons and radiologists involved in the care of patients with abnormal spinal curvature to be aware of the benefits of the 3-d vr series and the translucent display .
twenty - four patients had a dextroscoliotic curvature measuring between 26 and 93 degrees ( mean , 45.5 ) , 9 patients had a levoscoliotic curvature measuring between 25 and 72 degrees ( mean , 35.2 degrees ) , and 15 patients had a kyphotic curvature of measuring between 27 and 89 degrees ( mean 48.1 degrees ) .
