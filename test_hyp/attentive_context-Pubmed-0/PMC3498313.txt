this is the first report in korea . here , we present case of myocarditis associated with eosinophilia caused by t. canis vlm .
a 41-year - old woman presented at our hospital complaining of chest discomfort and pain .
toxocara canis ( t. canis ) , a common dog roundworm , is one of the causative agents of visceral larva migrans ( vlm ) .
when a patient who has myocarditis with eosinophilia occurs , toxocara infection should be considered for possible cause .
myocarditis may occur in 10 - 15% of cases of vlm , and in those cases , myocarditis is accompanied by an increased level of circulating eosinophils . there have been approximately 10 cases of myocarditis associated with toxocara infection and only 2 cases were found in english publication since the year 2000 .
human toxocariasis is a helminthozoonosis due to the migration of toxocara species larvae through human organism .
the antibody test against parasitic infection demonstrated that toxocara immunoglobulin g ( igg ) was positive . taken together , we diagnosed that she had myocarditis caused by t. canis vlm .
the mechanism of its anthelmintic action is inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule - dependent glucose uptake inhibition . in this case , for the control of aggravated eosinophilia , we started administration of prednisolone . because she did n't have cardiac tamponade , cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema , prednisolone was administered at 1.0 mg / kg / day.8 ) and as soon as we confirmed toxocara igg positive , albendazole was added to the medication .
