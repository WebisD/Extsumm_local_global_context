we provide a conceptual review of how nurses and other health care professionals can examine health disparities in native americans through epigenetic modifications that likely result from aces ( see figure 1 ) , including historical trauma , the residual of which is assumed to be historical loss associated symptoms .
here we provide evidence to suggest that aces result in methylation differences in genes that regulate the stress response and that these changes may contribute to an increased vulnerability for developing psychiatric disorders , as depicted in figure 1 .
in addition to these experiences , the persistence of stress associated with discrimination and historical trauma converges to add immeasurably to these challenges .
reservation - based native americans disproportionately experience aces and health disparities , significantly impacting long - term physical and psychological health .
thus , this adaptive response likely results in overactivation of this stress - response system , and this excessive activity has substantial negative consequences on the health and well - being of native americans , individually and across generations . here
reservation - based native americans live in pervasively adverse social and physical environments that place them at increased risk of exposure to a myriad of stressors during childhood which impact their psychological and physical health over their lifetimes .
