corticosteroid administration to hellp patients improves platelet count and the serum levels of ldh , besides reducing hospital / icu stay and blood transfusion rate .
there was no significant difference between cort - treated and control patients in the incidence of cesarean deliveries ( odds ratio [ 95% ci ] : 1.25   ; p=0.11 ) , prevalence of infections ( 0.78   ; p=0.73 ; table 2 ) , birth weight ( mean difference : 0.09   ; p=0.38 ) , infant respiratory distress incidence ( odds ratio : 1.13   ; p=0.78 ) and maternal mortality ( odds ratio : 1.27   ; p=0.65 ) ( table 2 ) . among the included studies , infant mortality was 23% in cort - treated patients and 8.3% in controls   and 4% in cort - treated patients and 0% in controls .
the present study , therefore , carried out a systematic review of the relevant studies and performed a meta - analysis of all related parameters for the sake of evaluating the efficacy of cort therapy observed in studies with controlled designs .
the mean differences in the changes from baseline between cort treated and controls were 0.44   iu / ml ; p=0.007 for ldh ( figure 4 ) and 143.34   iu / l ; p=0.04 for alt . however , the decrease in ast levels was not statistically significant in cort - treated patients in comparison with controls ( 48.50   iu / l ; p=0.15 ; table 2 ) .
