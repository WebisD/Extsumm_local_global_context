the authors report their long term experience on the assessment of serial intralipotherapy with phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate in two patients affected by madelung 's disease .
two male patients suffering from madelung 's disease underwent serial intralipotherapy with phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate ( lipostabil -nattermann pharma , cologne , germany ) .
pre- and 6 months post - treatment dimensions were assessed by measuring three diameters in each lesion with a 7.5 mhz probe ultrasound ( us ) scan performed by the same operator .
madelung 's disease is characterised by multiple disfiguring abnormal fat masses in the head , the neck , and the radix of upper limbs ; in 90% of cases it 's associated with alcohol abuse .
the phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate compound needs wide investigation for new treatment uses and long - term studies and hence that the recommended dose and safe application technique can be standardised .
the objectively demonstrated efficacy and safety of the treatment at the employed dosage together with its easy execution confirm the role of lipostabil as a non - invasive palliative reasonable therapeutic opportunity in madelung 's disease and an alternative to surgery in the more awkward locations of the disease .
