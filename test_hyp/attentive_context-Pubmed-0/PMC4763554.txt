pct in the present patient was associated with three predominant risk factors : hfe c282y homozygosity , hepatic iron overload , and exposure to an exogenous estrogen via a contraceptive vaginal ring .
chelation therapy with intravenous deferoxamine , subcutaneous deferoxamine , and oral deferasirox has also been used to remove excessive iron in patients with pct and should be considered in patients with pct who are intolerant of phlebotomy ( 18 ) . the rate of clinical and biochemical remission in the present patient was representative of that in other pct cases ( 1 ) .
in august , 4 months before presentation , a 35-year - old white woman of scots and english descent developed reddish urine for several days followed by eruption of vesicles and blisters on the dorsal surfaces of her hands and fingers , the sides of her nose , and her upper anterior chest , knees , and legs .
she had no menses in the 12 months before presentation due to the effects of a contraceptive vaginal ring ( nuvaring ; etonogestrel / ethinyl estradiol ) .
thus , the present patient had three common risk factors for pct in white women of european descent : hfe c282y homozygosity , hepatic iron overload , and use of an exogenous estrogen .
