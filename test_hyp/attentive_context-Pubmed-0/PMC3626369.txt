the percentage of patients who achieved the target glycemic value ( hba1c  7% ) was significantly higher among males than females after 4 months ( 41% versus 28% ;  = 6.21 ; p = 0.01 ) , as well as after 12 months ( 38% versus 27% ;  = 4.66 ; p = 0.03 ; figure 1b ) .
longer disease duration and higher basal hba1c levels were significantly negative predictors of target metabolic response in men , while in women negative achievement of the 1-year glycemic target was associated with baseline treatment with sulphonylureas or a combination oral therapy , with baseline therapy with metformin being related to a positive outcome at 1 year ( or : 0.321 [ 95% ci : 0.1480.696 ] ) ( table 2 ) .
target weight loss , arbitrarily expressed as 1-year percent loss  75th percentile in the whole population ( 8.5% ) , was more often achieved among females at 8 months ( 28% versus 15% ;  = 8.04 ; p = 0.004 ) and 12 months ( 33% versus 17% ;  = 10.98 ; p = 0.0009 ) ( figure 1b ) . after substituting body weight with bmi ,
we have , therefore , utilized this database to investigate whether and possibly how the therapeutic response by exenatide in type 2 diabetes is different between genders .
