ultimately , we show that the propagation of the systemic inflammatory response by the liver occurs through an nf-b - dependent mechanism and that inhibition of this signaling pathway can , in part , mitigate these responses .
herein , we demonstrate that lung - derived mediators are definitively upregulated by liver tissues in both in vitro and in vivo models of mechanical ventilation - induced inflammation .
the results of the current study present a novel finding of an nf-b - dependent mechanism of proinflammatory cytokine amplification by liver endothelial cells secondary to mechanical ventilation .
, we demonstrate that inflammatory mediators generated by the lung in response to mechanical ventilation decompartmentalize to the systemic circulation in a murine model of ventilator - induced inflammation .
. the results of in vitro experiments illustrating this phenomenon are further confirmed in an in vivo model of ventilation induced inflammation whereby a significant increase in transcriptional activity in these mediators is observed in the liver .
further studies examining specific intracellular pathways responsible for mediator amplification demonstrate that activation of the inflammation relevant nf-b signaling pathway in liver endothelial cells is in part responsible for these observations .
subsequently , we show that the levels of these inflammatory mediators are significantly amplified upon exposure to liver endothelial cells thereby resulting in a maladaptive upregulation of the systemic inflammatory response
