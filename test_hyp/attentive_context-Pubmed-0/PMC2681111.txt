the only variables significantly associated with presence of antibody against cchfv were history of tick bite ( p = 0.002 ) or of tick removal from the animals ( p = 0.03 ) , employment in animal husbandry ( p = 0.01 ) or farming ( p = 0.02 ) , and age > 40 years ( p<0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
in june and september 2006 , persons living in 56 villages of the 14 districts of tokat and sivas provinces ( figure 1 ) who had a risk for cchfv infection other than occupational risk ( i.e. , healthcare , slaughterhouse work , and veterinary care ) were randomly selected for the study .
effective tick prevention aids such as tick repellents may help reduce the risk . on the other hand , the absence of cchfv seropositivity in 87.2% of the population after 4 cchfv outbreaks in turkey may suggest that this population remains at risk for infection in the future .
other studies conducted in rural parts of iran and senegal during epidemics showed that the cchfv seroprevalence was 13% , comparable to our findings ( 9,11 ) . in the present study , history of tick bite and history of tick removal from animals
