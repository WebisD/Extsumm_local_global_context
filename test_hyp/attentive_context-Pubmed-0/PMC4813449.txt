adenomatoid odontogenic tumor ( aot ) is a benign , slow - growing , and noninvasive odontogenic lesion associated with an impacted tooth .
we present a case of unusually large aggressive aot in the maxilla associated with impacted third molar .
the presence of so - called unique  duct - like structures  under microscope imparts the tumor a glandular , i.e. , adenomatoid appearance .
the tumor is also known as  two third 's tumor  because about 2/3 cases occur in maxilla , about 2/3 cases are diagnosed in young females during the second decade , 2/3 cases are associated with an impacted tooth and in 2/3 cases , impacted tooth is canine .
a 19-year - old male reported with a chief complaint of painless mass over the left side of face and upper left back tooth region since 6 months .
the intraosseous follicular type is associated with an impacted tooth as in our case , whereas the intraosseous extrafollicular type has no association with an impacted tooth and the peripheral variant is soft tissue component , attached to the gingival structures .
the case presented is rare in occurrence because of certain atypical features such as unusual large size , aggressive behavior , the involvement of maxillary third molar , third molar present below floor of orbit , significant bony expansion , and cortical perforation . under general anesthesia ,
