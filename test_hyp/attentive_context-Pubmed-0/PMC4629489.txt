correlations of rapid3 were significant with individual responses on the basdai or basfi for spinal pain (  = 0.75 , p < 0.001 ) , spinal stiffness (  = 0.74 , p < 0.001 ) , fatigue (  = 0.68 , p < 0.001 ) , and physical function (  = 0.66 , p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) . correlations of rapid3 with physical measures of spinal mobility , or with acute - phase reactants esr and crp , were not statistically significant ( table 2 ) .
spearman correlations of rapid3 with as disease - specific composite and individual measures including basdai , asdas , and basfi correlation plots comparing scores for rapid3 versus ( a ) basdai , ( b ) asdas - esr , and ( c ) asdas - crp with rapid3 , and ( d ) scores for basdai versus asdas - esr .
demographic and clinical characteristics of study patients rapid3 scores were correlated significantly with basdai (  = 0.82 , p < 0.001 ) , basfi (  = 0.66 , p < 0.001 ) , and asdas (  = 0.76 , p < 0.001 ) ( table 2 , fig . ) .
