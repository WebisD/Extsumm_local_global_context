table 3 shows the m / f ratios of fish results for the study population of cll patients in categories of abnormal results ( either as a single abnormality or as a single abnormality plus multiple abnormalities ) , normal results and total results ( normal and abnormal ) with respect to gender .
our study addressed not only what the m / f ratio is in cll patients having the clinical phenotype , but also the m / f ratio in patients who have a genotype which included specific fish abnormalities .
since our laboratory has collected clinical and laboratory data over many years on major categories of cancers including cll , review and analyses of these data presented an opportunity to examine certain aspects of this question . in order to better study the nature of the multifactorial components in cll , we determined the representation of genetic abnormalities detected by four defined fish probes , with respect to male and female cll patients . by this approach ,
this explanation is that chemokines and chemokine receptors may play a role in b - cell malignancies ,   and that related cytokine - receptor genes map to the par of sex chromosomes .
