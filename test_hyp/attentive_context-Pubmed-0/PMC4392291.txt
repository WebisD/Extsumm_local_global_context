in such situations , the clinician must also balance the risk of further immunosuppression and chemotherapeutic toxicities with the risk of delaying appropriate leukemia therapy .
acute appendicitis and typhlitis are the most common causes of gastrointestinal surgical complications in children undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia with reported incidences of 0.54.4% and 1.76.7% respectively  
overall , managing concurrent malignancy and critical illness is a delicate balance , one in which decitabine may play a pivotal role ; however further clinical trials are needed .
a retrospective case review of all children 18 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia at our institution between january 2002 and december 2011 was performed after obtaining institutional irb approval . amongst 154 children eligible , three ( 1.9% ) patients
. early diagnosis by radiologic imaging is essential as appendicitis usually requires emergent surgical management .
given the favorable toxicity profile and efficacy in childhood aml , we suggest that decitabine may serve as a bridging anti - leukemic agent during serious illness and reduce risk of recurrence secondary to prolonged treatment delays .
our calculated incidence rate of appendicitis in the setting of acute leukemia ( 1.9% ) correlates with the reported incidence of 0.54.4% .
