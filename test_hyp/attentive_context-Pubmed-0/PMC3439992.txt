bronchial wall remodeling , a fundamental factor in the development of asthma , results from erroneous patterns of differentiation of bronchial cells , in particular fibroblasts   .
these data are in line with the in vitro observations of similar interrelations in human lung   and skin fibroblast , and lung smooth muscle cell populations   and with the in vivo data on reduced bleomycin - induced pulmonary fibrosis upon -catenin silencing in the murine model .
notably , our study was focused on -sma expression as a marker of fmt ; however , wnt signaling controls the expression of a number of genes in lung cells , including fibronectin and collagen .
this effect correlated with deficient nuclear localization of -catenin and p - smad2 in tgf-1/licl - stimulated hbfs .
fmt , a crucial event during bronchial wall remodeling and development of fibrotic changes observed in asthma , is supposed to depend on a concerted action of inflammatory mechanisms and inherent features of airway wall fibroblasts facilitating their phenotypic transitions in response to il-4   and tgf-   .
the observed augmentation of tgf-1-induced fmt by lithium in na hbf populations , along with a lack of differences in tgf- receptor expression levels between na and as hbfs , indicates the involvement of synergistic tgf-/gsk-3 signaling interplay in phenotypic shifts during differentiation of bronchial fibroblasts .
