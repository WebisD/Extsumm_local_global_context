the fdc of aspirin and clopidogrel has increased therapeutic compliance , which is a major factor in the poor outcome of stenting patients for acute coronary syndrome , by simplification of the medical regimen.7 in addition , overall costs can be lowered by decreasing the number of prescriptions , bottles , labels , etc.8 clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract , with a maximum concentration ( cmax ) of 2 ng / ml at 1.4 hours following administration of clopidogrel 75 mg , and is eliminated with a half - life ( t1/2 ) of 1.7 hours.9 in contrast , enteric - coated formulations of aspirin 100 mg show continuous absorption from the intestine with a time - to - reach cmax approximately 4 hours , and then the drug is rapidly eliminated with a t1/2 less than 1 hour . based on these pharmacokinetic properties of the two drugs , there should be little possibility of interaction in the absorption profiles , and their short t1/2 indicates that they are suitable for fdc because both drugs are almost completely eliminated within 12 hours after dosing . in this study , we compared the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel , aspirin , and its active metabolite , salicylic acid , in healthy men after administration of an fdc formulation and coadministration of clopidogrel and aspirin .
