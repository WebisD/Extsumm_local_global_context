significant differences in pressure were also detected 
 on the forefoot , midfoot , and the medial area of the hindfoot ( p < 0.05 ) .
ultimately , gait is possible through 
 interactions that link the human calcaneus , the sole of the foot , and the tips of the toes , 
 and this is why we have conducted this study , to determine the difference between flat feet 
 and the normal feet at different gait velocities using emg and foot pressure analysis .

 m : midfoot ; h1 : medial heel ; h2 : lateral heel the general characteristics of the subjects are shown in table 1 . muscle activities ( excepting that of the rectus femoris ) 
 of the flat - footed subjects were significantly different from those of the normal - footed 
 subjects at all of the different gait velocities ( p < 0.05 ) , especially those of the 
 vastus medialis and abductor hallucis muscles ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .
