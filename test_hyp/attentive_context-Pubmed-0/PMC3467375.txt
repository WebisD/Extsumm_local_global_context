, the author presents a case of a rcc located in the retrosellar and prepontine area .
rathke 's cleft cysts ( rccs ) are non - neoplastic congenital lesions that develop from an epithelial remnant of rathke 's pouch , a normal component of pituitary development that gives rise to the anterior lobe , pars intermedia , and pars tuberalis of the gland .
the unique mr findings of an intracystic nodule with low signal intensity on t2-weighted image may be an indicator in differentiating rccs from other parasellar cystic lesions .
the author reports a rare case of a completely retrosellar type of rcc that was not attached to the pituitary fossa .
topographically , rccs usually occur in the sellar fossa with or without suprasellar involvement , but they can arise from every part of the craniopharyngeal duct , which is a part of rathke 's pouch11,14 ) . intracranial ectopic rccs are exclusively found in the suprasellar region , likely a result of pouch remnants within the pars tuberalis above the diaphragma sellae3 ) . in rare instances , rccs may reside in the sphenoid sinus or clivus regions8 ) . in this report
a 41-year - old woman presented with an acute - onset headache , which progressively worsened over the following 3 days .
