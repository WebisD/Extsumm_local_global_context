overall , our results 
 provide insight into the nature of peptide confinement and hydration 
 in a rm environment and the importance of considering shape fluctuations 
 in characterizing the rm ensemble .
this study explores the effects of capped versus zwitterionic 
 n- 
 and c - termini on the helix stability of these same peptides in rms 
 using two force fields .
we have studied the effects of capped versus 
 zwitterionic termini 
 on the secondary structure of aka2 peptides encapsulated 
 in spherically restrained and unrestrained rms .
the ir spectra of the amide 
 i bond of the peptides were computed and directly compared with experiment . the computed peptide amide i ir spectra and water 
 rotational anisotropy decay were found to be largely insensitive to 
 the treatment of the peptide termini , while showing a distinct dependence 
 on shape fluctuations in the rm environment .
, measurement of these experimental 
 observables provides one way to critically assess the structure of 
 rms , in both the absence and presence of solvated peptide .
the observed rotational 
 anisotropy decay shows distinct differences in water dynamics induced 
 by the presence of the aka2
we found that the cap employed on the peptide termini did not significantly 
 alter the interactions between the peptides and their environment .
