given the fact that lumbar pedicle screws achieve a much better purchase than cervical lateral mass screws , there is a potential risk for screw pullout during the reduction technique .
the posteroanterior procedure for neglected traumatic bilateral dislocation of the subaxial cervical spine is a good method of achieving sagittal alignment .
bartels and donk reported the surgical treatment of three cases.1 they treated the first two cases through a three - stage approach ( anterior - posterior - anterior ) . because these cases failed and a fourth stage had to be added to correct misalignment , the third case was done through a posterior - anterior - posterior approach . as in our case , the authors stated that facet joints were covered with fibrous tissue and the joint space was not seen . based on their experience , they suggest that in cases of nonacute bilateral cervical facet dislocations , the operating sequence should be posterior - anterior - posterior . it should be noted that the cohort 's mean age was 71 , suggesting again that patients who present subacutely tend to be older . for this reason , an open single - stage posterior approach under neurophysiologic monitoring dramatically reduces operating time , which is important to reduce morbidity in these cases .
