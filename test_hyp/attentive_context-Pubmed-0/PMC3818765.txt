thus , the present 
 study clarified the characteristics of the standing performance posture for the trumpet and 
 the marching euphonium and investigated the effect of the performance postures of these 
 instruments on the lower limb musculoskeletal system .
in addition , it is possible that the trunk and lower 
 limb musculoskeletal system is affected differently by the technique used to hold the 
 instrument with the left hand during trumpet and the marching euphonium performance . because 
 the angles and muscle activities of the upper arm were not measured in the present study , we 
 plan to perform these measurements in a future study to elucidate the influence of different 
 instrument holding techniques on the trunk and lower limb musculoskeletal systems .
the muscle activity of the cervical 
 paraspinal muscles , upper fibers of the trapezius , and lumbar paraspinal muscles increased 
 significantly in the marching euphonium performance posture compared with the resting 
 standing position , as well as in the marching euphonium performance posture compared with 
 the trumpet performance posture ( table 2 ) . 

c : 
 significant difference between the trumpet performance posture and the marching 
 euphonium performance posture ( p<0.01 ) the anterior tilt angle of the trunk decreased significantly in the trumpet and marching 
 euphonium performance postures compared with the resting standing position , as well as in 
 the marching euphonium performance posture compared with the trumpet performance posture 
 ( table 1 ) .
