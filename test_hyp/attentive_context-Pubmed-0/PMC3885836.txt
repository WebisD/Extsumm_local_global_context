the rats were randomly divided into three 
 groups , the immobilization group ( n=10 ) , exercise group ( n=10 ) , and control group ( n=6 ) .
, rom limitation caused damage in the myogenic component , and after two weeks , 
 the arthrogenic component constituted more than 80% of the total restriction in rom20 .
, we observed the presence of granulation tissue - like 
 organization and infiltration in the joint cavity after two weeks of knee immobilization in 
 rats .
we observed slight intra - articular 
 hemorrhage , which indicates that the exercises used in this study might cause laceration of 
 granulation tissue and adhesion . in this study , it was clarified that rom ex maintains range 
 of motion and reduces the changes in the joint components .
the purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of the rom 
 exercise on joint components according to histopathological analysis .
therefore , it is necessary to examine several kinds of 
 frequency and the exercise strength in a future study . a number of studies have performed 
 remobilization following a joint immobilization period , and some have subjected animals to 
 exercise during an immobilization period .
