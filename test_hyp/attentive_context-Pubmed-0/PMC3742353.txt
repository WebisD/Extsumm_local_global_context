39 percent and 27 percent of the patients had s1 stage disease after 4 weeks of group o and e and there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to healing rate of s1 stage . to evaluate the effect of rebamipide plus ppi in large - sized or normal - sized ulcers
in conclusion , to the best of our knowledge , the present report is the first retrospective study to demonstrate that the safety and efficacy profiles of esomeprazole plus rebamipide and omeprazole plus rebamipide are similar for the treatment of esd - induced ulcers . especially in large - sized ulcers , esomeprazole plus rebamipide promotes ulcer healing .
thus , ppi plus rebamipide combination therapy was generally effective for a 4-week esd - induced ulcer healing rate , but in larger esd - induced ulcers there were some issues that need to be addressed . therefore , in the current study we assessed the efficacy of esomeprazole plus rebamipide combination therapy for esd - induced ulcer healing compared with omeprazole plus rebamipide combination therapy .
by contrast , there were no significant healing rate differences between large - sized ulcer and normal - sized ulcer for the s1 stage in group e. in large - sized ulcers , a significantly higher healing rate of s1 stage were observed in the group e compared to group o , although there were no significant differences in normal - sized ulcers ( table 3 ) . during follow - up ,
