in this study , we combined high - resolution brain structural mri and dti to investigate the existence and extent of cortical and wm plasticity in subjects with right lower limb amputation . in summary , we found specific motor and somatosensory plastic changes in amputees without plp and provided an update on the plasticity of the human brain involving both gm and underlying wm after limb injury .
, we first used a combined tract - based spatial statistics ( tbss ) and tractography analysis , which enables a precise characterization of both whole - brain wm and specific anatomical fiber tracts , to assess the microstructural changes in patients with unilateral amputation in the lower limb .
cortical thickness and fa values were used as measures to evaluate the gm and wm microstructural changes across the whole brain compared with normal controls . as a consequence , we found that patients with amputation at the right lower limb exhibited cortical thinning in the left premotor area and the right visual - to - motor regions . additionally , the integrity of the fiber tracts connecting the bilateral pmc and those underlying the right visual - to - motor regions was also significantly reduced in the patients .
