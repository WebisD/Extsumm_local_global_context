compared with a study conducted in neighboring ethiopia in 2005 , where mdr tb was found in only 1.6% of new and 11.8% of previously treated tb cases ( 9,10 ) , and with surveys conducted in countries of the eastern mediterranean region , where the average proportion of mdr tb in new and previously treated tb cases was of 3.4% and 29.9% , respectively ( 4 ) , the proportions of mdr tb detected in somalia are high . at this level of resistance
history of previous anti - tb treatment was the strongest independent factor for mdr tb ( odds ratio [ or ] 23.0 , 95% ci 9.456.1 , p<0.001 ) , and living in the south - central region or in puntland was associated with a significantly higher risk for mdr tb than was living in somaliland ( or 3.6 , 95% ci 1.96.9 p<0.001 for living in puntland and or 4.3 , 95% ci 1.711.3 , p = 0.003 for living in the south - central region ) .
percentage change in total tuberculosis notifications by diagnostic center participating in the survey , somalia , 20072010 .
this finding presents a real emergency for the national tuberculosis control program considering the duration of second - line treatment ( > 2 years ) ( 11,12 ) , the current availability of such treatment in somalia for a only few patients , and the country s lack of laboratory capacity to diagnose drug resistance .
