unilateral aplasia of the sinus , and bilateral aplasia of both maxillary sinuses are reported .
also , atelectasis of the sinus due to chronic sinusitis can be diagnosed as aplasia or hypoplasia of the sinus . computed tomography ( ct ) scanning and also cone beam computed tomography ( cbct ) and endoscopic examination of the sinus are the necessary diagnostic tools to detect the underlying abnormality . in this study , three cases with unilateral hypoplasia of the sinus ,
radiological diagnosis of maxillary sinus hypoplasia and aplasia helps the otolaryngologists to differentiate that from chronic sinusitis and neoplasm .
a 68-year - old female was referred to the clinic of oral and maxillofacial radiology for cbct preparation , as pre - operative imaging for implant insertion in the maxilla .
she had a history of cleft lip and palate that was a result of disturbance in the first arch development and the congenital first arch syndrome can be a cause of aplasia of the sinus .
many of the patients with aplasia or hypoplasia of the maxillary sinus are asymptomatic and unaware of their conditions and it is identified on routine radiographs .
maxillary sinus hypoplasia can lead to diagnostic problems , especially in conventional radiographs because it can be misdiagnosed as mucosal thickening in infectious disease or neoplasms involving the sinus .
