although the impact of autophagy on tumor cells is still unclear and more studies are needed to prove the effects of autophagy in gastric cancer , recent research results suggest that autophagy may be a new target for combatting resistance of gastric cancer to therapy .
gastric cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer - related death in the world and almost two - thirds of the cases occur in asian countries , especially china and japan .
although the relationship between autophagy and cancer is still unclear , especially in the regulation of cancer development and progression , there has been much important progress in our understanding that autophagy may have important roles in the treatment of gastric cancer cells .
however , the main cause of treatment failure in gastric cancer is the development of multidrug resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies , which is at least in part related to the anti - apoptosis effect .
in recent years , the role of autophagy in cancer cells has been investigated extensively .
it is well known that the resistance of cell death is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells .
although current major therapies , including surgery and chemotherapy , have been widely used , the prognosis of gastric cancer is generally rather poor , with 5-year relative survival below 30% in most countries .
