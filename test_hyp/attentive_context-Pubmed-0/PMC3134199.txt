this may indicate a role for il-15 in the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis late - phase reaction and the promotion of eosinophilic inflammation .   in ar disease ,
results are discussed in relation to the possible novel therapeutic effect of vitamin d in downregulating this inflammatory event , and the possible role for nk cells in the pathophysiology of ar .
, our results may indicate the following : a novel role for nk cells in the pathophysiology of ar through recruiting eosinophils ,   a novel modulatory role for il-15 in inducing eosinophils chemotaxis from ar patients through the nk cells secretagogue activity ,   identifying il-8 as an important cytokine that contributes to the eosinophilotactic agents secreted by nk cells ,   indicating that vitamin d3 may be an effective therapeutic modality .  
				
our results open channels for other researchers to further elaborate on the exact mechanism(s ) involved in nk - induced il-8 modulation by il-15 and vitamin d3 and p38 map - kinase inhibition .
this is consistent with an earlier study that demonstrated that vitamin d3 repressed il-8 promoter activity induced by tnf- in human melanoma cell line by 50% compared to 30% inhibition by dexamethasone , as well as tnf--induced il-8 release and il-8 mrna level .
