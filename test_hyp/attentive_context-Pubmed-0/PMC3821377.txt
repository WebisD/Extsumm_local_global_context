the primary aim of this study was to determine whether reported paracetamol dose was predictive of the need for nac .
this may improve the risk assessment in patients with paracetamol poisoning allowing the earlier administration in large overdoses or more targeted use of nac in early and late presenters .
patients who presented later had a higher rate of hepatotoxicity ( 5.5% vs. 0.4% ; p < 0.0001 ) , were more likely to have a paracetamol concentration above the nomogram ( 33.6% vs. 18.2% ; p < 0.0001 ) and more likely to receive nac ( 47.6% vs. 23.0% ; p < 0.0001 ) .
1 . sdac reduces the probability of nac by up to 14% at 28 g and less than 10% at either doses lower than 19 g or doses greater than 37 g. probability of the paracetamol concentration being above the nomogram line versus dose ( a ) for a 30-year - old female with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) sdac ; and ( b ) for a 30-year- old male ( solid line ) compared to a 30-year - old female ( dashed line ) .
the study shows that reported dose can be used as an early predictor of patients who require nac .
