the syndrome with ectrodactyly , ectodermal dysplasia , cleft lip and cleft palate ( eec ) is a complex disease with a variety of abnormalities of the ectodermal and mesodermal germinal layer . the first author who described this disease was eckoldt   in 1804 .
important hints may indicate an eec syndrome already in the clinical examination of the patient and in the investigation of family history .
dysplasia of the ectoderm arises in 77% of patients and clefts appear in 68% of cases .
whenever cases of eec syndrome occur , it is important , according to their phenotypic characteristics , to follow an interdisciplinary approach to reduce complications , to minimize undesirable sequelae and provide the best possible medical care .
the ectodermal component of this syndrome includes hair with hypotrichosis , hypopigmentation , the teeth with hypodontia , enamel hypoplasia and microdontia and ultimately the nails , which present themselves dystrophic in most cases .
