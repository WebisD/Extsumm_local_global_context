we present a case of lvnc in an adult patient with its clinical and imaging findings .
left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy ( lvnc ) is a very rare cardiomyopathy characterized by an increase in the noncompacted , trabeculated myocardium adjacent to compacted myocardium in the left ventricular ( lv ) .
recent cmri reports suggest a ratio of the noncompacted myocardium to compacted myocardium of > 2.3 yield the highest sensitivity ( 86% ) and specificity ( 99% ) in diagnosis .
a 24-year - old female patient was initially referred to our vascular department for investigation of bilateral lymphedema .
however , cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cmri ) provides a comprehensive depiction of cardiac morphology in any imaging plane .
the use of delayed hyperenhancement sequences improves the correlation between cmri and the parameters of the clinical stage of the disease .
bellet and gouley described the first case of noncompaction in an autopsy of a newborn infant with aortic atresia and coronary  ventricular fistula .
some trabeculae show delayed hyperenhancement despite having a normal compacted to noncompacted myocardial ratio , suggesting that lv noncompaction may be a more diffuse disease process than previously suspected .
though current research suggests a developmental arrest in embryogenesis as the underlying pathology , the etiology of lvnc are not fully understood .
