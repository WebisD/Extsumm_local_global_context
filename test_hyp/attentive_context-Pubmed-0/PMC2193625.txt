however , it remains to be tested whether aid edits separate pre - mrnas for csr and shm , and thus is involved in different steps in the two genetic events . in the present study we provide the evidence that hypermutation takes place in the unrearranged ig s region under the condition that induces csr but not shm in the v region gene .
on the other hand , in csr , two switch ( s ) regions located 5 to heavy - chain constant ( ch ) region genes are cleaved and a large dna fragment between the cleavages is excised out from the chromosome to bring in a downstream ig ch region gene to the proximity of a rearranged v gene ( 7 ) .
we then analyzed the sequence of the s region in aid b cells infected with aid virus .
in addition , neither shm nor csr is prerequisite of the other ( 8 , 9 ) . therefore , it is striking that a defect of aid , a putative rna editing enzyme , virtually abolishes both shm and csr without affecting germinal center formation ( 10 , 11 ) . to explain this unexpected finding , we have proposed a model that aid edits a precursor mrna to synthesize an endonuclease essential for generating dna cleavages in both shm and csr reactions ( 12 ) .
