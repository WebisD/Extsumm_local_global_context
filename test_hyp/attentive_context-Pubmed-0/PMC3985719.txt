in summary , we have described a copper - catalyzed amidation of unactivated 
 alkanes by benzamide , sulfonamide , carbamate , phthalimide , and their 
 derivatives .
our mechanistic 
 data imply that the tert - butoxy radical , not a copper - nitrene 
 or copper - aminyl species , leads to the activation of aliphatic c 
the amidation of alkanes under our catalytic conditions 
 preferentially forms the products from amidation at secondary sites 
 over tertiary sites .
we report the reactions of common amides , carbamates , and 
 imides 
 with alkanes to form n - alkyl derivatives with simple 
 copper catalysts and a peroxide ( scheme 1 ) . 

potential cu(ii)-amidate and -imidate 
 intermediates were isolated , characterized , and demonstrated to be 
 intermediates for c  h amidation of cyclohexane .
mechanistic data from the stoichiometric reactions 
 of isolated copper amidate or imidate complexes indicate that the 
 transformation of alkanes to n - alkyl products likely 
 occurs by the reactions of a alkyl radicals with copper(ii ) amidate 
 and imidate complexes .
although copper - catalyzed reactions at allylic 
 and benzylic c  h bonds with carboxylic acids and sulfonamides 
 in the presence of peroxides is well - known ( karasch - sosnovsky reaction ) , and the mechanism of these reactions has been studied , the amidation of c
