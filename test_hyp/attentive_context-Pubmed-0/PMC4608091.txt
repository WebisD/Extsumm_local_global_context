even when adjusting for co - morbidities ( elixhauser index ) , bmi still affected mortality ( hazard ratio for underweight group 1.39 , ci 1.26 to 1.53 ) .
underweight patients had a significantly higher risk of death ( hazard ratio , 1.35 , 95% ci , 1.23 to 1.49 ) compared with patients with normal weight , as did morbidly obese patients ( hazard ratio , 1.12 , 95% ci , 1.06 to 1.19 ) .
for example , adjusting for age ( eg , underweight comprised the oldest bmi group ) , bmi independently influenced mortality ( hazard ratio for underweight group 1.62 , ci 1.48 to 1.79 ) .
the validity of bmi as an accurate adiposity measure has been questioned , given muscle mass decline with age,49,50 as it does not account for body composition or the location of adipose tissue.5153 nevertheless , several studies have shown that the obesity paradox exists with any measure of adiposity.24,51,5456 the definition of the bmi categories in the current study are closely based on who and health canada guidelines ( with the exception of  underweight  being considered as bmi < 18.5 in these guidelines).13,14 these definitions reflect relative levels of risk to health.14 following the results of this and other studies confirming an obesity paradox in various clinical situations , we suggest that traditional bmi categorization may need to be revisited . in summary , although obesity is a well - recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease , overweight and moderately obese patients showed improved outcomes following cabg and cabg / avr with respect to patients with
