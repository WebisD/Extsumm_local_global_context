continuous care delivery demands that health care providers lead patients smoothly through a chain of care that includes a number of professionals , departments and organizations , each of which are necessary for the provision of quality care at the right time and in the right place for each and every patient   . experience has taught us that this process is complex . indeed , in countries like sweden , england , the netherlands and austria , hospitals struggle with a bed - blocking problem .
a bed - blocker is a patient who has completed treatment in one part of the care chain ( e.g. a hospital ) and is waiting for admittance to the next part of the chain ( e.g. a nursing home or home care ) .
the case studies were derived from qualitative data gathered in a larger mixed methods research project , using questionnaires and interviews with top - managers that addressed the availability of icds in all dutch hospitals and their functioning in terms of patient flows , waiting times , manpower , task division and responsibilities .
, this paper seeks to firstly explain the theory of bm and then discuss the tenability of our previous assumptions given the results of ( explorative ) research recently conducted .
