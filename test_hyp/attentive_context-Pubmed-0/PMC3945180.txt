this hypothesis was tested , with study 's objectives , to develop and to present a newly developed surgical intervention of labium minus labioreduction to determine applicability of this procedure , to evaluate aesthetic surgical outcomes , and to assess potential complications of this procedure . today
in this study group , fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition surgical intervention can be executed effortlessly without complications and the method can be reproduced ; aesthetically , the new operation achieves very pleasing results and the procedure improves physical- , emotional , and social well being .
