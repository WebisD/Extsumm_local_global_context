this publication has presented the strenuous experimental journey to discover the first spectroscopic evidence for the existence of a bridging hydride in a [ nife ] h2ase s ni 
improved sample concentration , increased photon flux and ultra - low noise level in the apd detectors all set the foundation for a possible nrvs measurement of the weak ni 
the decision and insistence on searching in the then unlikely energy region of 620720  cm was the key step towards successful observation of the ni 
fe wagging mode has 2729 parts per million in intensity in comparison with the nuclear resonance peak , or 0.8% in comparison with a fe  s feature .
fe feature at 675  cm provided a critical observed reference for dft calculations and thus served as a key in the dft determination of the ni 
it will be of interest to other scientists who use synchrotron radiation for measuring dilute samples and/or weak spectroscopic features in general .
the existence / non - existence of the 675  cm peak for nir - h / nir - d identified the peak as a fe  h - related feature experimentally .
this article evaluates all the matters related to whether the feature is observable , where to search for a fe  h - related feature , whether the observation is reliable , and how the experiments identify the observed 675  cm peak as a fe  h - related feature .
