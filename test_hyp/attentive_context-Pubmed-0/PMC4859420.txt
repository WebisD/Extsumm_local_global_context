the present study used the quality of life core questionnaire ( qlq - c30 ) , self - rating depression scale ( sds ) , and self - rating anxiety score ( sas ) to compare the influence of psychological and behavioral intervention above and beyond a conventional nursing protocol on postoperative rai for patients suffering from dtc .
interestingly , when comparing both groups after rai , there was a significant increase on all functional scales ( physical , role , cognitive , emotional , and social ) and global quality of life in the intervention group ( p<0.05 ) .
as hypothesized , patients who were subjected to psychological and behavioral intervention reported significant improvement in their quality of life ( as shown by their qlq - c30 scores ) , as well as reduced depression and anxiety symptoms ( as reflected in their sds and sas scores ) .
of the 30 participants in the routine nursing group ( male : 7 , female : 23 ) , 27 had papillary carcinoma and three had follicular thyroid carcinoma ; the average age was 51.6513.01 . for the remaining 30 participants in the psychological and behavioral intervention group ( male : 8 , female : 22 ) , 26 had papillary carcinoma and four had follicular thyroid carcinoma ; the average age was 50.9210.58 .
