a simple lateral view x - ray shows the dislocation , and absent radial and ulnar pulses insures that an arterial injury is present . in our case , the x - rays were normal , and the patient had normal pulses on presentation .
a high index of suspicion should be maintained by the emergency physician in evaluation for neurovascular compromise in all cases with elbow dislocation , especially in cases where the x - ray is normal . in most of the times ,
posterior elbow dislocation is the most common type of elbow dislocation with slightly higher incidence in the male population and they constitute 1025% of all injuries to the elbow among persons with a mean age of 30 years .
to our knowledge , the combination of occult elbow dislocation with intimal injury of the brachial artery in a 71-year - old male makes this case to be the first reported in the literature . in conclusion , palpable pulses after elbow dislocation should not rule out arterial injury and arteriogram should be done in case of suspicion of vascular injury as it is the gold standard of diagnosis in these injuries .
