, this information could be applied to the design of therapeutic options and prevention strategies for this devastating disease .    in this review , we first summarized data on the properties of calpains and the mechanisms underlying their activation . then , we reviewed findings on the dysregulation of calpain in the context of ad and its deleterious consequences for the morphology and function of affected brain areas .
furthermore , these findings underscore the importance of calpains as potential targets to block the activation of the signaling cascades leading to degeneration in ad . in turn
alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the abnormal activation of calpains might modulate not only the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also the development of synaptic pathology in ad .
more recently , data have been obtained on the molecular mechanisms that link the formation of these lesions and underlie neurodegeneration and cell death in ad and related disorders .
the diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disease relies on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in affected brain areas at autopsy .
