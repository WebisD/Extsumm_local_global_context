we used functional 
 near - infrared spectroscopy ( fnirs ) to compare the patterns of neural activity occurring 
 during the illusion of motion evoked by vibrating a tendon with these 3 devices .

, we believe that the illusion of motion evoked by vibration 
 stimulation of a tendon could be effectively utilized in a clinical setting for prophylactic 
 and rehabilitative purposes . furthermore , our result showing that the illusion of motion can 
 be reliably evoked using a handy massager within the optimal stimulation frequency indicates 
 the possibility of making the technique easily accessible and affordable for a large number 
 of patients in a variety of clinical settings .
in this study , we found no significant difference in the intensity of the evoked illusion 
 or in the range of the illusion of motion between the 3 conditions ; furthermore , the 
 illusion intensity and range of illusion of motion were significantly correlated under all 3 
 conditions .
