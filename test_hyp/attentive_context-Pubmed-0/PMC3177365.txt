for many patients with multivessel disease , pci is a definitive alternative to coronary artery by - pass graft ( cabg )   .
although complete revascularization remains a desirable goal in multivessel disease patients , incomplete revascularization strategy may be a preferred treatment strategy and a common clinical practice in many selected cases , when wisely chosen , because of its easier achievement and lower immediate risk . among these incompletely revascularized patients , mpi is able to identify those patients with ischemic and viable myocardial regions , in which a  functionally complete revascularization  is needed to improve their outcome ( figure 7 ) .
however , complete revascularization may not be possible in many patients , either because of the operator inability to treat all diseased coronary arteries such as chronic total occlusions and adverse stenosis morphology or simply being not easy to plan in the presence of coronary narrowing less than severe ( > 50% but < 70% ) .
indeed , clinical reasons for this decision include , among others , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction , severe left ventricular dysfunction , urgent / emergent pci , preexisting renal failure for which the amount of angiographic contrast media should be limited , and   premature termination of the procedure for unexpected problems , such as in those elderly or frail patients who can not lay flat for prolonged periods .
