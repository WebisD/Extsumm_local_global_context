it was shown that the bond strength of fiber post to root dentin was not affected by the mechanical cycling and different surface treatments of root canal dentin .
based on the results presented in this research , push - out bond strength for the cervical region was higher than that for the apical region .
results of three - way anova indicated that bond strength of fiber post to root dentin was not affected by the factors of  mechanical cycling 
forty - eight straight , single - rooted , human maxillary central incisors and canines were selected for this study .
( p=0.549 ) ,  surface treatment of root canal dentin  ( p=0.279 ) and their interactions ( p=0.774 ) ; whereas ,  region of the root canal  as the main factor showed significant differences ( p=0.004 ) .
moreover , in measuring the bond strength with the micro - tensile test , more premature failures occurred compared with the push - out test .
the interactions of mechanical cycling and region of the root canal and also surface treatment and region of the root canal was not significant ( p>.05 ) .
push - out bond strength for cervical regions was higher in comparison with the apical regions ( p=0.004 ) .
