rats fed with hfds containing mufa and -3 pufa had significantly lower weight gain , food and calorie intake and these changes were associated with increased fasting plasma dag concentrations , concomitant with lower insulin concentration and insulin resistance .
results of this study suggest that hfds containing fish oil and olive oil can increase the dag which may play a role in weight , appetite control and insulin resistance improvement in young rats .
these findings are comparable with the buettner ( and coworkers ) study in which they have shown that groups with higher weight gain , had higher plasma glucose levels and less effective insulin - induced glucose disposal.2
as , documented , ghrelin and insulin are two gut hormones playing an affective role in body weight regulation;6 dag could hence decrease food intake and gastric emptying in mice and rats.51 food intake modulator actions in the central nervous system have been suggested for insulin.5253 according to the findings of this study , food intake , calorie intake and weight gain were lower in groups with higher dag , which is consistent with recent report that dag induces a negative energy balance by decreasing food intake and delaying gastric emptying.51 on the other hand , in groups with higher insulin concentration and insulin resistance , food intake , calorie intake and weight gain also were higher .
