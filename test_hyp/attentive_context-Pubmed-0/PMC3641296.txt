many efforts are ongoing to improve the performance of the direct method making it faster and cheaper . here , to this purpose , we designed a new strategy and developed a new cost and time - effective approach for the assessment of brca mutational status .
b schematic representation of the experimental method for brca1/2 testing , showing the key role of the robotic station in the future , third - generation sequencing technologies , such as those used by pgm ion torrent of life technologies   or illumina , might contribute to lowering the costs of brca screening even more , but at present their use for diagnostic purposes is still very controversial and needs further testing .
the sequence analysis showed that our methodology of investigation was able to detect and to confirm the 100  % of the mutations previously found in both brca1 and brca2 genes for each of the samples .
the whole testing requires a time of about 2 working days , representing a rapid and cost - effective method .
b schematic representation of the experimental method for brca1/2 testing , showing the key role of the robotic station flow chart showing our experimental conditions . a flow chart showing the timing of all the protocol steps including : dna extraction , amplification of 73 amplicons covering all the coding regions of brca1 and brca2 , pcr analysis through gel electrophoresis , purification of amplification products , setup of sequencing reaction , purification of sequencing products , and sequencing by capillary electrophoresis .
