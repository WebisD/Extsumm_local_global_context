we review recent results indicating that dexh / d proteins can directly target rna  protein interactions both in vivo and in vitro and that rnp remodeling does not necessarily require rna duplex unwinding . based on the available data , we outline a basic mechanism by which dexh / d proteins may displace proteins from rna .
nonetheless , physiological functions of many dexh / d proteins correlate with the ability of the enzymes to hydrolyze atp in an rna - stimulated manner , and/or to unwind rna duplexes in vitro in an atp - dependent fashion ( 16 ) . for these reasons , and because of the intuitive connection between the unwinding of rna secondary structure and conformational changes in rnps , it has long been assumed that rna helicase activity is central to the biological function of dexh / d proteins .
one group of enzymes pivotal for facilitating rearrangments of cellular rnps are the dexh / d proteins ( 11,12 ) .
these enzymes are known to manipulate rna structure in an atp - dependent manner ( 13 ) .
in fact , dexh / d proteins are frequently referred to as rna helicases . however , because cellular rnas are invariably complexed with proteins , dexh / d proteins are most likely to encounter rna  protein complexes , rather than the pure rna duplexes that are commonly used to measure rna helicase activity in vitro ( 4,16,17 ) .
