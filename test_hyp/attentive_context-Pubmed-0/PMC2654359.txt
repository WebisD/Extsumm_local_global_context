this review provides an overview of h. pylori - induced inflammation and the molecular and cellular events of tumor microenvironment that underlie gastric cancer .
both the complex host / microbial interaction and growth factor / cytokine networks induced by h. pylori are mediated by the microenvironment that is an indispensable player in the multistage process of gastric carcinogenesis .
the most significant advance in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer is involved with the recognition of the role of h. pylori as the most important etiological factor for gastric cancer .
these events of abnormal growth factor / cytokine networks in the tumor microenvironment will no doubt provide a great deal of information on new approaches for biomarkers and effective therapeutic targeting of gastric cancer .
recent evidence indicates that a large number of genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes , tumor suppressor genes and genetic instability as well as telomerase activation determine a multi - step process of gastric carcinogenesis   .
the global burden of gastric cancer is shifting rapidly from the developed world to the developing world .
however , these molecular events found in gastric cancer differ depending upon the two histological types , intestinal and diffuse types of gastric carcinoma , indicating that intestinal and diffuse type carcinomas have distinct genetic pathway .
