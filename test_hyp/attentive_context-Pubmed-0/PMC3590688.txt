the type and frequency of education barriers were evaluated , and variables associated with reporting an obstacle were analyzed .
in our questionnaire , we used a likert scale for determining severity of three domains as the barriers of patient education that ranged from 0 to 4 .
twenty questions were about their working situation , 4 questions about hospital educating facilities , and 12 questions were about patients situation in hospital .
the purpose of this study was to explore nurses attitudes to the barriers of patient education as a right for getting information based on work situation of nurses , educational facilities in hospitals , and patients situation .
the interactions of patient , physician and systemic factors have implications for the implementation of patient education .
generally , it was obvious that educational condition in our hospitals was not good and most of the nurses believed that patient education is not their duties , facilities in hospitals are not sufficient and shortness of time is the most important cause of insufficiency of patient education
the failure of adequate patient education may be attributed to the lack of patient adherence , the failure of nurses knowledge and skill level or the insufficient funding and organization of necessary programs in the current health care system .
