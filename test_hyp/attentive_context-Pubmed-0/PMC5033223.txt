since these are regulated activities in india , it is important for geac and rcgm to remain apprised of these changes so that risk assessment guidance , supporting resources , and outreach and training of stakeholders can be appropriately modified . in order to proactively identify emerging issues that may impact the risk assessment and risk management functions of the indian biosafety regulatory system , moef&cc conducted a survey to understand the nature and diversity of genetically engineered crops ( also referred to as transgenic crops herein ) that may move to product commercialization within the next 10  y. this is the first comprehensive overview of the r&d pipeline for ge crops in india .
the questionnaire was comprised of 2 categories of questions : ( 1 ) general questions related to information about the respondent 's institution and r&d activities ; and ( 2 ) specific questions to provide information about specific transgenic plants currently under development ( see box  1 ) .
in india , the regulation of genetically engineered ( ge ) organisms is prescribed in rules notified by ministry of environment and forests ( now the ministry of environment , forests and climate change ; moef&cc ) , government of india on december 5 , 1989 under the environment ( protection ) act 1986 .
