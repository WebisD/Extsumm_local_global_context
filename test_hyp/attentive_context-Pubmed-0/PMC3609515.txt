with progression of cfrd , treatment modalities and glycemic control become more similar to t1 dm , whereas differences in auxological parameters persist .
significant differences were also found for self - monitoring of blood glucose ( smbg ) per day ( t1 dm , 4.6 ; cfrd , 3.7 ; p < 0.001 ) and number of visits per year ( t1 dm , 3.30 ; cfrd , 2.12 ; p < 0.001 ) .
cfrd patients were shorter ( height sds , 1.30 ; 2.25 to 0.43 ) and had lower body weight ( weight sds , 1.51 ; 2.49 to 0.68 ) , resulting in a lower bmi ( bmi sds , 0.85 ; 1.59 to 0.12 ) compared with t1 dm patients ( height sds , 0.04 ; 0.72 to + 0.63 ; weight sds : + 0.43 ; 0.23 to + 1.09 ; bmi sds , + 0.52 ; 0.10 to + 1.16 ; all p < 0.001 ) .
differences in auxological parameters persist 5 years after the diagnosis of diabetes with height sds of 1.60 ( 2.84 to 0.69 ) , weight sds of 1.73 ( 2.51 to 0.83 ) , and bmi sds of 0.92 ( 1.63 to 0.40 ) in cfrd compared with t1 dm ( height sds , 0.01 [ 0.67 to 0.65 ] ; weight sds , 0.48 [ 0.14 to 1.11 ] ; bmi sds , 0.57 [ 0.01 to 1.17 ] , all p = 0.0001 ) .
