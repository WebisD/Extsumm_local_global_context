according to our results , we suggest that early intervention with crrt before urine output is reduced to less than 500 ml per day may be beneficial in the treatment of tbi patients with impending arf . to define the therapeutic advantages of early crrt in the tbi patients with arf , a well - designed and controlled study with more cases
we aimed to investigate the outcomes of crrt on tbi patients in whom arf developed after trauma , and to study relevant factors which influence patients survival .
the causes of death were tbi - related in 8 , sepsis due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) in 4 , and multi - organ failure in 10 . among the various factors related to survival , 24-hr urine output before receiving crrt ( 500 ml vs. < 500 ml ) ( figure 1b ) , the presence of sdh ( figure 1c ) , and iss ( < 25 vs. 25 ) were significant after univariate analysis ( figure 1d , table 2 ) .
meq / l ) , severe acidosis ( ph < 7.15 ) , lactic acidosis related to metformin use and anuria with diuretic resistant volume overload.710 ) however , to our knowledge , there are no previous reports regarding indications for initiation of crrt for arf in patients with tbi . in our study , it was found that starting early crrt before when the urine output is reduced to less than 500 ml per day significantly prolonged survival time of tbi patients with post - traumatic arf .
