therefore , we hypothesized that cys on 17-hsd1 may represent a target site for novel inhibitors . in the present study , we applied 3d structure modeling and enzyme activity measurements to investigate the biochemical properties of cysser mutant 17-hsd1 and to compare its sensitivity towards sulfhydryl modifying agents with that of wild - type 17-hsd1 .
the preincubation with increasing concentrations of nadph was able to protect 17-hsd1 from inhibition by the sulfhydryl modifying agents nem and dithiocarbamates , suggesting an indirect role of cys in stabilizing the binding of the cofactor .
the slight increase in the apparent km of 17-hsd1 mutant cysser for estrone , observed in our measurements in cell lysates , indicates a decreased affinity for the substrate as a result of disturbed interactions with the cofactor nadph . a careful structural comparison between the interactions of residues with the cofactor and substrate in 17-hsd1 , 11-hsd2 , and ( r)-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase should offer an explanation for the different effects of the modification of the analogous cysteine residues of the three sdrs . in human retinol dehydrogenase
nevertheless , the results demonstrate a reduced stability of the mutant compared with the wild - type enzyme .
