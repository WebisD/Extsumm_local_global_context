therefore , this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intraoral application of lllt 
 ( 660  nm ) in controlling pain intensity , swelling and interincisal opening in oral 
 surgery .
however , a reduction in pain intensity was observed immediately after the third 
 postoperative day , reinforcing the possible effect of lllt on pain ( friedman test , p = 
 0.001 ) .
additionally , on the seventh day , the patients were asymptomatic . even though the 
 patients with a greater surgical duration had a slight increase in pain intensity on the 
 first day , it was not statistically significant ( spearman s correlation , p > 0.05 )
similarly , an increase in swelling was observed 
 when comparing the initial condition and the first postoperative day ( friedman test , p = 
 0.01 ) .
was observed during the application days in this study , which is 
 in agreement with the results of a previous study by markovi and todorovi25 , who reported pain reduction by 
 application of a gaalas laser after surgical removal of third molars , suggesting a 
 dose - dependent effect .
further studies are needed , 
 especially randomized controlled clinical trials , to help elucidate the impact of laser 
 therapy after third molar extraction and establish the ideal parameters for lllt as an 
 assessment tool in this promising therapy field .
