most of them were young , and four of them had accompanying schizophrenic symptoms such as visual hallucination or delusion . in the current study , we report a 24-year - old man , without a known psychiatric history of psychotic or affective disorder , who developed a unique , brief psychotic disorder following ingestion of small quantities of alcohol , which seems very different from pi .
patients with alcohol abuse and dependence may suffer from psychiatric disorder , and there is a high prevalence of alcohol and other drug use disorders among patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders  shown to be as high as 50% in some studies.13 a high prevalence of alcohol abuse and substance use disorders has also been found in patients with first - episode psychosis.4,5 while alcohol - induced psychotic disorder is a well - recognized clinical disorder , relatively little is known about the mechanism of this condition .
in the present report , we described the case of a young patient who presented with three episodes of behavioral change of acute onset suggestive of the brief psychotic episodes .
one possible reason for this could be that acute ethanol ingestion in our patient was associated with an acute decrease in gaba concentrations of the brain , and studies ( in humans and animals ) have shown that gaba deficits may induce stress and anxiety.19,20 taken together , this case demonstrates a special presentation of a marked behavioral change , which is suggestive of an episode of brief psychotic symptoms , after ingestion of small quantities of alcohol .
