the present review covers the recent literature on plant gene expression in bacteria , yeast , insect cells and xenopus   oocytes and presents the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each system .
it also provides a survey of recent examples of application of heterologous expression technology to plant proteins .
examples are provided by the synthesis of a medicinal peptide from ginseng as potential drug against diabetes   or production of plant lectins   in both cases in yeast .  
foreign hosts may also provide a simpler system for studies on functions of proteins and for elucidation of their roles in complex mechanisms such as metabolic reactions and membrane transport .
this methodology allows large - scale production of plant proteins in microorganisms to study their biochemical and biophysical features .
factors influencing the choice of hosts , including the stability and folding characteristics of the protein , requirement for posttranslational modifications , efficiency of the expression system , as well as simplicity and cost are discussed in the following sections .
expression systems are selected depending on whether the purpose of study is production of large quantities of protein or investigation of functional features of the cloned protein .  
heterologous expression of plant genes in other host organisms has two main applications : ( 1 ) overexpression of the encoded protein , for biochemical and biophysical characterization and ( 2 ) expression of foreign genes for determination of the function of the encoded protein by complementing in a mutant host .
