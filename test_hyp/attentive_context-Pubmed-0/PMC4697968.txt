this study aimed to examine the risk of vte , including both dvt and pe , in patients with gout .
the risk of dvt was significantly increased in gout patients with comorbidity ( hr  =  1.45 , 95% ci  =  1.171.79 ) and in gout patients without comorbidity ( hr  =  2.27 ,
cox proportional hazards regression analysis for the combined effect of gout and comorbidity on the risk of dvt and pe the combined effect of gout and each comorbidity ( atrial fibrillation , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , stroke , heart failure , fracture of lower limbs with / without operation , all cancer , and pregnancy ) on the occurrence of dvt ( a ) and pe ( b ) .
these estimates are comparable to those of the effect of gout on cvd , which emphasizes the importance of gout as a risk factor for dvt and pe . besides , the risk of dvt was higher in gout patients without comorbidity than in gout patients with comorbidity , and the risk of vte in gout patients with any single comorbidity was markedly higher than that in reference subjects without gout but with any combination of 2 comorbidities .
