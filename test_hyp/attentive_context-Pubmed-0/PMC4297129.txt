has been shown to maintain preoperative contact stresses for a given loading regimen . in this short communication , we report the treatment of a patient s kienbck s disease by combining mri with mathematical modeling to optimize the congruency between the curvature of donor and recipient sites of an autologous osteoarticular plug transfer .
we treated kienbck s disease with the aid of a 3-dimensional model of femoral articular surface and calculated the principal curvatures of the surface .
this case report presents the unique application of mri and mathematical modeling when applying the autologous osteoarticular transfer procedure to the lunate .
the purpose of this study was to describe the feasibility of a novel surgical technique .
the results indicate that donor site selection for autologous osteoarticular transfer using a quantitative evaluation of articular surface curvature may be beneficial for optimizing the likelihood for restoring the radius of curvature and thus joint articulation following cartilage repair .
kienbck s disease , defined as avascular necrosis of the lunate , is a relatively rare condition with a poorly understood etiology .
these techniques require only an additional limited 3-dimensional model of the knee with minimal scan time beyond the routine examination of the wrist for assessment of marrow viability and the integrity of the articular surfaces .
