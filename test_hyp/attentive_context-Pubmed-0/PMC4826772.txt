we explore questions pertaining to the neurobiology of intrusive thoughts , and how we might use this neurobiology to facilitate treatment of a number of neuropsychiatric diseases that are characterized in part by intrusive thinking .
because of recent neurobiological advances in animal models of addiction , this review will utilize drug addiction as an exemplar neuropsychiatric disorder for understanding the biological basis and pharmacological treatment of intrusive thoughts .
? why do people with neuropsychiatric disorders have difficulty controlling intrusive thoughts that trigger undesirable behaviors ? how can the neurobiology of intrusive thinking be used to identify molecular targets for treating neuropsychiatric disorders characterized in part by intrusive thoughts ?
is intrusive thinking adaptive in some situations where highly motivating stimulus demands a restricted focus on a single behavioral response
intrusive thoughts are characteristic of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders , such as obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) , posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , depression , schizophrenia , body dysmorphic disorder , eating disorders , and drug addiction .
it is clear that discovering the neurobiological underpinnings of how a thought becomes intrusive and can initiate maladaptive behaviors could have farreaching therapeutic impact on a number of disorders . while not likely to cure any of the disorders , a treatment rendering intrusive thoughts more controllable and less likely to trigger unwanted behaviors would broadly support current pharmacological and psychosocial therapies in many neuropsychiatric disorders . in this review ,
