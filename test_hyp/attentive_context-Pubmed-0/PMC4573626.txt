we therefore conducted the current study to evaluate survival rates of patients with colorectal cancer following a procedure performed by high - volume surgeons compared to low - volume surgeons .
in the current analysis we found that a high - volume surgeon is an independent prognostic factor for increased dfs for colorectal cancer surgery when compared to a low - volume surgeon .
it is possible that , with either more patients included or a longer follow - up time , this observed difference will also become statistically significant for os . to our opinion , introducing high - volume surgeons will provide better perioperative care for patients suffering from colorectal cancer resulting in both improved short - term and long - term results .
surgeons ' volume showed to be an independent prognostic factor for dfs in favor of the high - volume surgeon ( hr 0.739 ; 95% ci 0.560.99 ; p = 0.04 ) .
also the conversion rate in case of laparoscopic surgery was significantly lower in the high - volume group ( 18% versus 27% , p = 0.01 ) .
possibly in a larger cohort of patients we may show an increased os in the future since os did show to be significantly increased in the high - volume surgery patients in the univariate analysis .
