occlusal x - ray film holder and skull positioned for standardized occlusal 
 radiograph the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a 
 radiographic analysis method for identifying the location of mini - implants inserted in 
 the posterior region of the maxilla in dry human skulls .
these 
 results support the use of this standardized method for occlusal radiographs for 
 mini - implant identification on the posterior maxilla .
intra - operator reliability for mini - implant measurements expressed as interclass 
 correlation coefficient ( icc ) ( n=3 ) the icc test verified the measurements of each variable made by each operator on each 
 skull that localize the head and the tip of the mini - implant ( x , y , x ' and y ' ) . 

( 2005 ) used dry human skulls to analyze the reliability 
 in determining tooth position in posterior - anterior films .
the goal of the present study was to test the reliability and accuracy of the 
 radiographic occlusal position developed by zanda ( 2007 ) used as a device to verify the stability of 
 posteroanteriorly and lateromedially positioned orthodontic mini - implants .
intra - operator correlations were above 0.87 for all the operators and each of the skulls 
 ( table 2 ) .
