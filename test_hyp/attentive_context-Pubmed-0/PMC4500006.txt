the primary findings of this 
 study were that : 1 ) the high group (  8,000 steps / day ) had significantly greater toe 
 grasping strength , but not knee extension strength , when compared with the low group ( < 
 8,000 steps / day ) strength , 2 ) toe grasping strength was significantly associated with daily 
 step count , and 3 ) toe grasping strength significantly correlated with light plus moderate 
 intensity physical activity , but not moderate plus vigorous intensity physical activity .
relative toe grasping strength correlated positively with light ( r = 0.320 , p 
 < 0.05 ) , moderate ( r = 0.345 , p < 0.01 ) , and vigorous ( r = 0.296 , p < 0.05 ) 
 physical activity . relative knee extension strength correlated positively with moderate ( r = 
 0.298 , p < 0.05 ) , and vigorous ( r = 0.358 , p < 0.01 ) physical activity , but not with 
 light ( r = 0.203 , p = 0.131 ) physical activity . similarly , both toe grasping and knee 
 extension strength correlated with light plus moderate physical activity as well as moderate 
 plus vigorous physical activity ( table
