isotretinoin is a systemic synthetic retinoid used to treat moderate to severe nodulocystic acne vulgaris that is not responding to other therapies , as well as a number of other dermatologic diseases , including psoriasis , hidradenitis suppurativa , ichthyosis , lesions associated with lupus erythematosus , some cases of severe acne rosacea , and various skin cancers , or even adjunctive therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia.1 among other adverse effects , isotretinoin has repeatedly been associated with depression , suicidality , and psychotic symptoms , although the link between isotretinoin use and psychiatric events remains controversial.2 remarkably , when affective psychosis and obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) occur following isotretinoin treatment , associated psychopathology is generally severe and eventually poorly responsive to conventional treatment , as highlighted by recent , large , retrospective studies.3 also , although patients suffering from bipolar disorder may be at increased risk for mood symptom exacerbations due to isotretinoin therapy , including suicidal ideation , even with a concurrent antimanic therapy,3 less is known about the risk for developing ex novo affective psychosis and antidepressant manic vulnerability when isotretinoin treatment is used during adolescence . furthermore , acne itself often occurs during adolescence , and can be eventually induced by lithium , a standard treatment for bipolar disorder , which , in turn , usually has its onset at the same age .
