it is expected that the over - expression of nrf2 in mscs will protect the mscs against the unfavorable conditions of the infarcted tissue ( such as oxidative stresses ) , increase their survival rate in the infarcted tissue , and improve their function in repairing the injured tissue .
improved heart function following the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) has been reported in animal models of acute mi as well as in clinical studies on patients with heart failure ( 9 ) .
myocardial infarction ( mi ) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality , resulting in 12.8% of deaths worldwide ( 1 , 2 ) .
cellular cardiomyoplasty is a new potential therapeutic approach that uses exogenous cells to repair regions of damaged myocardium .
many therapeutic options , ranging from pharmaceutical therapeutics to mechanical procedures , are available for acute myocardial infarction ( 3 ) . reactive oxygen species ( ros ) play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases . many studies have reported an association between such diseases and oxidative damage to cardiac cells .
we hypothesized that over - expression of nrf2 in mscs ( nrf2-mscs ) , can effectively improve the efficiency of the transplantation of mscs , thereby enhancing cellular cardiomyoplasty . nrf2 over - expression can protect mscs against oxidative stresses encountered in the microenvironment of infarcted tissue .
