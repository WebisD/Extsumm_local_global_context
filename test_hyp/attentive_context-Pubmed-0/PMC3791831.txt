antioxidant and antidiabetic   , heart inotropic , usefulness in treatment of menstrual bleeding , antitussive , tracheal relaxant , and relaxing activity   are the other effects that attributed to rosa damascena l.   considering the beneficial effects of quercus infectoria and rosa damascena l. reported in the literature , the administration of these agents especially in the eastern societies is growing . in the present study we investigated the effects of chronic administration of quercus infectoria and rosa damascena l. on the hemodynamic , heart performance , lipid profile , and plasma atherogenic indices of rabbits with / without hyperlipidemia to elucidate the outcome of a long - term consumption of these agents on the cardiovascular system .
this study aimed to assess the influence of the chronic administration of a methanolic extract of two famous herbal drugs , that is , rosa damascena l. and quercus infectoria , on hemodynamic , heart performance , lipid profile , and plasma atherogenic indices of rabbits with / without high - fat diet .
in addition , the use of rd along with a high - fat diet increased the risk of hypertension in rabbits .
yet , in those animals which received a combination of rd and high - fat diet , systolic , diastolic , and the mean arterial pressures increased significantly whenever it was compared to its corresponding groups , that is , the ctl , rd , and h. in this study , the high - fat regimen alone or plus qi had no significant effect on the blood pressure compared to its matching groups ( figure 3 ) .
