in this review , we discussed and summarized the known interactions between mirs and genes involved in tgf- , notch , and wnt signalling pathways and highlighted a signature of 30 validated mirs linking these pathways to the process of emt .
our novel approach led to the identification of a cluster of validated and known mirs involved in different pathways in an attempt to reduce the extraordinary volume of information related to the interaction between mirs and different target genes .
we believe that the identification of groups of genes targeted by the same mir and the clustering of these genes in different pathways could potentially represent an interesting strategy to better understand the cross talk between multiple signalling networks , thus facilitating the understanding of their connections and their role in a common biological process .
the focus of this review is to summarize the validated groups of mirs functionally linked to the cross talk between tgf- , notch , and wnt signalling during the common biological process of epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) . in particular
we identify published and validated interactions between mirs and genes involved in tgf- , notch , and wnt signalling .
