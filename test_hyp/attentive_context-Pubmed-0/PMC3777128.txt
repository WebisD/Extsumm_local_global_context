no published literature , however , answers the question of gender differences specifically in acute hemorrhagic stroke . since acute nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage ( ich ) contributes greatly to the poststroke morbidity and mortality burden on the health system , we sought to determine gender differences in an exclusive cohort of first time hemorrhagic stroke patients presenting to our emergency department .
female gender is an independent predictor of early mortality and bad functional outcome at hospital discharge , after adjusting for age , stroke severity , volume of hemorrhage , and intraventricular extension of hemorrhage , all of which are known to predict worse outcome .
also , we have reported a greater inclination for females to experience a right hemispheric ich than males , which could influence functional recovery and mortality outcomes .
all adult patients who presented with a diagnosis of spontaneous nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage ( ich ) , from january 2006 to december 2008 , were eligible for inclusion in the study cohort .
we ran a logistic fit incorporating all these variables in a multivariate analysis and found that female gender remained an independent predictor of poor outcome at discharge ( adjusted or = 2.30 , 95%  ci 1.04 to 5.25 ; p = 0.0398 ) and death within 7 days of ich ( adjusted or 3.03 , 95% 1.24 to 7.79 ; p = 0.0144 ) .
