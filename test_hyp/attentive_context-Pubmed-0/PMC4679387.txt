the preventive strategy for cervical cancer is based on identification and treatment of high - grade cervical lesions ( hg - cin ) in order to prevent cancer progression .
although most of the commonly used assays were sensitive for detection of cin2 + disease after therapy 67 , 68 , it is necessary to be aware of the performance of the system , observing strict standardization of the process and adhering to quality assurance criteria .
all of the authors of the present review use , in their own institution , validated hpv - test ( hc2 , cobas 4800 or abbott real time ) in a strategy as shown in table 3 to follow cin2 + treated patients .
since hg - cin recurrence after surgical therapy is a major marker for progression to invasive cancer , the strategy and procedures of follow - up represent a critical point for risk stratification .
is considered a powerful tool for managing the post - treatment follow - up of high - grade cervical intraepithelial lesions .
conversely , women negative for hpv type - specific persistence are considered at very low risk for recurrence , leading to a more individualized follow - up schedule . in table 3 , a flow - chart for surveillance of hg - cin , with an integration of hpv genotyping and cytology 6 months after conservative treatment , is suggested . in conclusion , the excellent clinical performance of the combination strategy with hpv genotyping and cytology
