the author described how they managed their patient with laparotomy and resection of a perforated small bowel .
internal herniation of a small bowel behind the external iliac artery after lymphadenectomy is a very rare complication to this procedure and to our knowledge only reported twice in the literature . in the first paper published in 1978
this is the first case in the literature where laparoscopically reduction of the internal herniated bowel underneath the iliac vessel is performed .
the hernia orifice was closed by using a free peritoneal graft harvested from the under surface of the anterior abdominal wall .
strangulated internal hernia behind the iliac vessel is a rare entity only reported twice in the literature .
para - aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy is often performed in the treatment of ovarian or testicular cancer .
a 56-year - old woman underwent in 2008 prophylactic bilateral laparoscopic salpingoophrectomy because of a mutation in brca1 gene .
a quick recovery with no complications , short hospital stay and minimal discomfort postoperatively made our approach an acceptable surgical option for this patient .
this patient had to undergo several surgical procedures to re - establish blood flow to the extremity because of trombosis of the iliac artery .
