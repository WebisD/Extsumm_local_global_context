thus , the aims of this study were to investigate whether metal interferes with the surface hardness and roughness of a visible light - polymerized acrylic resin and to compare these values to those of water - bath- and microwave - polymerized resins .
within the limitations of this in vitro study , it may be concluded that the presence of a metal framework did not interfere with the roughness and knoop hardness of the tested visible light - polymerized ( triad ) , microwave - polymerized ( onda cryl ) and water - bath - polymerized ( clssico ) acrylic resins , indicating that all materials can be used in removable partial dentures .
comparisons between acrylic resins showed that the visible light - polymerized resin ( triad ) exhibited significantly higher means ( p<0.05 ) .
means and standard deviations for acrylic resin surface roughness m ) are presented in table 2 . the visible light - polymerized resin ( triad ) showed the highest means ( p<0.05 ) , but the metal alloy did not interfere with surface roughness .
. means and standard deviations for knoop hardness ( kg / mm ) of acrylic resins at several distances from the metal are described in table 3 .
