, we describe an unusual microgranular apl case associated with ider(17)(q10)t(15;17 ) , identified by both conventional cytogenetics and fish analyses at the initial diagnosis .
a 59-yr - old woman who had previously been diagnosed with cerebral infarction was brought to our hospital due to right side weakness in november 2007 .
acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) is one of the most characteristic subtypes of aml in which abnormal promyelocytes predominate within peripheral blood or bone marrow .
about 1% of the reported secondary cytogenetic abnormalities in apl patients are ider(17)(q10)t(15;17)(q22;q12 ) , an infrequent type of additional recurrent chromosomal abnormality , according to a recent study . however , ider(17)(q10)t(15;17 ) associated with the pml - rara rearrangement in microgranular variant apl is even more rare . as far as we know ,
seventy to eighty percent of newly diagnosed apl patients with the pml - rara rearrangement are cured or under long - term remission , yet some of them have a poor prognosis [ 2 - 5 ] . because cytogenetics is one of the most powerful prognostic factors for the outcome of aml , cytogenetic abnormalities can cause change in treatment response , relapse , and clinicopathological characteristics .
