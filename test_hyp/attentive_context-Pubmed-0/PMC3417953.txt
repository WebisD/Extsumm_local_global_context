unilateral sensory and motor block , a faster recovery profile , and a stable hemodynamic state can be achieved with doses of 5 mg and 7.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% injected slowly through pencil - point directional needles in patients who are maintained in the lateral decubitus position for 20 minutes .
the patients were randomly allocated into four groups ( n = 20 each ) receiving different doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% .
however , 7.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% was the dose required for adequate unilateral spinal anesthesia with adequate sensory and motor block .
the choices of anesthesia are as varied as the operations done through the scope , and include general blocks , central neuraxial blocks , peripheral nerve blocks , and intra - articular local anesthetic techniques.1 in the last decade , bupivacaine has been the most frequently used agent for spinal and epidural anesthesia.2,3 in ambulatory surgery , such as diagnostic knee arthroscopy , bupivacaine may delay the recovery of motor function and cause urinary retention , leading to delayed discharge.4,5 unilateral spinal anesthesia is frequently used in lower limb surgery.6,7 several advantages are claimed for this anesthetic technique , including fewer hemodynamic complications,8 selective block on the operated side , avoidance of unnecessary paralysis on the nonoperated side , better mobilization during the recovery period , lower incidence of postoperative urine retention,9 as well as good patient satisfaction.10 to achieve successful unilateral anesthesia , several factors are required , including needle shape and bevel direction , site and speed of injection of anesthetic , volume , baricity , and concentration of the anesthetic solution , as well as an appropriate degree of operating table inclination.11,12 moreover , patient posture is thought to be fundamental in determining the level of anesthesia spread , particularly when a hyperbaric anesthetic solution is used.13 previous studies have failed to determine the ideal dose of local anesthetic to achieve unilateral spinal anesthesia . therefore , our aim was to evaluate the influence of the dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine on the success of unilateral spinal anesthesia by assessment of maximum sensory and motor block on the operative and nonoperative sides during knee arthroscopy and its effect on hemodynamics .
