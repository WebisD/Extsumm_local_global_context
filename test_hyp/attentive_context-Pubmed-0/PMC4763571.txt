hence we have used a combination of photopatch test and uv - irradiated indian standard series ( iss ) in our study , to detect light - induced antigens in patients with photosensitive dermatitis .
a total of 35 patients were included in the study during a one year period between september 2012 and october 2013 .
minimal erythema dose or med is the least amount of uv radiation required to produce perceptible erythema on light exposed skin .
9 ( 50% ) showed contact allergy , 4 ( 22% ) had photoallergy , and 5 ( 28% ) had contact dermatitis with photoaggravation to p. hysterophorus .
the patch test results were evaluated using the international contact dermatitis research group ( icdrg ) grading .
detailed results of the 18 patients who showed positive photopatch test results six patients had contact dermatitis without any photoaggravation or photoallergy to varied antigens such as potassium dichromate , chinoform , fragrance , para - phenylenediamine , nickel , and cobalt .
the highest number of photopatch reactions was noted with parthenium , with 18 ( 51% ) patients showing positive results .
the detailed results of the 18 patients with a positive photopatch test suggestive of photodermatitis are shown in table 1 . out of the 18 patients ,
