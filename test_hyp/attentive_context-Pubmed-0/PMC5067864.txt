superior vena cava isolation in those with trigger mediated atrial fibrillation following pulmonary vein isolation ( pvi ) is performed to enhance long - term outcomes .
a 64-year - old female underwent superior vena cava ( svc ) isolation after triggers were identified originating from the svc following pulmonary vein isolation ; immediately after svc isolation , she developed junctional rhythm with symptomatic hypotension requiring emergent management .
we present the first case of time course of recovery of sinus node function , injured during svc isolation .
apical motion abnormalities were noticed in the echocardiography suggesting stress - induced cardiomyopathy which resolved 48 hours later . although received a dual chamber pacemaker , intact sinus node function returned 2 weeks later .
premature beats arising from foci other than pulmonary veins have been related to its pathogenesis .
premature beats arising from svc triggering af is infrequent but when present has to be approached cautiously due to proximity of phrenic nerve and inadvertent sinus node injury .
atrial fibrillation ( af ) is the most common sustained arrhythmia ; its incidence increases with aging .
ours is the first report of sni associated with pvi  +  svci where time course of recovery of sinus node function was noted .
