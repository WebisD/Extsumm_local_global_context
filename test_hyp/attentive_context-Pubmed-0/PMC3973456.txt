consequently , the objective of this study was to compare the results of oral and vocal 
 fold ddk of dysphonic women to the results of oral and vocal fold ddk in women without 
 vocal disorders .
although the results do n't indicate any difficulties in oral and laryngeal motor control 
 in the dysphonic group , the major instability in vocal fold ddk in the experimental 
 group should be considered , and studies of this ability in individuals with 
 communication disorders must be intensified .
comparison of oral and vocal fold diadochokinesis ( ddk ) average and standard 
 deviation , between dysphonic and nondysphonic women , in the emissions of " pa , " 
 " ta , " " ka , " " pataka " , " a , " and " i. "
although the findings did not show a statistically significant correlation of oral and 
 vocal fold ddk between the group of women with and without voice disorders ( table 1 ) , some aspects about the performance of 
 diadochokinetic tasks are relevant and should be discussed .
it was expected that no neurological changes related to 
 vocal production would interfere with oral and vocal fold ddk , since for both tasks 
 there was participation of the opening and closing of vocal folds , especially related to 
 " a " and " i " emissions , that involve specifically alternating motions of glottic 
 adduction and abduction , since organic and functional factors may also interfere with 
 the results of the ddk , including not necessarily expressing a disturbance in oral 
 communication .
