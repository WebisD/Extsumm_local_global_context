we previously showed that macrophages from the 129 and balb / c mouse strains preferentially phagocytosed eshps in vitro . here , we extend those findings and present evidence which supports that host macrophages are an innate immune barrier to eshp engraftment in vivo .
macrophages have been observed to respond and phagocytose cells of the embryonic inner cell mass , escs , and cultured esc derivatives   .
our observations that eshps are phagocytosed by host macrophages in vitro and that clodronate treatment promotes higher donor chimerism from eshps in mice in vivo strongly suggest that eshps stimulate innate immune responses and that control of macrophage - induced immune rejection should be considered in the field as new hematopoietic derivatives are produced from escs or esc - like induced pluripotent stem cells for in vivo transplantation .
strategies to skew polarization of macrophages toward proinflammatory m1 versus regulatory m2 phenotypes are currently being explored for clinical applications ( although further studies are required to determine the m1 versus m2 phenotype of the f4/80 macrophages in the eshp  nsg chimeras ) . to our knowledge , a comparison of the expression levels and functional abilities of macrophage inhibitory ligands and in the nsg versus 129 strains has not been performed . however , there is evidence of mouse strain differences in the binding of the ability of the nod , balb / s , and b6 forms of sirp to bind to the human macrophage inhibitor receptor cd47 and prevent phagocytosis of xenogeneic cells in mice .
