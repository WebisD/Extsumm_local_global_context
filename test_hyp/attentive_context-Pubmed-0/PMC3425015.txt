nevertheless , we have shown that fasting insulin levels in subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes have been decreasing progressively from 2000 to 2009 , and this decrease has been associated with an increase in mrfs , particularly wc and bmi . in conclusion , the superimposition of low pancreatic -cell reserve upon a lifestyle background of metabolic parameters appears to result in hyperglycemia and diabetes in japan .
in this 10-year study of drug - naive japanese diabetic patients evaluated at their first clinic / hospital visit , fasting insulin levels were found to decrease over time , with wc and bmi being the most important factors after corrections . from 2000 to 2009 , when the current study was conducted , a diabetes status survey in japan also estimated an increase in the number of diabetic patients , from 6.9 to 12.5 million ( 3 ) .
further analysis using ancova adjusted for age and fpg showed differences among year groups , with an increase in bmi and a decrease in fasting insulin ( p < 0.001 ) . in each year group , bmi and fasting insulin values in females were higher than in males ( p < 0.001 ) .
