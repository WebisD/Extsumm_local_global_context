in this community - based population , we found that elevated a1c even in the range under 6.5% was associated with heart failure risk independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in middle - aged individuals during a median of 14 years of follow - up .
elevated a1c ( 5.56.0% ) was more strongly associated with increased risk of heart failure as compared with fasting glucose in a middle - aged bi - ethnic population without diabetes .
the risk conferred by 1% unit increase in a1c in our study was 39% and was slightly higher than what has been reported in populations of people with diabetes ( 36 ) .
given that the association between a1c and heart failure risk was somewhat attenuated by limiting to heart failure cases without preceding chd , elevated a1c apparently confers heart failure risk partially through its association with increased chd risk ( 22 ) .
our findings suggest that chronic hyperglycemia even before the development of diabetes is an independent risk factor of heart failure and may contribute to the development of heart failure beyond its effect on chd risk .
second , we repeated our analyses after excluding participants who had incident diabetes in the first 6 years of follow - up ( between visit 2 and visit 4 ) defined by a fasting glucose of 7.0 mmol / l , nonfasting glucose of 11.1 mmol / l , self - reported physician diagnosis of diabetes , or use of glucose - lowering medication at visit 3 or visit 4 ( n = 600 ) .
