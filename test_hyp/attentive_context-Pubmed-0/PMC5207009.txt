, we examined the association between sp - a , sp - b , and sp - d polymorphisms and the risk of rds in premature infants to understand the contribution of sp - a , sp - b , and sp - d polymorphisms to rds risk .
further study revealed statistically significant differences between the case group and the control group in the genotype and allele frequencies of 2 snps of sp - a , + 186a / g and + 655c / t , and sp - b 1580c / t ( all p<0.05 ) .
our findings suggested that sp - a + 186a / g and sp - b 1580c / t polymorphisms are strongly correlated with an increased risk of rds , while sp - b 18a / c , sp - d met11 thrt / c , and ala160 thrg / a polymorphisms were not associated with rds in preterm infants .
in the present study we examined multiple snps of sp - a ( + 186a / g and + 655c / t ) , sp - b ( 18a / c and 1580c / t ) and sp - d ( met11thrt / c and ala160thrg / a ) for their association with rds risk in preterm infants .
