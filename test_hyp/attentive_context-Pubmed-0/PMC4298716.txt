the mean cbi sub - scale scores were : time - dependence burden , 13.0  6.2 ; developmental burden , 7.6  6.4 ; physical burden , 6.2  5.1 ; social burden , 4.4  4.0 ; and emotional burden , 4.5  4.7 .
all caregivers reported mild to moderate burdens , ranging from 0 to 79 using bi ( mean ; 37.8  22.2 ) and 3 to 87 using cbi scores ( mean ; 35.7  23.0 ) .
the total npi score did not differ between male and female patients ( male vs. female = 24.4  24.2 vs. 22.6  24.3 , p = 0.729 ) , and we observed no associations with age ( r = 0.004 , p = 0.980 ) , disease duration ( r = 0.062 , p = 0.678 ) , levodopa equivalent daily dose ( r = 0.032 , p = 0.827 ) or mmse score ( r = 0.090 , p = 0.542 ) .
delusion , hallucination , agitation and aggression , anxiety , irritability and lability , and aberrant motor behavior were associated with greater caregiver stress ( table 2 and 3 ) . for the npi clusters , caregivers of groups with irritability , agitation and psychotic symptoms ( clusters 4 and 5 ) , reported more severe stress or burden ( table 4 ) .
