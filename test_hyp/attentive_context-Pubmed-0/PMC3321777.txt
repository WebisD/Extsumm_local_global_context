in addition , infestations of guinea pigs and rabbits with larvae and nymphs from the 4 generations and adults from the third generation confirmed that ticks of these 3 developmental stages from the 4 generations were infected by r. rickettsii because all infested guinea pigs and rabbits became infected by r. rickettsii , which was confirmed by seroconversion through ifa or pcr in addition to compatible clinical data .
in the study reported here , r. rickettsii was preserved by transstadial maintenance and transovarial transmission in a. aureolatum ticks for 4 consecutive generations , because all tested eggs , larvae , nymphs , and adults from the infected group were shown by pcr to contain rickettsial dna , from the first to the fourth generation .
because both the infected and control ticks were siblings derived from the same field - engorged females used to start a laboratory colony , reared under the same laboratory conditions during the whole study , we conclude that the lower survival and reproductive performance of infected females was a result of a deleterious effect caused by the r. rickettsii infection .
all infected egg pools tested by pcr yielded rickettsial dna , indicating a transovarial transmission rate ( the proportion of infected females giving rise to at least 1 infected egg or larva ) of 100% among r. rickettsii  infected females . because all the individual larvae from the infected group tested by pcr also yielded rickettsial dna , a filial infection rate ( proportion of infected eggs or larvae obtained from an infected female ) of 100% is also likely to have occurred .
