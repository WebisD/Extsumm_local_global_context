this report suggests a possible association between the use of ada and the incidence of pneumonia , which is a severe and often fatal infection .
rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is an obstinate , systemic inflammatory disease which has a negative impact on the quality of life.1 anti - tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) therapy has proved to be beneficial to ra patients because it can suppress inflammation and joint damage;2 therefore , the percentage of ra patients treated with ant - tnf agents is steadily increasing .
to our knowledge , this is the first reported fatality triggered by relapsing pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila with deep mycosis and ip in an ra patient treated with ada .
, however , it seems that the risk of l. pneumophila pneumonia may be increasing in ra patients receiving tnf antagonist therapy.3 we report a rare case of pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila in an ra patient after only two ada injections .
adalimumab ( ada ) , a fully human anti - tnf monoclonal antibody , exhibits excellent effectiveness in ra ; however , its use has been reported to cause many adverse events in ra patients .
