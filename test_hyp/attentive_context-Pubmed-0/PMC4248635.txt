this lesion manifested as subchondral cysts according to the initial radiography images , and led to further evaluation by computed tomography ( ct ) arthrography and immediately obtained magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scan that revealed overlying articular cartilage defects .
a 20-year - old female patient was referred to our hospital from a local hospital .
osteochondral lesions of the femoral head are uncommon , and few studies have reported the imaging findings of such lesions . since this condition occurs in relatively young patients , and osteochondral damage puts joints at high risk of subsequent degeneration ( 2 ) , timely recognition of this disorder is important for proper treatment . herein , we review previous literature related to osteochondral lesions of the femoral head and 796report a case in which lesion involving the bilateral femoral heads was observed .
radiologists should look for bony lesions associated with articular cartilage defects in the femoral head , which could be indicative of an osteochondral lesion , similar to the lesions that are known to occur in the knee or the talus .
osteochondral lesions involve the articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone , and most often affect the knee and the talus ( 1 ) .
