this study reports that the addition of pectinase and cellulase alone or in mixtures enhanced the virulence of f. compactum on broomrape .
a semiaxenic polyethylene bag system was used that allowed easy visual observation of the fungal infection of the tubercles .
since both enzymes separately enhanced the severity of tubercle infection , it was ascertained whether the pathogenicity of f.   compactum ( 1.4  10  propagules  ml ) on broomrape tubercles could be synergistic through the joint action of the enzymes ( 10  u  ml of each enzyme ) ( figure 3 ) .
the f. compactum treatment ( 1.05  10  propagules  ml ) that caused only a hypersensitive reaction ( 9% death ) on the tubercles caused about 35 to 85% tubercle death when the tubercles were treated with mixtures that contained mycelia , pectinase , and cellulase in various ratios ( figure 4 ) .
this system ensures easy examination of seedling attachment to the tomato roots and easy observation of tubercle infection in the course of the experiment .
higher tubercle infection by f. compactum was observed with a high ratio of cellulase to pectinase .  
a mixture of both enzymes with f.   compactum increased fungal infection of broomrape by f.   compactum ( figure 3(e ) ) .
