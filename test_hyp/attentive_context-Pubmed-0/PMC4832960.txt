but the relationship between h. pylori and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) is still unclear , and the effect of h. pylori eradication on gerd treatment is unknown . in this study , we selected patients with reflux esophagitis to explore the effect of h. pylori and its eradication on reflux esophagitis treatment .
although we found that h. pylori eradication itself has no significant effect on erosive esophagitis treatment , the asia - pacific consensus on h. pylori infection mentioned that long - term use of ppi therapy causes increased risk of gastric atrophy , which is a precancerous lesion . for patients with gerd , ppi is used for a long time , therefore , h. pylori therapy is recommended . in this study , patients were followed - up for only 8 weeks , and we plan to continue follow - up for years in order to determine the changes by h. pylori eradication therapy ; reflux esophagitis and relapse of reflux symptoms will be monitored , as well as gastric pathology .
reflux symptom scores in the h. pylori positive eradicated and h. pylori positive uneradicated groups were 8.04 and 7.13 , respectively ( p = 0.062 ) .
