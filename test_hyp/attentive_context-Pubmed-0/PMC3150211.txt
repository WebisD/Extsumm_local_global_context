the focus is on the molecular mechanisms regulating postnatal gabaergic circuit development and the onset of critical period plasticity , followed by a brief discussion on how aberrations in inhibitory circuit development and alteration in the timing of critical period plasticity could be implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases .
additionally , this line of inquiry may help us develop rational pharmacological approaches to correct alterations in the brain of children with neurodevelopmental disorders involving altered synapse formation and/or plasticity .
studies on mechanisms that underlie activation and regulation of critical periods in the central nervous system ( cns ) are seminal in neuroscience , with the underlying motive being that manipulation of such mechanisms may potentially allow reactivation of neural circuit plasticity during times when the adult brain is less plastic , for example , to aid adaptive circuit rewiring following insult , such as stroke .

				  more than four decades of research has demonstrated that although the brain remains plastic throughout life , continuously reorganizing its connections in the face of new experiences , childhood represents a specific phase in the development of the synaptic network that is characterized by overall remarkable plasticity . during this period of enhanced plasticity also called  critical period  , experience can produce permanent , large - scale changes in neural circuits .
