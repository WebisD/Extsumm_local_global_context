we compared the effects of these diets on the development of dental caries in a diabetic rodent model focusing on the difference in hardness between the powdered and pelletized diets .
, food hardness could have an effect on the development of dental caries in diabetic rats , and appropriate consideration of the food formulation should be made in experimental caries studies using diabetic rodent models .
in addition , in the diabetic rats fed with the powdered diet , all of their molars ( 100% ) were affected with caries , and the mean caries score was 3.7 , which was significantly higher ( p < 0.01 ) than the diabetic rats fed with the pelletized diet ( table 1 , figure 4 ) .
histopathologically , the severity of the carious lesions in the diabetic rats fed with a powdered diet was significantly enhanced compared to the diabetic rats fed with the pelletized diet ( table 2 ) . in control non - diabetic rats , slight carious lesions , which were macroscopically and radiographically normal ,
thus , the effect of food hardness on the different diets in caries development in diabetic rats may become clearer when the dental caries mildly develop during the more early stages . in conclusion
