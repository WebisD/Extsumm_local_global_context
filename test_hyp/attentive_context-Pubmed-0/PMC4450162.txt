this study was designed to assess the efficacy of routine treatment of amr / tma in iranian kidney transplant recipients , comprising of plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) .
the tma is always the most important differential diagnosis of amr ( 8) . the gold standard for exact diagnosis is renal biopsy ( 9 ) ; however , in many patients , performing kidney biopsy is not feasible due to the patient s low platelet count and lack of personal satisfaction . in these situations ,
our suggestion is to reduce ivig dose after each plasmapheresis to 100 mg / kg ( i.e. replacement dose ) to reach the cumulative dose of 2 g / kg . if plasmapheresis treatment is held sooner than the completion of ivig cumulative dose of 2 g / kg , the remaining dose can be administered during one injection .
kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients who suffer end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) .
due to a series of similarities in clinical and laboratory features of amr and tma in kidney transplant recipients , the unavailability of dsa assessment in iranian laboratories , high risk kidney biopsy in several patients , especially in those with thrombocytopenia , and delayed pathology reports of renal biopsy in several iranian kidney transplant centers , it seems reasonable to start amr and tma management concomitantly , in clinical situations .
