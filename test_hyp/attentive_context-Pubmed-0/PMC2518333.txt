in addition , these women should be counseled regarding lifestyle interventions that may improve bone health , including adequate intake of calcium and vitamin d , and exercise .
bmd at the total hip and femoral neck remained lower than in control subjects after adjusting for age , bmi , and oc use , even with no significant decrease in bmd from baseline to follow - up ( table 2 ) .
the baseline study demonstrated that the older cohort had significantly lower bmd at the femoral neck and lateral spine than age - matched control subjects ( 7 ) .
when evaluating for associations between metabolic control and bmd measurements that were statistically lower in case than in control subjects at follow - up ( table 2 ) , the pearson correlation coefficient ( r value ) for a1c and bmd was between 0.121 ( total hip ) and 0.334 ( femoral neck ) ( p > 0.095 , data not shown ) .
significant differences in bmd were identified at the total hip , femoral neck , and whole body in the case subjects 20 years of age compared with the control subjects . as in the previous report , no differences in bmd were seen between groups in the younger cohort . in the adjusted model ( for age , bmi , and oc use ) , bmd values at the total hip ( baseline , p = 0.003 ; follow - up , p = 0.007 ) and femoral neck ( baseline and follow - up , p <
