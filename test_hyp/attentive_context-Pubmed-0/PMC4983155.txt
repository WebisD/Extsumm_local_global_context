this study was designed for the assessment of metformin usage in the prevention of bladder cancer recurrence after the trans - urethral resection of a bladder tumor ( tur - t ) .
to our knowledge , the present study is the first one to evaluate the efficacy of metformin on bladder tumor recurrence after tur - t .
from april 2013 to september 2014 , all patients referred to baqiyatallah hospital with the diagnosis of a bladder tumor who underwent tur - t were included in this study .
that smoking , dm , previous surgery on the genitourinary tracts , tumor histology , and stage and grade were not statistically different between the 2 groups , but the tumor pedicle type ( papillary or sessile ) was statistically different ( p value < 0.05 ) .
it was revealed that 8 ( 25% ) patients in group 1 and 10 ( 30.3% ) in group 2 had tumor recurrences during the 1 year follow - up period , and this rate is not statistically different ( p value = 0.633 ) .
there was no correlation between sex , dm , and tumor grade with tumor recurrence , but age and tumor size had a weak positive correlation with recurrence in group 1 , and a weak negative correlation with recurrence in group 2 .
