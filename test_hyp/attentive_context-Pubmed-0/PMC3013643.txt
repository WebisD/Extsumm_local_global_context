in a recent nih whitepaper ( 1 ) the lack of a comprehensive , curated carbohydrate structure database was identified as the largest deficit in glycomics and glycobiology research .
, different valuable collections of carbohydrate data have emerged over recent years , for example : the bacterial carbohydrate structure database ( bcsdb ) ( 4 ) that collects all published bacterial carbohydrate structures ( including their nmr spectra ) ; the database of the consortium for functional glycomics ( cfg ) that provides access to primary experimental data like that from glycan microarray screens ( 5 ) ; and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) that contains glycan - related biosynthetic pathways ( 6 ) .
in 2005 , a new initiative was begun to overcome the isolation of the public carbohydrate structure databases and to create a comprehensive index of all available structures with cross - links back to the original databases . to achieve this goal ,
structures of the freely available databases were translated to the glycoct sequence format ( 7 ) , if possible , and stored in a new database , the glycomedb ( 8) . the integration process is performed incrementally on a weekly basis , updating the glycomedb with the newest structures available in the associated databases . a java software application called glycoupdatedb , which is complemented by a postgresql database ,
