in addition , it has stimulated the development of national guidelines ( particularly for adults ) for the disclosure of results . for hiv
given the experience we have described , we conclude that it is feasible to obtain hiv and hsv-2 biomarker data for adolescent hiv prevention intervention studies . in particular
we present two clinical trial case studies to examine important issues related to adolescent biomarker data collection in two clinical trials in kenya and zimbabwe ( hallfors et al . ,
together these studies provide a valuable opportunity to examine the ethical and practical challenges of biomarker procedures within hiv prevention intervention clinical trials in developing countries .
our experiences conducting research with orphan adolescents in kenya and zimbabwe suggest that collection of hiv and sti test results even in rural , resource - poor settings in sub - saharan africa is a feasible addition to the behavioral research toolkit .
specifically , we describe the challenges faced by investigators in the two cases in developing and implementing ethical procedures for informed consent , biomarker testing , and disclosure of test results .
research is urgently needed to examine the risks and benefits of hiv testing and disclosure of test results in the context of a research study for adolescents . further development and implementation of sti biomarker assessment techniques  particularly pertaining to using dbs  is needed to advance hiv prevention science .
