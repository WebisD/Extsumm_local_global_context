our findings from this pilot study suggest that pharmacist home visits following a hospitalization can aid in identifying medication - related problems .
this report presents our findings in delivering this intervention during a 6-month period occurring between august 2011 and february 2012 .
the ability to identify such problems may be enhanced when pharmacists work together with patients to review and enter the discharge medication list into an ephr system .
the frequency and clinical significance of the problems identified suggests a need for increased involvement of pharmacists during care transitions .
the percentage of medication - related problems detected by the pharmacist was higher among those patients agreeing to use the ephr system ( 15/20 , 75% ) , as compared with patients who did not use the ephr ( 4/10 , 40% ) .
in 2012 , the american pharmacists association and the american society of health - system pharmacists jointly issued a white paper entitled  improving care transitions : optimizing medication reconciliation.5 in this paper , these organizations describe an expansive vision for medication reconciliation , one that is  composed of multiple processes that together reduce medication errors , support safe medication use by patients , and encourage community - based providers and those practicing in hospitals and health systems to collaborate in organized medication reconciliation programs to promote overall continuity of patient care  .
