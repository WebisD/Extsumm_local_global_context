this article reviews the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) techniques available for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with cerebral metastases .
the evidence regarding the use of advanced imaging techniques in cerebral metastatic disease is largely controversial with a variety of conflicting results regarding the different advanced imaging modalities .
, the majority of evidence suggests that quantitative metrics derived from pwi , dwi , dti or mrs of the peri - tumoural tissue may provide a supplementary means of discriminating hgg from cerebral metastases , and the use of a multimodality approach combining parameters derived from each of the advanced imaging techniques is likely to improve both the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity .
the majority of studies have focused on discriminating hgg from solitary cerebral metastases , with fewer studies attempting to differentiate metastatic lesions according to histological subtype , and therefore inform further imaging . at best
unfortunately , most of the current studies are limited with regard to their small patient numbers ( few have more than 30 patients for a given tumour type ) and the heterogeneous collection of histological types of cerebral metastases that are frequently grouped together . a large multi - centre trial is required to evaluate the usefulness of these combined advanced mr parameters in discriminating both gbm from cerebral metastases , and metastases of different histological subtype . in order to achieve diagnostic currency in the setting of busy clinical scanners ,
