our aim is to report our experience with a young adult patient with mibc and review the literature for the natural history and outcome .
our case demonstrates a rare example of a high  grade t2 transitional cell carcinoma in a 28 year male .
a 28year  old caucasian male patient with 10 pack  year smoking history with no family history of bca presented to the emergency department with gross hematuria and left flank pain .
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder in the first three decades of life is extremely rare .
diagnosis of bca in patients aged < 40 years is rare and is extremely rare in patients < 30 years of age .
bladder cancer ( bca ) is the fifth most common cancer in the united states . in 2012 , it is projected that 73,510 people will be diagnosed with bca and 14,880 will die from the disease .
quality of life and fertility preservation is particularly significant in young patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion .
radical cystectomy ( rc ) with urinary diversion ( ud ) is the ultimate curative treatment .
this tendency is more pronounced in patients presenting in the first three decades of life and is likely to decrease with age .
