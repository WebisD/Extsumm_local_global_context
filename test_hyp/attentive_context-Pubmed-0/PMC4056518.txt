for decades , urinary sodium ( nau ) was used to define the presence of structural damage to the kidneys in the setting of oliguria or azotemia .
in 2006 , a systematic review   revealed that nau values were widely variable within and between studies with no consistent values to distinguish normal kidney function , pre - renal azotemia and atn . a contemporaneous experimental study inducing hyperdynamic sepsis revealed progressively lower levels of nau .
therefore , these old paradigms gave place to a new paradigm : that nau is useless as a tool in aki management .
the authors concluded that nau was not a reliable marker of renal perfusion ( breaking the old ' pre - renal ' paradigm ) .
meq / l were considered markers of pre - renal impairment and above 40 meq / l as markers of intrinsic renal disease . recently , ' pre - renal ' and ' atn ' paradigms have been frequently criticized : first , because many cases classified as atn lack this finding in histopathological studies ; and , second , because increasing knowledge of acute kidney injury ( aki ) revealed a dissociation between renal hemodynamics and nau , especially in sepsis .
