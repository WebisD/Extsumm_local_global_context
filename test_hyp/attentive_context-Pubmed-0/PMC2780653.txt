this paper extends the literature on this topic by investigating the impact of hmo and ppo concentration on six different measures of services offered by metropolitan hospitals during the period 20012004 . taking all of the empirical results together
in fact , the empirical findings suggest that health insurers , when they possess more buyer clout , can negotiate additional inpatient days and outpatient visits without necessarily raising the number of personnel and labor expenses
the relationships between buyer concentration and the six different measures of hospital services are either direct or statistically insignificant .
( 2006 ) who find empirically that metropolitan hospitals are more efficient when health insurers dominate the health insurance industry at the state level .
because price data are unavailable for the test , we can not be sure if the ineffectiveness of hmos and ppos , with regard to influencing the provision of some types of hospital services like admissions or surgeries , holds because these buyers could not secure price discounts or because they were unable to affect health care provider behavior.4 or it may be the case that inpatient days and outpatient visits are more discretionary at the margin than the other types of services .
