therefore , we conducted a systematic review to clarify the use of diode laser in laryngeal diseases and outcomes shown so far .
the evidence from recent studies suggests an improvement in diode laser technology ( especially the 980  nm wavelength ) . further long - term multicenter prospective research is needed , although the findings of this review suggest that diode laser is a useful tool that should be considered in laryngeal surgeries .
lasers have been used in laryngeal surgeries since 1972 , when strong and jako first reported the use of carbon dioxide laser ( co2 ) in the human larynx.1 despite initial criticism , endoscopic laser treatments have achieved universal acceptance and been successfully used in endolaryngeal microsurgery ( ems).2 most of the laser procedures involve either excision or tissue vaporization , depending on the interaction between the wavelength (  ) and the chromophores of the tissue . for years , the co2 (   =  10600 nm ) seemed to be the preferred laser for transoral laser microsurgery due to its precise cut,3 given that it is better absorbed by water . however , there are some disadvantages of the co2 device , namely , its straight line beam delivery from surgical microscope , narrow penetration depth to tissue , difficult transportation , and increased cost .
