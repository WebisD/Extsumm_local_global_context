we highlight the importance 
 of developing a solid foundation for mapping with md , particularly 
 as it relates to the validation of parameters through detailed evaluation 
 of metrics for probe  probe dispersion .
we also 
 identify additional probe solvents that expand the ability of mixmd 
 to locate important interaction profiles in protein 
here , we 
 show what happens when poor parameters are used in mapping a protein . 

we then use md simulations of water - probe boxes to examine which remain 
 evenly mixed .
we were interested in extending the probe set for mixmd to 
 fully 
 enable identification of hydrogen - bonding sites , hydrophobic contacts , 
 protein  protein interactions , and aromatic pockets .
ultimately , investigators could  mix and 
 match  the probes used in mixmd to identify hotspots with a 
 greater degree of specificity .
the multiple solvent crystal structure ( mscs ) technique uses x - ray crystallography to determine receptor structures 
 in the presence of competing water and organic solvent .
, a full pharmacophore 
 model could be created from the simulation of a single protein+probes+water 
 system , which would greatly reduce the computational costs of mixmd 
 studies .
simultaneous 
 protein flexibility and solvent mapping was first 
 implemented in 2009 when molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations were 
 used as a tool to map hot spots .
