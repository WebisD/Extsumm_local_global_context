we used values pa = 0.05 , pe = 0 , rr1 = 1.5 , and rr2 = 1.5 so that the risk ratio between populations due to the influence of this risk allele was estimated to be equal to 1.050625 . using the seer incidence rates of prostate cancer in african americans ( 234.6 per 100,000 ) and non - hispanic whites ( 150.4 cases per 100,000 )
pa is the risk allele frequency in african origin populations , pe is the risk allele frequency in european populations and rr1 is the relative risk associated with carrying 1 copy of the risk allele ( compared to none ) and rr2 is the relative risk associated with carrying 2 copies of the risk allele .
the percentage of greater risk to african americans that may be associated with rs7210100 was estimated as 1-[(1.561.050625)/(1.56 - 1 ) ]  100 .
imputed snps in the 17q21 risk region , as shown in figure 2 , were examined in association with prostate cancer risk as described for typed snps above . in stage 2 , the snps were analyzed using logistic regression controlling for age and study ( in the pooled analysis ) .
