our research objectives were to assess the concentrations of il-13 and il-17 in serum of patients with era , the investigation of correlation between the concentrations of these cytokines and disease activity score and the concentration of some autoantibodies in relation to the control group , and the evaluation of the utility of il-13 and il-17 concentration measurements as markers of disease activity .
with il-13 and il-17 serum concentrations increasing proportionally with the disease activity of era , the highest concentrations were in patients with severe activity disease . based on the results of this study , we can conclude that the presence of higher il-13 , il-17 , igm - fr , and anti - ccp serum levels in patients , compared to those of controls , confirms that these markers , found with high specificity , might be involved in the pathogenesis of era . il-13 and il-17 might be of better usefulness in the prediction of era activity status than igm - rf and anti - ccp .
statistically significant differences were observed between both the moderate and the severe groups and a mild group ( p < 0.05 ) , as well as between the group with moderate disease activity and the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . in the studied cohort of patients , we observe statistically significant differences in the concentrations of crp and the levels of esr between patients with era and the control group ( crp / control group , p < 0.0001 ; esr / control group , p < 0.0001 ) ( table 1 ) . analyzing the relationship between serum levels of crp and esr and different disease activity stages , we observed only statistically significant differences between severe and moderate group ( p < 0.0379 ) ( table 2 ) .
