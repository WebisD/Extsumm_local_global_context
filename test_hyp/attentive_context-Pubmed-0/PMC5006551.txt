a woman who developed pityriasis rosea during her first trimester of pregnancy and who subsequently delivered a healthy baby with craniosynostosis is described , and observations of infants born to women who are diagnosed with pityriasis rosea during their gestation are summarized .
a 28-year - old healthy woman presented at 10 weeks gestation with a skin rash .
craniosynostosis is a congenital abnormality , which can occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome with other associated features .
pityriasis rosea is considered to be a benign cutaneous condition   . however , in the setting of pregnancy , adverse effects on the newborn may be observed .
whether the presence of craniosynostosis was associated with our patient s development of pityriasis rosea during her pregnancy remains to be determined .
her husband , a 29-year - old man , had presented two months earlier with similar - appearing annular lesions on his neck ( figure 2 ) .
similar to our patient , in the majority of cases of pityriasis rosea occurring in couples , the lesions appeared in the husband prior to the wife ( table 1 ) .
however , there are a similar number of reports of women who developed pityriasis rosea during their gestation and delivered normal newborns .
