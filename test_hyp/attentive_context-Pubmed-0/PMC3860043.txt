pregnant women , who have previously undergone lrbg , represent a diagnostic challenge when presenting with acute abdomen and internal hernia in this setting might be particularly risky . in this case , we present a 22-year - old woman , who had undergone lrgb and who suffered a massive internal hernia during pregnancy leading to short bowel syndrome .
in january 2012 , at 26 weeks of gestation , a 22-year - old woman was admitted to our surgical department due to sudden onset of upper abdominal pain .
when bowel necrosis is found it should be resected and in case of extensive bowel resection the patient should start parenteral nutrition , and an evaluation should be made in centres specialized in intestinal failure .
it is a severe complication , which can lead to massive bowel necrosis that may result in short bowel syndrome ( sbs ) and sometimes death .
since internal hernia is potentially life threatening for mother and foetus , both obstetricians and abdominal surgeons must be aware of this condition and surgery should be performed on a wide indication .
the literature provides other successful reconstructions after lrgb complicated with internal obstruction . a case report of a 44-year - old woman , who suffered from volvulus after lrgb , leaving her with an intact duodenum
