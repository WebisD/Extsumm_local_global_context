evolutionary events such as gains and losses of phosphosites can lead to changes in protein regulation , thus rewiring the protein regulatory network of the cell . in the literature
we test whether this second scenario could have contributed to the divergence of paralogous proteins using the yeast phosphoproteome as a model .
spectacular examples of such gains of function resulting from gene duplications are the evolution of trichromatic vision in primates , the evolution of human beta - globin genes that are involved in the oxygen transport at different developmental stages   as well as the expansion of the family of immunoglobulins and other immunity - related genes that shaped the vertebrate immune system   . because of the central role of gene duplication in evolution , there has been a profound interest for a better understanding of how these new functions evolve at the molecular level , for determining at what rate gene duplication occurs   and for testing whether the retention of paralogous genes necessarily requires the evolution of new functions   .
the biochemical properties of glu and asp mimic the ones of pser and pthr with the exception that their charge is not regulatable .
gene duplication is one of the most prominent mechanisms by which organisms acquire new functions .
