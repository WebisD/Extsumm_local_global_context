their transient nature and low populations at equilibrium under solution conditions commonly used in in vitro studies ( ph > 5 ) have precluded a direct characterization of these species at high resolution . in this paper , we use low ph conditions to provide such high - resolution structural evidence on the nature of the equilibrium thermal unfolding behavior of human lysozyme . using nmr spectroscopy in combination with a wide range of biophysical techniques , we studied three variants of human lysozyme that have variable stabilities and propensities to aggregate in vitro , namely the wt protein and the i56 t and i59 t mutants ( see figure 1).(29 ) as stated above , the i56 t variant is linked to familial lysozyme systemic amyloidosis , and the i59 t mutant has been designed to have properties that are intermediate between those of i56 t and the wt lysozymes .
we present here a comparative study of the complete thermal unfolding transition of the three variants i56 t , i59 t , and wt under relatively modest temperatures and in the absence of denaturants .
interestingly , both the native state destabilization and the extent to which cooperativity is lost within the denatured ensemble correlate with the amyloidogenicity of the variant in other solution conditions ( ph 5.0 ) , as well as with the expression levels of lysozyme in pichia pastoris.(29 ) although the results of this study do not directly report on the structural properties of the amyloidogenic state of lysozyme under physiological conditions , they strongly indicate that the propensity of human lysozyme to aggregate is closely related to the shape of the energy landscape of the monomeric protein,(25 ) that has been probed in the present study .
