herein , we describe a clinical scenario of instrument retrieval broken beyond the apex of a mandibular molar tooth using endo success ultrasonic tips .
the ultrasonic technique was successful in removing the rotary niti file fractured beyond the apex and the stainless steel h file from a mandibular molar tooth .
a 38 year - old female patient was referred by her local dentist to the endodontics department of manubhai patel dental hospital , for retrieval of a fragment of a niti protaper file ( f1 , dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) broken during root canal enlargement and embedded in the distal canal of the mandibular right first molar extending beyond the apex ( tooth # 46 ) . during clinical examination
one of the two intra - oral periapical ( iopa ) radiographs brought by the patient revealed incomplete root canal treatment of the right mandibular second premolar and first molar ( fig .
rotary nickel titanium ( niti ) files are extensively used for cleaning and shaping of the root canals because of their higher flexibility compared to stainless steel ( ss ) files . despite the superior qualities of niti rotary files ,
endo success retreatment kit consists of six titanium - niobium mini - tips , designed for retreatment available in different lengths and tapers .
