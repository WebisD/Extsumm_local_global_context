the present findings support the medicinal use of the roots of k. lappacea in the treatment of oropharyngeal inflammation as well as the contribution of lignan derivatives to the anti - inflammatory activity of this herbal product .
the actions of the pure compounds isolated on multiple targets may explain the promising anti - inflammatory activity of the ch2cl2-soluble extract of k. lappacea roots . considering its potency ( higher than indomethacin ) , this extract may be able to be developed as a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of topical inflammatory processes , after suitable standardization and clinical safety evaluations .
taken together it has been shown that several of the lignan derivatives investigated possess a pronounced topical anti - inflammatory activity in vivo , comparable to that of indomethacin , and about 7 times less compared to hydrocortisone . an attempt to clarify the mode of action of the pure compounds revealed two relevant pathways , namely , the nf-b - pathway , where almost all investigated compounds showed activity , and selected enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade , which were influenced by only some of the benzofuran derivatives .
the elucidation of the responsible target(s ) within the nf-b pathway as well as the possible impact on other inflammatory cascades is part of an ongoing study .
