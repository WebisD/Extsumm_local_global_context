finally , unenhanced mr imaging was reported to be necessary in order to decrease the number of false - positive findings attributed to vascular structures . however , " biphasic " unenhanced and ferumoxides - enhanced mr imaging is time consuming and such unenhanced imaging is thus not obtained ( 36 ) . without unenhanced imaging , we recorded few false - positive findings . in conclusion , our results suggest that t2 * -weighted fmpgr , t2 * -weighted fmpspgr , and proton density fse sequences after intravenous ferumoxides administration provide higher diagnostic accuracy than the other four sequences ( t2-weighted ssfse , t2 * -weighted grass , t2-weighted fse , and proton density ssfse ) , and show higher cnrs , fewer image artifacts and better lesion conspicuity . for the detection of hccs at ferumoxides
third , it was only in the detection of hccs that optimal pulse sequences for ferumoxides - enhanced mr imaging were evaluated : optimal sequences for the characterization of focal hepatic lesions could not be determined .
hccs were statistically significantly clearer at proton density and t2-weighted fse , and at all three types of gradient - echo imaging than at the two ssfse sequences ( fig .
