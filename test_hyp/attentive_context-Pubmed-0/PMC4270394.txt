we examine how well 
 short - term measures ( 1 , 2 , and 7 day mean measurements ) of stove use 
 predict study means , with the goal of optimizing sampling times and 
 strategies for monitoring household energy interventions .
to 
 fully understand and accurately characterize adoption of an intervention 
 and changes in traditional habits ; and ( 3 ) that a combination of more 
 transformative , aspirational interventions  that can fully displace 
 the traditional stove  and education and training , to sway participants 
 away from the old stove , will be required to fully realize benefits .
we believe 
 the data set described in this paper is the longest and deepest data 
 set of measured stove usage generated to date , spanning over 15 months 
 of monitoring at 10 min intervals on both intervention and primary 
 traditional stoves in 200 homes ( 21 million data points ) . 
 measuring multiple stoves required creation of new metrics to characterize 
 shifts in usage patterns over time .
the data set consists 
 of one of the largest and longest objective measurement campaigns 
 of stove usage to date . by deploying stove use sensors for over a 
 year , we were able to track and report for the first time the changes 
 in usage of an advanced cookstove intervention and the primary traditional 
 stove over time .
