therefore , in this study we aimed to investigate polysomnographic sleep and respiratory parameters in patients with nsp as well as changes in those parameters after treatment of nsp . to the best of our knowledge ,
our preliminary results indicated that nsp did not cause any deterioration in objective sleep parameters as determined by psg , other than a decrease in rem sleep duration and an increase in supine ahi .
although median supine ahi decreased to 1.60 ( 28.30 ) after closure of the perforation in the group with a perforation > 66 mm , the difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.130 ) .
a number of studies investigated the presence of nasal septal deviation and the impact of its surgical correction on sleep quality and respiratory parameters in patients with obstructive sleep apnea , showing that nasal surgery alone was not effective in restoring a normal sleep architecture or in treatment of obstructive sleep apnea   .
however , the median baseline supine ahi was 10.10 ( 34.15 ) in the group with a perforation > 66 mm , and it was 8.55 ( 51.43 ) in the group with a perforation size 66 mm .
further studies performed on a larger patient cohort may shed light on the effects of nsp and its treatment on sleep .
