we therefore performed a retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent bulbar end - to - end anastomosis to report our experience with the surgery and to assess the factors affecting surgical outcome .
we reviewed the medical charts of 33 patients who underwent excision and end - to - end anastomosis for bulbar urethral strictures by a single surgeon and who completed at least 6 months of follow - up .
excision and end - to - end anastomosis for short , bulbar urethral stricture has an acceptable success rate of 87.9% with minor complications .
the urethral catheter was removed a mean of 16.5 days ( range , 13 to 24 days ) postoperatively . at a mean follow - up of 42.6 months ( range , 8 to 96 months ) , 29 of the 33 patients ( 87.9% ) had no evidence of recurrent stricture .
all recurrences occurred in the patients with nontraumatic causes ( iatrogenic in three , infection in one patient ) .
strictures recurred in four patients ( 12.1% ) at a mean follow - up of 3.5 months ( range , 2.5 to 4.7 months ) .
although all patients had excellent outcomes , with good urinary stream and not requiring any intervention after the reoperation , further follow - up is needed because of the short follow - up time ( range , 4 to 7 months ) .
