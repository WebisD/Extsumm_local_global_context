we report our findings in a pcd patient who was examined by high - resolution imaging of the central and peripheral cone photoreceptors with high - resolution oct and ao analyses .
our findings indicate that the pcd diagnosed by full - field ergs and perimetry is due to a reduction in the density of parafoveal and peripheral cones .
a dark area in the ao fundus images was reported to be caused by disruptions of the interdigitation zone ( iz ; formerly called the cone outer segment tips line ) in the spectral - domain optical coherence tomographic ( sd - oct ) images   .
because we have investigated only one patient , our study does not allow us to draw strong conclusions on why the degeneration is greater in the parafoveal cone photoreceptors with relative sparing of the central cone photoreceptors . to identify the molecular pathogenesis of pcd may clarify the mechanisms of foveal sparing of cone degeneration .
genetically , the patient s parents were unaffected and non - consanguineous which suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance .
the adaptive optics ( ao ) fundus camera can obtain images with a transverse resolution of < 2  m which makes it possible to resolve individual cone photoreceptors and other retinal structures in living human eyes   .
