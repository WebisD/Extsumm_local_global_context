extensive past infection of a variety of evs in apes and owms should lead to a reappraisal of the host range of what have been considered to be primarily human viruses and a potential source for the periodic emergence of new ev types into immunologically naive human populations .
serologic testing of nonhuman primate samples provided unequivocal evidence of exposure to all 3 serotypes .
although primate sampling was restricted to animals held in sanctuaries under veterinary supervision and infections may have been acquired in captivity from human or dietary sources , epidemiologic observations support the hypothesis that ev infections may also be acquired in the wild .
. however , the global outbreak of ev - d70 that originally centered on a cluster of human infections in central africa ( 14,15 ) provides a potential example of this occurrence .
to estimate population exposure of apes and owm species in africa to evs , we conducted a seroepidemiologic study of serotype - specific neutralizing antibodies against 3 ev types .
overall , our serologic survey data and previous fecal sampling data ( 3 ) provide evidence for extensive circulation of evs between primates and existence of human and owm reservoirs of infection that may spill over into ape populations too small to maintain indigenous ev variants . whether owms or apes represent a potential source of new evs in humans ( that may become pandemic in the absence of prior population exposure ) is uncertain
