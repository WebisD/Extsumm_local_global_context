therefore , we conclude that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is technically feasible , safe , and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy .
the purpose of this study is to examine our experience with open and laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in a population of infants with a history of previous neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux .
our results suggest that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) is at least as safe and effective as open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) in the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in a population of infants with a history of a neonatal laparotomy .
two infants in the lnf group already had gastrostomy tubes in place at the time of fundoplication , both of which were placed by the open method , one on the first day ( duodenal atresia ) and the other at one month of age ( jejunal atresia ) .
what may appear as a large difference in days of life at initial operation may be accounted for by the fact that 2 patients in the onf group had initial laparotomies at ages 51 days ( ileostomy/ mucus fistula for perforated nec in ex-25 week gestation infant ) and 90 days ( duodenoduodenostomy for duodenal atresia in 1.5-kg infant born at 800 g ) .
