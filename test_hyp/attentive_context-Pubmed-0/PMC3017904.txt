, the serial analysis of gene expression ( sage ) method was used to identify the early transcriptional changes induced by a low - fat ( lf ) or high - fat ( hf ) meal in the gastric mucosa .
sage , indeed , is a powerful and reliable sequencing - based technique   which allows to detect the regulation of novel transcripts as well as characterized genes , as we have already shown in a number of previous studies   .
the principal aim was to identify new signals specifically induced by hf intake in the short term of meal consumption . given the weakest satiation power of hf compared to lf foods , these signals may represent potential pharmacological targets for the early modulation of appetite / satiety balance .   in this study , both lf and hf regulated gene expression in gastric mucosa , and 17 known genes
the present study was the first to analyze the global transcriptional changes acutely induced in mouse stomach mucosa by feeding and , in particular , by different nutritional stimuli .
the latter point may explain the delayed and prolonged downregulation of digestive transcripts in the hf group , which also suggests that the reinduction of transcription observed at lf 3  h may have started later in the hf - fed mice . interestingly , though all the mice had ad libitum access to food , feeding behavior and total ingestion were dissimilar between lf and hf groups ( figures 1 and 2 ) , possibly explaining the differences in the transcriptional regulation of digestive enzymes .
