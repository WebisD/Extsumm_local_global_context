the purpose of the present study is to compare manual and automated instrumentation techniques for the removal of root canal filling material as well as to compare the efficiency among automated systems , of which ni - ti system is especially designed for endodontic re - treatment procedures .
mean and standard deviation of the three study groups t - test and analysis of variance test with two - tailed p value among the three study groups when the results were analyzed it was noted that there was a significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) between the effectiveness of manual method using hedstrom files to that of using rotary files . both the rotary systems were effective in removing the root canal filling material from the canal walls .
no significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) was observed between protaper retreatment to that of the race file system in removing gutta - percha from the canal walls . when the cervical , middle , and apical thirds were analyzed separately ,
the samples were stored at 37c for 30 days , and then , they were divided into three groups of 10 samples each , and each group was treated using a different technique .
