the present study revealed an increase in oef in diabetic akita mice at both 12 and 24 weeks of age , due to reductions in po2v and o2v . furthermore , there was a lack of normal increase in do2 with age in diabetic mice , driven by failure of f to increase with age in the diabetic group .
in another study , the oef values were 0.46 and 0.51 in the diabetic rats at 4 and 6 weeks of diabetes , respectively , and 0.55 in the nondiabetic rats .
, our finding of normal inner retinal oxygen metabolism in diabetic akita mice indicates that elevation of the oxygen extraction fraction adequately compensates for reduced oxygen delivery and prevents oxidative metabolism from being limited by hypoxia .
retinal arterial ( po2a ) and venous ( po2v ) oxygen tension , and arterial ( o2a ) and venous ( o2v ) oxygen content , and arteriovenous oxygen content difference ( o2a - v ) of nondiabetic and diabetic ( akita ) mice at 12 and 24 weeks of age ( mean  sd ) as expected , dv was larger than da in both nondiabetic and diabetic mice ( p < 0.001 ) .
