the cort - mda method for determining the genomic sequences of na - type prrsv isolates had 
 several advantages in comparison with other sequencing methods .
the mutated locations and nucleotides , including position 13,850 , were 
 identical between those obtained by the cort - mda method and rt - pcr ( data not shown ) , 
 demonstrating the accuracy of the sequence by the cort - mda method and its potential 
 application to detecting ongoing mutations in the viral genome .
the cort - mda method requires 
 far fewer oligonucleotide primers for amplification and sequencing of the prrsv genomes . 

development of the cort - mda - based sequencing 
 method for eu - type strains will be beneficial for dissecting prrs outbreaks , because na- and 
 eu - type strains cause analogous clinical signs   and 
 can be epidemic simultaneously in the same location .
regardless of the type or cluster to 
 which the strain belongs , cort - mda  based methodology will facilitate rapid identification of 
 the prevailing prrsv isolate on an affected farm .
most importantly , the cort - mda method is robust and versatile regardless of the genetic 
 background of the na - type prrsv to be sequenced .
