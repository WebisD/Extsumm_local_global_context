it has been reported that liposomes can serve as carriers for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic drugs ( or agents ) targeted to the lymphatic system.1922 in our study , we used low - cost soybean lecithin as the lipid membrane when preparing the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites for sln mapping .
the slns embedded in deep tissues could be observed directly through near infrared fluorescence without the need for exposure of the slns to air .
no or low toxicity was detected after incubation of cells with chlorophyll for 3 days , whether alone or encapsulated in liposomes . although the mouse axillary slns can be observed to fluoresce rapidly after injection of either chlorophyll or liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites , the sln of the mouse injected with liposome - coated chlorophyll emitted brighter fluorescence than that of the mouse injected with chlorophyll alone .
in summary , chlorophyll extracted from the leaves of c. salicifolius was encapsulated into liposomes and used for the first time in sln mapping . due to the fact that the lipophilic chlorophyll can be well dispersed in liposomes ,
for example , when the concentrations of chlorophyll were 46.2 , 23.1 , and 11.6 g / ml , the fluorescent intensities of liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites were 22.2 , 20.8 , and 25.0 times higher , respectively , than those of the chlorophyll alone ( figure 2b ) .
