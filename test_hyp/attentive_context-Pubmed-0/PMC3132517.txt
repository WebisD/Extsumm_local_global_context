these compounds consist of four rings , two of which ( a / b ) form a sofa / chair system of trans quinolizidine , the second trans system ( c / d ) form a boat / chair conformations . on the basis of the analysis of the fragmentation processes of 17 in the fab conditions we wished to establish whether it would be possible to distinguish the positional isomers ( 13 ; 4,5 ; 6,7 ) ( figure 1 ) .
( 9 ) the differences in the relative abundances of ions a , c , and d in the fab mass spectra of 6 and 7 allow differentiation of these positional isomers .
identification and structural characterisation of isomeric bis - quinolizidine alkaloids is an important problem in their analysis .
mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for unambiguous determination of the structure of these compounds . in the literature that is no information about the fab mass fragmentation of bis - quinolizidine alkaloids .  
( 7 ) the differences in relative abundances of even - electron ions a and d ( table 1 ) in the fab mass spectra of 1 , 2 , and 3 and the presence of even - electron ion b [ m+h - co ] in the fab mass spectrum of 3 allow differentiation of positional isomers 1 , 2 , and 3 .
