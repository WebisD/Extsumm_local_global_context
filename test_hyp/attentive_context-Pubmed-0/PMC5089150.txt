the amount of albumin given directly correlated with the amount of fluid removed with 80.76 , 68.26 , and 60.0 g being infused on day 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , correlating to 12
serum creatinine declined statistically from 1.37 on day 1 to 1.21 on day 3 ( p<0.05 ) .
the mean weight on day 1 was 86.5 kg ( range : 75.997.0 kg ) , and on day 3 , it was 77.8 kg ( range : 66.888.8 kg ) .
this technique when used for less than 72 h and with albumin infusion can be a safe and effective means to manage patients in the hospital with large - volume tense ascites .
continuous paracentesis with an indwelling peritoneal catheter represents an important modality in the evacuation of ascites in selected patients .
the mean ascitic fluid removed on day 1 , 2 , and 3 was 6.60 , 5.72 , and 4.21 l respectively .
at this institution , a retrospective review was performed and 36 consecutive patients were identified with decompensated cirrhosis with refractory or large - volume ascites where indwelling peritoneal catheter placement was utilized . each patient had biopsy - proven cirrhosis , and an etiology was determined for each patient .
