systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) , intra - arterial thrombolytic therapy , and mechanical revascularization are therapeutic options in acute ischemic stroke ( ais ) in adults   . published experience in ais in childhood
a previously healthy 14-year - old boy was admitted with acute onset of severe left hemiparesis with a national institute of health stroke scale ( nihss ) score of 12 .
differences in the fibrinolytic system and the different etiology of ais in childhood may limit a simple extrapolation of the adult guidelines for systemic thrombolytic therapy .
acute multimodal imaging with mra , ct angiography , or angiography to clarify the etiology of ais might help to select the most appropriate treatment modality .
in contrast , a review of 17 cases published in the literature , which were treated with systemic thrombolytic therapy or intra - arterial revascularization ,   probably reflects a publication bias towards positive results with good outcome and low mortality .
treatment of ais in childhood without being part of a randomized controlled trial needs a careful individual approach .
the history of a potential trauma and thrombus formation in the distal ica made an intima dissection most likely , but could not be confirmed on angiography or mri after successful mechanical revascularization .
