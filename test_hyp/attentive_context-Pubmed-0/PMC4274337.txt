prespecified analyses were used to assess the impact of paroxetine 7.5 mg on the number of nighttime awakenings attributed to vms , sleep - onset latency , sleep duration , and sleep scores ( hfrdis and gcs ) .
although the overall reduction in nighttime awakenings is moderate , it has been sustained through 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with paroxetine 7.5 mg and may represent a meaningful magnitude of improvement for some women with symptoms attributed to vms .
improvements in nighttime awakenings and sleep duration occur without increased sedation , reduced sleep - onset latency , or increased sleep - related aes , suggesting that , in these studies , paroxetine 7.5 mg has a selective therapeutic effect on sleep parameters related to vms .
( pooled data ) , the reduction from baseline in nighttime awakenings attributed to vms was 39% ( from 3.56 to 2.17 ) in the paroxetine 7.5 mg treatment arm compared with 28% ( from 3.64 to 2.63 ) in the placebo arm ( p = 0.0049 ) . on week 12
3a ) were reduced from baseline to a significantly greater extent in the paroxetine 7.5 mg arm than in the placebo arm on week 4 ( pooled data : paroxetine 7.5 mg , 32% ; placebo , 20% ; p = 0.0068 ) , but not on week 12 ( pooled data : paroxetine 7.5 mg , 42% ; placebo , 35% ; p = 0.0663 ) or on week 24 ( 24-wk study : paroxetine 7.5 mg , 51% ; placebo , 38% ; p = 0.2405 ) .
