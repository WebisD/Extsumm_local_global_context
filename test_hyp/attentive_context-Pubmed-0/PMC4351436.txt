the main objective of the present study was to find out whether there is a significant difference in fasting serum levels of agrp peptide between patients with schizophrenia on clozapine monotherapy and age- and sex - matched healthy controls .
additionally , there were positive correlations with lean body mass ( r  = 0.38 and 0.49 in the whole study group and clozapine group , respectively ) , body water ( which amount is negatively correlated with the amount of body fat : r  = 0.96 , p  <  0.001 ) ( r  = 0.34 and 0.49 in the whole study group and clozapine group , respectively ) and basal metabolic rate ( r  = 0.42 both in the clozapine group and control group ) , also being in line with the above - mentioned mechanism . in animal studies
on the other hand , we have found negative correlations between agrp levels and total body fat ( r  = 0.34 and  0.48 in the whole study group and clozapine group , respectively ) .
biochemical and anthropometric measurements were combined with body composition determined using bioelectric impedance analysis ( bia ) , which provides accurate measurements of body fat , lean mass and body water ( bosy - westphal et al .
