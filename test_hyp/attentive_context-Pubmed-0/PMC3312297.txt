we can begin to understand the atrophy processes associated with aging and the possibility of intervening in these processes of loss of muscle mass and strength , as we age .
this and its receptor gene have been studied in the nematode worm c. elegans    as it is involved in determining the life span of the worm by suppressing cell death ( apoptosis ) .
the information in this paper concentrates on that acquired over the last decade on changes at the cellular and molecular levels in aging muscle tissue as present day molecular genetics and proteomics methods have provided us with tools for studying the age - related muscle growth , adaptation , and repair .
sarcopenia is the term that is often used to describe the syndrome of age - related muscle loss which is somewhat unfortunate as this implies that it is a disease rather than an attenuation of processes that develop and maintain muscle in young healthy people
a group of russian scientists   are producing a mgf peptide in this way and using it for bona fide reasons that include alcoholic myopathy and muscle atrophy resulting from space travel .
ancient man would have sustained muscle injuries during hunting and tribal confrontations , and , from a darwinian viewpoint , natural selection would have resulted in generations of offspring with strong and adaptable musculature ; this includes rapid and effective tissue repair as this was also a requisite for survival and the continuation of the species .
