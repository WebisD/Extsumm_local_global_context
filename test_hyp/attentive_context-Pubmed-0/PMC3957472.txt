somitogenesis is , therefore , seen as a one - dimensional process ( along the anterior - posterior axis of the presomitic mesoderm ) and an important step in the model validation process can be to include a second spatial dimension and investigate whether the model is still capable of forming somites , as was done in . using fractional powers of the diffusion operator , we establish results about the existence and uniqueness of solutions and their positivity and boundedness in spaces of uniformly continuous functions .
we also look at solutions in l spaces and show that under suitable conditions the non - zero uniform state is asymptotically stable in l and that under more stringent conditions all solutions converge to this uniform state .
the purpose of the present paper is to formulate and analyse an extension of equation ( 1 ) to the case of n spatial dimensions , considering only cell - cell adhesion . again letting p(x , t )
another important reason for considering equations of the form ( 2 ) in higher space dimensions is that the inclusion of another space dimension can be an important test of the stability and robustness of a one - dimensional pattern , and therefore of the plausibility of a type of mathematical model in a situation where many details are unknown .
