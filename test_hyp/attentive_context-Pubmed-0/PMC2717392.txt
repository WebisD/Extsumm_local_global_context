with advances in technology ( particularly next - generation sequencing ) and growing enthusiasm for funding large - scale gene discovery efforts , hypotheses about the nature of this so - called ' genetic dark matter '   have a direct bearing on research strategies .
genome - wide association ( gwa ) analysis has provided the first effective strategy to allow a systematic dissection of the genetic basis of common , complex , multifactorial traits .
although for many of these we remain some distance from a complete enumeration of causal mechanisms , there have already been substantial advances in understanding of disease - the role of autophagy in inflammatory bowel disease   and cell adhesion in autism , for instance . however , for most common traits the proportion of the overall phenotypic variance explained remains small , limiting the extent to which prediction of individual disease risk is possible .
if so , then the sum total of genetic variance should largely be explicable in terms of the main effects of all the risk alleles of various types ( single nucleotide polymorphisms , indels , copy number variants ( cnvs ) and inversions ) , allele frequencies ( rare , low - frequency and common ) and effect sizes .
