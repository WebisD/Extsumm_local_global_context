the fidea tool was developed through a number of iterations with our collaborating experimental groups , and we believe that the resulting system is sufficiently easy to use and at the same time complete and flexible to be useful in the functional analysis of differential expression experiments .
the aforementioned considerations prompted us to provide experimentalists with a more user - friendly tool for analyzing their data from a functional point of view .
two of the aforementioned servers , babelomics and genecodis 3 , give the possibility of performing the analysis in parallel on two different lists of genes , for example , upregulated and downregulated ones or deregulated in different experiments , but the burden of comparing the results is still left to the user .
the main features of the tool that make it different from what is already available are the possibility of directly processing the results of the differential expression analysis , of interactively modifying the p - value and fold change thresholds used for selecting the genes , of analyzing up- and downregulated genes separately or together and to directly analyze and compare lists of genes obtained from more than one comparisons .
, we plan to include the possibility for the user to upload newly sequenced and annotated genomes and to link to information from public data such as , for example , expression levels of the genes of interest in different tissues or disease states .
