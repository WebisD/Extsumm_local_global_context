the salutary effects of these drugs are related , most likely , to their distinct immunomodulatory properties although eradication of persistent airway infection with chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with asthma may also play a role .
low - dose , long - term 14- and 15-membered ring macrolide antibiotic therapy represents a promising addition to our anti - asthma drug armamentarium .
there are three distinct components of reduction in airway caliber : secretions , smooth muscle contraction and airway wall thickening . while pathogenetic changes that bring about airway narrowing may be heterogeneous , it is generally accepted that inflammatory cell infiltration with secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines plays a major role in pathogenesis of asthma .
the precise relationship of acute inflammatory cascade to airway remodeling and its modification by host and environmental factors are under investigation .
neutrophilic inflammation becomes more pronounced and is related to airflow obstruction particularly in the airways of chronic asthmatics .
one possible explanation for the efficacy of low - dose , long - term macrolide antibiotics therapy in patients with asthma is the putative role played by persistent airway infections in its pathogenesis , particularly chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections .
