245 patients in the icu underwent bedside pdt with a ciaglia blue rhino percutaneous tracheostomy set ( cook medical , bloomington , in , usa ) due to prolonged endotracheal tube insertion .
our results show that pdt with the ciaglia blue rhino technique can be safely performed without a bronchoscope and blunt dissection .
this simplified technique is a relatively safe procedure that can be especially useful in situations of limited equipment and medical personnel .
this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital ( 2014 - 09 - 037 ) . between november 2011 and october 2014 ,
pdt was not performed in patients aged under 18 years , those with any pulsation palpated over the tracheostomy site , patients with a history of surgery or radiotherapy in the cervical region , and those with coagulopathy ( increased prothrombin time , inr > 2 ) .
although a fob was used to determine the proper tube depth in 55 patients , the needle and guidewire entered the murphy eye of the tube twice .
a retrospective study comparing early and late complications of pdt , with or without fob assistance , using the ciaglia blue rhino kit in 243 patients found no between group differences in early and late complications , but one patient experienced cardiac arrest during the use of a fob due to loss of airway . in this study , only 3 patients experienced bleeding after pdt , with all 3 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and having an abnormal coagulation status .
