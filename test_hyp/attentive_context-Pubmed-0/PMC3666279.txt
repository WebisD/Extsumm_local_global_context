series 1 quantified fa uptake and metabolic fate in vivo at the individual tissue level based on the simultaneous combined use of [ 9,10-h]-(r)-2-bromopalmitate ( h - r - brp ) and [ u - c]-palmitate ( c - p ) . the h - r - brp tracer is used to estimate local fa ( oxidative + nonoxidative ) utilization while c - p is used to assess non - oxidative fa disposal into lipid stores . series 2
by contrast , non - oxidative disposal of fa in skeletal muscle was heavily influenced by availability and remarkably did not appear to be diminished by a contraction mediated increase in local oxidative metabolism .
we showed that in skeletal muscle , fatty acid uptake associated with contraction was channeled into oxidation .
thus , in the obese animals the flux of plasma fa into storage metabolism was substantially increased in liver , skeletal muscle , wat , and the heart compared to the corresponding fluxes in the lean animals ( tables 4 and 5 ) .
in summary , our assessments of in vivo fa fluxes demonstrate that the major factor responsible for non - adipose tissue lipid overload in the insulin resistant obese zucker rat is systemic fa oversupply .
