we report a case of cologastric stricture treated with resection and reconstruction of the anastomosis solely through an abdominal approach , which can offer less morbidity and mortality .
a 31-year - old male developed a caustic esophageal injury after ingestion of an alkaline solution when he was 2 years old .
endoscopic dilation is relatively safe and effective for the initial treatment of anastomotic strictures , but surgical management is indicated in refractory cases . when surgery is required , graft revision utilizing both a thoracotomy and laparotomy is common .
this surgical approach should be considered in patients with history of colonic interposition requiring reoperation for complications of the colonic graft .
caustic esophageal injury in infants is a devastating insult to the gastrointestinal tract and will often require major reconstructive surgery to replace the damaged esophagus . esophageal replacement with colonic
interposition has been utilized since dale and sherman performed the first retrosternal colonic interposition in 1955 . up to 80% of patients with colonic interposition
our patient did well with our transabdominal approach given the chronicity of his symptoms . in light of his clinical dilemma of continued non - operative versus operative intervention , his symptoms were relieved immediately .
