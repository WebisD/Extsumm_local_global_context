weaning from mechanical circulatory support after long controversy about the clinical relevance of unloading - promoted recovery from chronic heart failure ( hf ) and about the feasibility of elective weaning of patients from their ventricular assist device ( vad ) , taking into account the risk of early post - weaning hf recurrence , this topic has gained increasing interest over the past 10 years , especially after the publication of the first long - term weaning results in patients with chronic hf reversal after lvad implantation .
tissue doppler andstrain imaging data are useful for decision making especially if their stability after maximumremission is also considered .
cardio - pulmonary exercise testing ( with vad support and during off - pump trials ) provides information on inotropic reserve and can be useful for weaning decisions .
stable normal off - pump hemodynamics is necessary for weaning decision , but insufficiently predictive for long - term cardiac stability aftervad removal .
off - pump lvef  45% plus normal lvedd at rest are basic weaning requirements and their stability after maximum improvement over the next 2 to 4 weeks during and between additional off - pump tests is predictable for long - term post - explant patient outcome .
