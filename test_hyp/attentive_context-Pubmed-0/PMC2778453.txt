the aim of the present cross - sectional study was to analyse antibody 
 levels among hospital workers with known exposure to legionella and to determine the correlation between antibodies to legionella and self - reported symptoms 
 compatible with legionella infection . 

we found a higher prevalence of legionella antibodies ( 1 : 128 ) in the hospital staff with continuous exposure from 
 the water system than in blood donors being representative of the general 
 health population .
there were no consistent association between legionella antibodies and a symptom complex of at least three ( or 
 1.95 ; 95% ci 1.003.78 ) , four ( or 1.08 ; 95% ci 0.901.29 ) , or five ( or 0.99 ; 95% 
 ci 0.841.17 ) symptoms of the complex of influenza - like illness with adjustment 
 for age , gender , and current smoking .
the multiple regression model ( seropositives with titre   1 : 128 ) of 
 risk variables with p < .2 and gender , age , current smoking showed 
 significant increase in antibodies with showering elsewhere than home ( or 1.89 ; 
 95% ci 1.083.31 ) , air - conditioning in car ( or 1.99 ; 95% ci 1.153.35 ) , and decreasing 
 age ( or 0.97 ; 95% ci ( 0.940.99 ) .
