recently , the detection of cystic lesions in the pancreas has greatly increased because of the wide use of high - resolution diagnostic imaging techniques.1 in contrast to solid tumors which are usually ductal adenocarcinomas , which have a very poor prognosis , most cystic lesions of the pancreas are either benign or low - grade malignancies ; thus , it is relatively easy to perform curative resection for them.2 therefore , cystic and intraductal tumors of the pancreas consist of an essential category with a challenging differential diagnosis.3 pancreatic squamoid cyst is defined as a lesion with cyst - like dilated ducts that are lined by non - keratinized squamous epithelium , and it is a recently recognized type of cystic lesion of the pancreas.2 we herein present a case of a patient with a pancreatic squamoid cyst who underwent laparoscopic resection .
a 60-year - old woman who underwent abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) for a routine health check - up was found to have a 1.8-cm cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas .
cea is a very accurate tumor marker for diagnosing mucinous pancreatic cystic neoplasms , although the accuracy of this marker and the cut - off level vary among laboratories.9,10 in conclusion , squamoid cyst of the pancreas is a very rare disease , and it has been proposed only recently as a distinct pathologic lesion .
