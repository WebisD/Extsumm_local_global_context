the purpose of the present study was to further investigate global and regional effects of age and gender on bbb pgp function in a large group of healthy controls , as measured using ( r)-[c]verapamil and pet .
the volume of distribution of ( r)-[c]verapamil increases with age in several cortical brain regions , strongly suggesting a progressive decrease in bbb pgp function with age .
this is the first study to assess in vivo effects of gender and aging on human bbb pgp function in a large sample size with pet and ( r)-[c]verapamil .
for fbp reconstructed data , significant ( p  <  0.05 ) increases in ( r)-[c]verapamil vt were found in the elderly group compared with the young group for frontal , temporal , posterior and anterior cingulate , medial temporal lobe and cerebellar regions ( table  2 ) . for pvc osem reconstructed data ,
0.10.80    0.1**p  <  0.05 for young versus elderly aged group volume of distribution of ( r)-[c]verapamil in several brain regions for different age groups in case of fbp reconstructed data *
this study shows an 18 to 38  % increase in the volume of distribution of ( r)-[c]verapamil with normal aging in several brain regions , such as frontal , temporal , medial temporal and anterior and posterior cingulate regions .
