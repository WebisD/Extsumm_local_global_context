due to such continuous disease dynamics in response 
 to environmental changes , we plan in our future research to investigate the potential 
 role of rodent populations in the circulation of the parasite in the sinai , to study in 
 detail the coarse - resolution ecology and to study the biogeography of disease through 
 mapping exercises and site suitability analysis using efficient quantitative 
 techniques .
these environmental changes coincided with the increase in cl incidence 
 in sinai due to a change in the vector and rodent populations and consequently a change 
 in the disease dynamics in the area .
the mean annual 
 cases reported to the official public health centres in north sinai during 2006 - 2011 
 were 296.67 cases ( ministry of health of egypt , unpublished observations ) , with the 
 highest infection rate reported during 2008 - 2010 due to a change in environmental 
 conditions . toward the end of this period , the incidence of zcl caused by l. 
 major decreased after control efforts for both vectors and rodent reservoirs 
 by the egyptian ministry of health .
however , the results revealed no evidence for the presence of infection in most of the 
 sandflies collected ; for instance , the only species found infected with 
 leishmania promastigotes was p. papatasi , with an 
 infection rate close to 0.5% .
