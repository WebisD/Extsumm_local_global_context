the esr and crp were significantly higher in uc patients than in controls ( p < 0.001 ) , whereas the wbc was similar in both groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
the main findings of this study were as follows : ( 1 ) gfap was not detected in either the uc patients or controls , while the serum s100b levels were decreased markedly in the uc patients ; ( 2 ) there was no correlation between the serum s100b levels and the disease activity or duration in uc patients ; and ( 3 ) the serum s100b levels were similar in active and remission uc patients . similar to astrocytes in the cns ,
this study investigated whether these enteroglial markers could serve as noninvasive indicators of egc activation and the disease activity in patients with uc .
however , we found a significant decrease in the s100b serum levels in patients with uc compared with the controls ( p < 0.001 ; table 2 ; figure 1 ) .
no gfap was detected in the serum samples of either uc patients or controls ( p > 0.05 ; table 2 ) .
no correlation between the serum s100b levels and the disease activity or duration was observed ( p > 0.05 ) .
