the simplicity of both nanocage and cagescan combined with decreasing sequencing cost opens the possibility for a truly high - throughput library production of pooled , multiplexed libraries followed by parallel sequencing , with applications ranging from drug screening , biopsy analysis , and whole transcriptome association studies .
here we present nanocage and cagescan technologies , which provide a genome - wide profiling of tsss from small quantities of rna and link them to the anatomy of transcribed rnas .
so far , an unbiased analysis of the transcriptome and promoter usage from challenging samples such as biopsies , homogeneous population of ex vivo cell types or subcellular compartments has been hampered by the low quantity of rna and by the use of fixatives that are detrimental to rna integrity .
therefore , we expect nanocage to become the technique of choice for micro - dissected samples in experimental biology and molecular pathology .
analysis of the mammalian transcriptome and transcriptional network in ex vivo cells requires technologies that provide a comprehensive and unbiased view of the tissue - specific promotome ( the complete set of promoters ) from small amounts of rna and the intron - exon structure of the transcripts associated with different transcription start sites ( tsss ) , which are marked by a cap - site in most eukaryotic rna polymerase ii - derived rnas . among sequencing - based techniques to measure gene expression , tag - based methods are common .
