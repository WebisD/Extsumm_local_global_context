in this report , we describe a patient without previously known bone disease who presented with aggressive temporal bone invasion of unilateral vs.
a 51-year - old male presented with progressive hearing loss of last 4 years and dizziness of few months duration .
vestibular schwannoma ( vs ) usually arises within the internal auditory canal ( iac ) from either the superior or inferior vestibular nerve .
temporal bone destruction beyond the cortex of iac in vs is very rare , which cause facial nerve compressed and distorted severely . during operation
, it is very difficult to dissect and preserve the facial nerve because of uneven erosion of temporal bone .
the combined translabyrinthine with retrosigmoid suboccipital approach was used for the resection of the tumor . at the first time of surgery , we removed the tumor piece by piece within temporal area with translabyrinthine approach , but we could not find facial nerve with this approach .
the location of tumor in iac was closely related in erosion of iac , tumor that arise laterally along the course of eighth nerve could tend to cause varying degree of erosion before they extend into cerebellopontine angel ( cpa ) cistern4 ) .
