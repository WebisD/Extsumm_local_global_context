, we review the scientific evidence supporting the who - recommended antibiotics ciprofloxacin , ceftriaxone and pivmecillinam for the effective treatment of dysentery .
we systematically reviewed all literature published between 1 january 1990 and 31 january 2009 to identify the studies describing the efficacy of ciprofloxacin , ceftriaxone and pivmecillinam for the treatment of dysentery in children aged 5 years .
we applied the cherg rules for evidence review to the collective diarrhoea morbidity outcomes to estimate the effects of ciprofloxacin , ceftriaxone and pivmecillinam on eliminating severe morbidity due to diarrhoea in children with dysentery .
us fund for unicef from the bill & melinda gates foundation ( grant 43386 to  promote evidence - based decision making in designing maternal , neonatal and child health interventions in low- and middle - income countries ) .
