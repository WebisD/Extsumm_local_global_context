, 
 we have conducted an initial evaluation of ebola virus persistence 
 within wastewater to address uncertainty and inform ongoing risk assessments . 
 a current ebola virus outbreak strain from guinea ( makona - wpgc07 ) 

ebola virus titer was rapidly reduced ( approximately 
 99% ) within the first day of the test , consistent with an inability 
 to identify infectious ebola virus from the initial sample with 10 ebola virus tcid50 ml on day 
 1 .
the observed ebola virus inactivation in wastewater was 
 more rapid than that reported for human blood , which required 20 days 
 for a 90% inactivation , and results are 
 consistent with recent studies that identified viable ebola virus 
 to persist in infected macaque blood for > 8 days . in general , ebola virus was found to be less persistent 
 in wastewater than model enteric viruses . while the t90 for ebola virus in wastewater was found to be < 1 
 day , the t90 for hepatitis a is greater 
 than 17 days and the t90 for enteric adenovirus is 33 days ; however , the t90 for poliovirus 
 is 5 days , which is between the observed t90 values including or excluding the time zero 
 time point .
