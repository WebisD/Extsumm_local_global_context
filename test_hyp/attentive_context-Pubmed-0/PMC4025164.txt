since the highest tff1 levels in er - negative tumors of postmenopausal patients were similar across tumors of different histological grade ( 12.3 , 13.9 and 9.6 for histological grades i , ii and iii , respectively ) , we established 14 ng / mg as the cut - off value to discriminate between estrogen - dependent and estrogen - independent tff1 expression in breast cancer .
the last result may be expected , considering a statistically significant correlation between tff1 and either er or pr levels in analyzed samples of breast carcinoma ( r=0.295 , p<0.001 and r=0.254 , p<0.001 , respectively ) .
in addition , postmenopausal and pr status were found to affect dfi probabilities of tff1-positive patients with er - positive tumors of grade ii in such a way that : a ) among patients with positive pr status , premenopausal patients had significantly lower dfi probabilities in comparison to postmenopausal ones ( p=0.009 , figure 4 ) and b ) among postmenopausal patients , those with negative pr status had significantly lower dfi probabilities in comparison to those with positive pr status ( p=0.04 , figure 5 ) . by use of chi - squared test
