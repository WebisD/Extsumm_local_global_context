recent efforts to compare the basic reproductive rate ( total number of malaria cases derived from 1 infective case and distributed by mosquitoes in the absence of immunity ) for imported versus local malaria cases provide a more nuanced and stable metric for measuring malaria elimination ( 13 ) . because this region has a unique ecology and distinct mosquito species composition ,
technical appendix . detailed study methods and additional tables summarizing data on imported malaria cases , active fever surveillance , and entomologic investigations for study of transmission risk from imported plasmodium vivax malaria along the china
the vector s susceptibility to imported p. vivax infection indicates potential for p. vivax malaria to be sustained in this region .
three villages ( manduo , luoping , and tuofeng ; figure ) in tengchong county , located in the westernmost part of yunnan province , were selected for study because of their 20112013 malaria incidence , ecologic features related to malaria transmission ( i.e. , altitude and proportion of land used for rice cultivation ) , and housing and economic status .
we used robust entomologic and epidemiologic metrics to assess malaria elimination in a border region .
during 20112013 , a total of 24 p. vivax malaria cases were reported from the study villages to the chinese information system for disease control and prevention ; all were classified as imported ( technical appendix ) , as determined by patients travel history ( 3 ) .
