they also demonstrate a positive attitude 
 towards involvement of physiotherapists in the management of patients with obstetric and gynecologic 
 conditions .
however , in nigeria , there is 
 limited information concerning the attitudes of obstetricians and gynecologists towards the 
 involvement of physiotherapists in the management of patients with obstetric and gynecologic 
 conditions as well as factors affecting their utilization of these services .
obstetricians and gynecologists in south - western nigeria have a general knowledge of 
 physiotherapy services in obstetrics and gynecology .
physiotherapy posting during basic medical training and better interaction 
 between obstetricians , gynecologists , and physiotherapists in the form of seminars , workshops , and 
 grand rounds , could enhance knowledge and attitudes of obstetricians towards involvement of 
 physiotherapists in patient management .
the questionnaire was in three sections , ie , demographic 
 characteristics , attitude of obstetricians and gynecologists to the role of physiotherapists in 
 obstetrics and gynecology , and extent of utilization and factors affecting utilization of 
 physiotherapy services by obstetricians and gynecologists . the attitude and utilization
utilization of individual professional skills depends on cooperation between health team members 
 and the extent to which they value the knowledge of other team members in discharging their services 
 to the patient , who is the main focus of the team.3 
 therefore , there is a need for interdisciplinary cooperation between health care professionals , 
 including obstetricians , gynecologists , midwives , physiotherapists , medical laboratory scientists , 
 and social workers.4 ogbona reported that 
 physicians who trained in nigeria had a poor knowledge and awareness of the physiotherapy profession 
 compared with their counterparts who trained in the west.5 this limited knowledge may affect appropriate utilization of physiotherapy services by 
 doctors , and could have an adverse effect on overall health care delivery in the country . in 
 contrast , ikhizama3 observed an increase in 
 knowledge of physicians trained in nigeria about physiotherapy services compared with that reported 
 by stephenson.4 however , both ogbona and abayomi 
 observed that , despite the positive attitude of obstetricians in selected hospitals in ibadan 
 township and ogun state towards physiotherapists , utilization of physiotherapy services was 
 poor.5,6 several studies have been carried out to assess the awareness , knowledge , attitudes , and 
 utilization of physiotherapy services in various medical conditions.3,6,7 inclusion of physiotherapy services in obstetrics and 
 gynecology is pivotal to delivery of an optimal health care service .
