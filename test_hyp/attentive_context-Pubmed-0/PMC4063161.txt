additional goals were to assess function in the acl reconstructed knee , return to sports and level of sporting activity , patient satisfaction , identification of complications if any , and the factors or reasons in those who either stopped sports or showed a fall in their sporting levels .
we found that at 5-year followup , the subgroup of patients that had returned to preinjury level of sporting activity ( 45.8% ) had the best scores 
our study has limitations in the form of a short sample size and a high drop - out rate of followup at 5 years . a young , active population that undergoes this surgery has high relocation rates due to study and employment reasons .
this was in contrast to patients who showed a fall in their sporting levels because of painful and unstable knee ( 12.5% ) .
subjective assessment with particular attention to return to sports and at what level was given more attention than objective findings , type of graft used , fixation method used , instrumented testing of joint stability , and investigations like roentogram .  
the purpose of this study was to analyze the functional outcome in competitive level sports persons at 5 years after acl reconstruction .
