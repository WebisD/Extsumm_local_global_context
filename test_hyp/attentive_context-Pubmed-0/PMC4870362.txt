thus , the aim of this study is to analyse , with the means of fea , the influence of 5 custom rai designs on stress distribution of peri - implant bone and to evaluate the impact on microdisplacement for a specific patient case .
based on the results of this study and within the limitations of the applied methodology , it has been found that adding targeted press - fit geometry to the rai standard design , preferably fins or bulbs , will have a positive effect on stress distribution and lower concentration of bone stress and will provide a better primary stability for this patient case .
numerical results from the current study suggest that adding targeted press - fit design characteristics to the standard rai design will decrease the amount of maximum von mises stress in the surrounding peri - implant bone , subsequently leading to more favorable load behavior for this patient .
the following measurements were recorded : the von mises equivalent stress ( vm ) at the bone peri - implant interface as a quantity of stress level for the load transfer mechanism   , the tensile / maximum ( t ) and compressive / minimum ( c ) principal stresses as a criterion to evaluate the bone overloading   , and finally deformed contact separation ( micromotion in m ) as an indicator for initial implant stability   .
