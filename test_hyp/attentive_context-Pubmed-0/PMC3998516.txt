a new method for the in situ study of battery materials that allows 
 for the visualization of concentration gradients formed in electrodes 
 during discharge is introduced . a significant difference in the performance 
 of the material dependent on whether it is near the bulk electrolyte 
 or current collector is observed . at higher rates of discharge ( > 10 
 c ) the electrode material near the current collector changes at a 
 much slower rate compared with the material close to the bulk electrolyte 
 in cells containing a high concentration of lithium ion vacancies . 

it is believed that this effect is the major limitation in the rate 
 performance of electrodes in conventionally prepared batteries . in parallel
we observed a significant breakdown in crystallinity 
 of the lifepo4 during the electrochemical measurements . 

nevertheless , 
 modern synthesis techniques such as sol  gel and hydrothermal 
 routes mean that synthesis of materials on the nanometre scale is 
 routinely achieved which means that commonly the rate limiting step 
 in the discharge of the battery material even with intrinsically poor 
 electronic and ionic conductivities is the li ion transport through 
 the electrolyte .
it was shown that the breakdown is far more significant when the battery 
 is cycled at a range of different rates rather than for the same number 
 of cycles at either a high or low rate . ideally , to obtain the 
 maximum rate out of a battery material of 
 a given particle size and ionic and electronic conductivity we need 
 an electrolyte that can supply the ions at high rates . in some cases
