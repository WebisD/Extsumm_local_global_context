lhd is considered a frequent cause of ph.2,6 left atrial ( la ) size is considered a marker of lhd with preserved ejection fraction.710 we undertook this study to examine the role of computed tomography of the chest ( ct chest ) in evaluating la size as an indicator of pcwp in patients undergoing ph evaluation .
our hypothesis was that a la appearing large on the ct chest would be an indicator of elevated pcwp during a rhc in patients with normal ejection fraction ( ef ) ( > 40% ) and normal aortic and mitral valves .
the estimated la areas corrected for the chest wall length ( l  w / lcw ) were 0.78  0.19 cm and 1.65  0.26 cm ( p < 0.001 ) in groups i and ii , respectively ( table 2b ) .
la area and impression may have been influenced by the cardiac cycle at the time of the ct chest and intravascular volume status of the patient .
when the diagnostic cardiac catheterization is subsequently undertaken , many patients referred for evaluation and treatment of pah have an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( pcwp ) , suggesting left heart dysfunction ( lhd ) ( diagnostic group ii classification ) as a cause of ph.2,3 the distinction is important as the prognosis and therapy are different between these two disorders.4 the diagnosis of pah requires a normal pcwp , or a normal left ventricular end - diastolic pressure at the time of cardiac catheterization.5 elevated pcwp may be an indicator of lhd in patients with preserved ejection fraction .
