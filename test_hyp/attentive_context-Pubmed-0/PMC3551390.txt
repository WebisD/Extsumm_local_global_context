this work reports on a patient with metastatic tnbc enrolled in this phase ii study of nab - paclitaxel , bevacizumab , and gemcitabine who experienced a long - term complete remission lasting just under 2 years and a pfs from diagnosis of nearly 3 years .
this case study demonstrates the potential for triplet chemotherapy with nab - paclitaxel , bevacizumab , and gemcitabine to elicit prolonged responses , potentially prolong os , and improve quality of life for patients with metastatic tnbc .
triple - negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) is characterized by absence of expression of the estrogen ( er ) and progesterone receptors ( pr ) and no human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2)/neu gene amplification   . unlike hormone receptor - positive and her2-overexpressing breast cancers , tnbc is unresponsive to endocrine therapy and her2-targeted agents , respectively , thereby limiting available systemic treatment options to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy   .
patients with metastatic tnbc have a very poor prognosis . in a large analysis of 255 patients diagnosed with tnbc at the md anderson cancer center between 1985 and 2004 ,
a phase ii study examined the combination of nab - paclitaxel , bevacizumab , and gemcitabine as first - line therapy for patients with her2-negative metastatic breast cancer .
