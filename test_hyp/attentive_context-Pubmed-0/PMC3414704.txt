we will calibrate the different options for the geomean approach on basis of acute ec50 values for standard and additional arthropod test species and insecticides by comparing the racs thus obtained with results of micro-/mesocosm tests .
, we intend to evaluate the implication of the proposed new aquatic data requirement ( inclusion of acute tests with a. bahia and/or chironomus spp . ) for the tier-1 acute effect assessment for insecticides .
in addition , we also explore whether the macro - crustacean gammarus pulex is potentially a suitable standard test species for the risk assessment of insecticides since this species has been widely used in toxicity testing and is often used as focal species for developing ecotoxicological models ( e.g. galic et al .
a possible solution to overcome unnecessary higher - tier testing is to calculate the tier-1 rac for insecticides by applying an af of 100 to the geometric mean ec50 value ( see efsa 2005 ) of the available aquatic arthropod taxa in the core data set , if ( 1 ) sufficient read - across information for related compounds is available to underpin this approach and , ( 2 ) for the insecticide under evaluation the acute ec50 values for d. magna en chironomus differ less than an order of magnitude . alternatively , the default approach may be to apply the geomean approach separately for crustaceans and insects and to select the lowest value . in a future paper
