. it could be because of variations in root canal morphology and difficult access to additional canal systems.8 this case report presents a successful , non - surgical management of mandibular left second premolar with three roots and root canals and a first premolar with two roots using a cone beam computed tomography ( cbct ) .
the present case report emphasizes the need to understand , interpret , and manage a three rooted mandibular first premolar with three roots which has been successfully managed using cbct .
description of the mandibular first premolar is typically of a single - rooted tooth.3,4 two - rooted , three - rooted , and four - rooted varieties have also been reported , but are rare.5,6 the root frequently has developmental depressions or grooves on both the mesial and distal surfaces . according to slowey , the mandibular premolars may present the greater difficulty of all teeth for a successful endodontic treatment.7 a study at the university of washington in 1955 assessed the failure rate of non - surgical root canal therapy ( nsrct ) in all teeth .
numerous endodontic failures after a routine treatment and flare - ups during the course of nsrct are cited as evidence
