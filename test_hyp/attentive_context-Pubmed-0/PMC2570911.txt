since its introduction into the western hemisphere in 1981 , denv-4 has been associated with dengue fever and only sporadically associated with serious cases of dhf or dss ( 1 ) .
our study documents the detection of denv-4 in manaus , amazonas , and the first isolation of this serotype in brazil in 25 years .
a study in colombia found more dhf patients infected with denv-2 than with denv-3 or denv-4 ( 11 ) .
these findings reinforce the need for continual epidemiologic studies and use of classic and molecular approaches in the surveillance of emerging or reemerging diseases .
conversely , another study showed an association of denv-4 with an epidemic of dhf that occurred in mexico in 1984 ( 12 ) .
the 3 isolates reported in our study were from patients with no travel history , which indicates that denv-4 is present in manaus .
there are many host ( and perhaps viral ) factors in dengue infections that may lead to development of dhf . on the basis of the antibody - dependent enhancement hypothesis
detection of denv-4 in brazil co - circulating with other denv serotypes endemic to this country represents an increased risk for dhf or dss because many persons have been sensitized by previous dengue infections but are not protected against infection with denv-4 .
