the method 
 of tar capturing used in this study 
 has been previously reported .
the inactivation of the acyl - coa 
 synthetase encoding gene , enc16 , in the heterologous 
 host strain s. coelicolor m1146-pbb01 was done using 
 -red recombination with an apramycin - resistant marker ( aac(3)iv ) 
 as described previously .
the isolation 
 of high - quality genomic dna from salinispora was 
 performed according to standard procedures .
the capture vector , pcap01 , containing yeast arsh4/cen6 and trp1 
 marker , e. coli puc ori , streptomyces c31 integrase gene(int ) , its attachment site ( attp ) and origin 
 of dna transfer ( orit ) , aph(3)ii gene ( kan / neo resistance ) , 
 and two 1 kb regions flanking the gene cluster on either side was 
 used to capture and propagate the enterocin gene cluster .
the vector 
 pcap01 with the captured enc gene cluster from s. pacifica cnt-150 was named pbb01 .
the 
 data were subjected to the molecular networking workflow and analyzed 
 as described previously .
the plasmid pbb01 and its derivatives 
 were conjugated into s. lividans tk23 and s. coelicolor m1146 
 using a standard triparental mating method with e. coli et 12567/pbb01 and e. coli et 12567/pub307 . after 6 days of growth in ssm media , the cultures 
 were extracted with four volumes of etoac and concentrated in vacuo .
