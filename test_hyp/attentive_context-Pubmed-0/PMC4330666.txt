a 48-year - old man presented with marked proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , and renal dysfunction with positive results for myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) and anca .
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( anca)-associated glomerulonephritis ( gn ) is characterized by necrotizing and crescentic gn with paucity of immunoglobulin ( ig ) and complement deposition , which is also known as pauci - immune crescentic gn .
coexistence of mn with mpo - anca crescentic gn is very rare and should be managed aggressively .
renal biopsy revealed crescents and thick gbm with subepithelial spikes along with igg deposition on immunofluorescent staining .
after one - month follow - up , antibody level and renal function did not improve .
membranous nephropathy ( mn ) is characterized by the formation of subepithelial immune deposit with resultant changes in glomerular basement membrane ( gbm ) , most notably spike formation .
we report a rare case of mn with myeloperoxidase ( mpo)-anca - associated crescentic gn in a 48 year - old - man who was admitted to our institute .
a 48-year - old man presented with intermittent puffiness of face and edema of the feet for two months .
when patient presents as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with marked proteinuria , further investigations to rule out possibility of mn with anca associated crescentic gn should be performed and the patient should be managed aggressively .
