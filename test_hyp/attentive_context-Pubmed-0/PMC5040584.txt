we report a unique case of an open patellar fracture above a total knee arthroplasty , sustained by a 56-year - old female patient .
despite the poor outcome of operative management in patellar periprosthetic fracture , this approach should be considered for acute and post traumatic fractures in young patients with a good remaining bone stock .
literature analysis showed few articles about this complication , but no publication has described the management of open patella fracture around total knee arthroplasty .
orthopaedic surgeons should consider open reduction and internal fixation as a good management alternative for periprosthetic patellar fracture , in case of a post traumatic and acute fracture in young patients with a good bone stock .
although several previous studies report a high rate of failure and unpredictable results of open reduction for periprosthetic patellar fracture , this approach ( especially the internal fixation with a strong and dynamic construct ) should be considered in young patients with a good remaining bone stock , who sustained an open or a displaced fracture after a high energy trauma .
peri - prosthetic patella fracture is a very uncommon entity , and challenging to treat , especially the open ones , because of the high risk of infectious complications .
