an atherogenic lipid profile is a prequel to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases , and hence , its association with sh in general and calculation of aip , in particular , could provide avenues for early diagnosis and rigorous management of dyslipidemia in hypothyroidism .
* difference of the means of aip between eu and sh groups is statistically significant ( p = 0.002 , < 0.05 ) correlation between atherogenic index of plasma and thyroid stimulating hormone in subclinical hypothyroidism group .
therefore , this study was conducted to understand the association of sh with abnormalities in the serum lipid profile and aip in apparently healthy adult females .
the study also aims to find out whether any correlation exists between aip and serum tsh levels among sh cases .
abnormalities found in conventional lipid profile as well as in lipid ratios and aip imply sh to be a risk factor for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis .
it includes mean and standard deviations of tc , tg , hdl - c , and ldl - c of eu and sh groups . the differences between the means of tc , tg , and ldl - c were found to be statistically significant while that for hdl - c was found to be insignificant ( p = 0.712 ) .
