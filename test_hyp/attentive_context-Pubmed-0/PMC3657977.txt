we present a rare case of complex relation of ln and ian with second part of ma and discussed its clinical implications .
the described variations were found in left infratemporal fossa of a 65-year - old male cadaver during routine dissection .
knowledge of maxillary artery ( ma ) and its branches in the infratemporal region is of great importance in dental , oral , and maxillofacial surgeries .
literature is replete with variations in infratemporal region , in the form of communication between branches of mandibular nerve ( mn ) , entrapment of nerves by bony bridges , abnormal course and branching pattern of arteries .
this type of anatomical knowledge is essential in choosing the best approach to treat lesions in this area . as in the present case ,
knowledge of such arterial and nervous complex may be helpful in radical neck dissection and in dental procedures to avoid untoward complications .
the communicating branches between the ian and ln are well described in the literature and these communications have been identified as a possible explanation for the inefficient mandibular anesthesia and also suggested that it will affect the mobility of the nerves .
the infratemporal fossa is a complex region on the skull base that is affected by benign and malignant tumors .
