none of the hospital and infection prevention and control department setting characteristics were significant predictors of the differences between the ips and qds perceptions of either of the safety microclimates . however , the ip respondents ' that identified themselves as directors of the infection prevention and control department perceived more positive senior management engagement compared to ip nondirectors ( mean 21.8 , sd = 3.8 versus mean 20.5 , sd = 4.3 , p = 0.042 ) .   
the aims of this study were to ( 1 ) compare the perceptions of two aspects of patient safety climate between ips and qds in the same hospital , ( 2 ) identify setting and role characteristics associated with differences in perceptions of patient safety climates , and ( 3 ) identify setting characteristics that predict more positive perceptions of patient safety climates .  
additionally , ips ' perceptions were more positive than the qds on the senior management engagement composite score ( 21.4 versus 20.4 , p < 0.01 ) .
both surveys were conducted to obtain preliminary baseline data on different aspects related to the prevention of hai with the ultimate goal of evaluating the california healthcare - associated infection prevention initiative ( chaipi ) .
