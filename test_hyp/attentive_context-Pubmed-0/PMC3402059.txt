this is due to an age - related decline in pulmonary volumes , particularly in fev1 , which is observed even in healthy people with no history of exposure to noxious particles or gases.1619 proposed strategies for reducing the misclassification of airway obstruction include use of the lower limit of normal for fev1/fvc , calculated as the fifth percentile of the normal distribution in a healthy population,2022 or the use of different fev1/fvc thresholds for different age groups ( eg , 0.70 for subjects aged < 70 years , 0.65 for those aged 7080 years , and 0.60 for those aged > 80 years).19 on this basis , a group of colleagues involved in respiratory research and/or the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases recently wrote an open letter to members of the gold committee inviting them to change the method by which airway obstruction is defined and asking for retraction of the fixed ratio in favor of the lower limit of normal.1 the aim of the present study was to provide additional information for determination of the most appropriate spirometric criteria for confirming airway obstruction in the elderly , by describing lung function and calculating the lower limit of normal for fev1/fvc in healthy nonsmoking elderly subjects ( age > 65 years ) who participated in the italian multicenter sara ( acronym of salute respiratoria nellanziano , italian for  respiratory health in the elderly  ) study .
