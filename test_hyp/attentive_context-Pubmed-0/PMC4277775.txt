we have shown that an edta titration can be used to test for the presence 
 of co(ii ) and a p nmr experiment can be used for the 
 co(ii ) quantification ; these experiments are more definitive than h nmr spectroscopy for identifying paramagnetic co(ii ) impurities . 
 beyond co(ii ) as an impurity , the use of any co(ii ) complex should 
 be assessed as an authentic woc versus precursors for heterogeneous 
 catalysts such as co - oec owing to the proclivity of co(ii ) complexes 
 to undergo rapid ligand substitution .
we further emphasize the utility 
 of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry ( dems ) for clarifying 
 how anodic potentials affect the decomposition of glassy carbon electrodes , 
 which are commonly used in the study of wocs .
without purification 
 by silica chromatography , the co(iii ) oxo 
 cubanes can be contaminated with co(ii ) impurities , which are responsible 
 for the observed water oxidation activity reported for these molecules . 

we note that 
 water oxidation activity of a catalyst should not depend on whether 
 an anodic potential is supplied electrochemically or ( photo)chemically 
 for mechanisms involving outer sphere electron transfers . in instances 
 where homogeneous and heterogeneous o2 evolution experiments 
 do not concur , it is appropriate to consider whether other species 
 are responsible for catalytic activity . finally , when inspecting carbon - based 
 electrode surfaces for the deposition of heterogeneous catalysts , 
 care must be exercised in the choice of oxidizing potentials , as extreme 
 values can give rise to spurious current that is associated with co2 evolution and electrode degradation as established by dems .
