demographic data including mean age  ( years ) , duration of infertility  ( years ) , bmi  ( kg / m2 ) and aetiology of infertility are illustrated in table i. ovarian stimulation data including number of treatment days , total dose of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone , hormone serum levels , endometrial thickness , number of follicles and number of patients receiving only 5000 iu of human chorionic gonadotrophin is illustrated in table ii .
values are expressed as mean + standard deviation values are expressed as mean  +  standard deviation : rfsh  =  recombinant fsh ; hmg  = human menopausal gonadotropins ; hcg  =  human chorionic gonadotropin ; e2  =  estradiol values are expressed as mean + standard deviation three patients  ( 9% ) required an early placement of a pigtail catheter while 30 patients  ( 91% ) had late placement of the catheter  ( table iii ) .
