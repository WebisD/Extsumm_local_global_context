, we emphasize the importance of imaging diagnosis of focal adhesive arachnoiditis of the spinal cord and describe the surgical technique of microsurgical arachnoidolysis to mobilize the spinal cord and reconstruct the csf pathway .
two patients showed modest or minor improvement in neurological function ( cases 1 and 3 ) , while two patients ( cases 2 and 4 ) were unchanged , although the extent of the syringomyelia or myelomalacia was clearly decreased soon after surgery in all cases [ figure 4 ] .
between january 2008 and the present , four consecutive patients with symptomatic syringomyelia or myelomalacia caused by focal adhesive arachnoiditis underwent surgical treatment at the osaka city university hospital [ table 1 ] .
the four patients satisfied our inclusion criteria , i.e. , ( 1 ) medical history of spinal trauma , surgery , or infection ; ( 2 ) clear symptoms and objective neurological deficit ; and ( 3 ) clear mri visualization of syringomyelia or myelomalacia with the suggestion of focal adhesive arachnoiditis .
microsurgical dissection of the arachnoid adhesion , with decompression of the subarachnoid space , is another approach and may achieve better and more long - lasting outcomes in selected cases . a clear indication as well as surgical procedures that take into account the underlying pathophysiology are absolutely necessary . here
