section 4 describes the 
 training and test data used for our experiments and presents experimental 
 results that demonstrate that our three - phase method is effective for detecting 
 gene interactions .
, we show that our proposed method significantly 
 outperforms existing methods , and describe the contribution of each phase to 
 its performance .
the icml05 workshop on learning language in logic ( lll05 ) task provided a 
 small training dataset annotated with pos - tags and syntactic relations .
to improve recall without sacrificing precision , we propose a 
 three - phase method to detect gene interactions using syntactic relation 
 information , and apply it to a small training dataset lacking domain knowledge . 
 through experimentation
however , we 
 have insufficient biomolecular data annotated with linguistic information . in 
 2005 ,
to improve recall without sacrificing precision , this 
 paper proposes a three - phase method for the automatic detection of gene 
 interactions using syntactic relations .
thus , 
 many recent studies have sought to extract interaction information from 
 biomolecular text using natural language processing technology .
the proposed method does not require 
 domain knowledge . to improve recall , in the first phase , we construct syntactic 
 encapsulation categories of agent and target . in the second phase ,
