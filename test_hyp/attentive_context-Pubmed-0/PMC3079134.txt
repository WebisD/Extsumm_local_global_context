, we evaluated the feasibility of coronary intervention using the sheathless gc in patients with small ras .
the use of transradial coronary angiography and intervention ( tri ) is increasing because of its low rates of major vascular access - related complications and the potential for early mobilization.1)2 ) a large - bore guiding catheter ( gc ) with a large - bore introducer sheath is needed in patients with complex lesions , but they can not be used in patients with a small radial artery ( ra ) because they can cause forearm discomfort and ra spasm and occlusion,3 ) which are significant limitations to the transradial approach . to conquer this limitation , gc that does not require
patients who required primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) were excluded because preparation of a sheathless gc that is composed of two pieces ( a catheter and a central dilator ) requires more time than a conventional one - piece gc .
the use of a sheathless gc was feasible in almost clinical settings for patients with small ras regardless of complexity or severity of the lesion .
two of the successfully treated lesions required conversion to a conventional gc after insertion of the 6 fr .
