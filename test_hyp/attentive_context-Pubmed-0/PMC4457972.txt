a 64-year - old man presented with feces coming from the transurethral catheter 5 days after radical cystectomy and neobladder operation .
cte may be a useful , sensitive , effective , and non - invasive technique for the evaluation of enteroneovesical fistulas , leakage from the anastomose sides in postoperative cases , and other extraintestinal complications such as urinary tract obstruction or abscess formation .
we think that this case report could be useful for early and correct diagnosis of similar cases .
the aim of this case report is to show that cte can be a new and effective modality in detecting enteroneovesical fistula and to discuss the efficacy of cte in the detection and evaluation of enterovesical fistula referring to the literature . to the best of our knowledge ,
enterovesical fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the intestine ( 1 ) .
ct enterography ( cte ) is a new technique for evaluation of small bowels , surrounding structures , and the entire abdomen ( 2 - 4 ) .
enteroneovesical fistula is a rare condition that can be difficult to diagnose ( 1 ) .
we demonstrated the location of the leakage with only one technique by cte with no need of an invasive procedure .
