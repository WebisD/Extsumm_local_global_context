this study investigated the effect of the single - leg , lateral 
 oblique , decline squat exercise on sacroiliac ( si ) joint pain with knee pain .
a 39-year - old female had severe pain in the right medial buttock and right anterior knee . 

therefore , the single - leg , lateral oblique , decline squat exercise can be effective for 
 treating si joint pain with knee pain caused by an abnormal quadriceps angle in females .
on palpation of the right medial buttock and right knee , the initial vas scores of 7/10 and 
 6/10 decreased to 2/10 for both regions .
following the course of exercise , the anterior pelvic tilt angles were 8 and 10 on the 
 right and left sides , respectively , and were higher than the initial values ( 3.5 and 6.5 ) . 

on palpation of the right 
 medial buttock and right anterior patella , the visual analog scale ( vas ) scores were 7/10 
 and 6/10 , respectively .
this study assessed the anterior pelvic tilt angle and the response to 
 pain provocation tests before and after 4 weeks of performing the exercise .
the single - leg , lateral oblique , decline squat exercise is 
 performed with descent to 90 knee flexion , followed by ascent to the initial position at 
 the individual s natural speed .
