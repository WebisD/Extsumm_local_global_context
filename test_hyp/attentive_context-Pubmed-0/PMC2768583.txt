cardiac resynchronization therapy ( crt ) is an important device - based , non - pharmacological approach that has shown to improve the outcome in selected patients with chronic heart failure ( hf ) .
secondly , a brief overview on the effects of crt in af patients is presented , followed by some recommendations , based on current evidence , on the most adequate approach according to patient characteristics , emphasizing the extent of atrial arrhythmic [ atrial tachycardia ( at)/af ] burden .
atrial fibrillation and other atrial rhythm disturbances in patients with hf may have an important negative impact on the clinical benefit conveyed by crt , if these are not appropriately managed .
, avj ablation may represent a fundamental tool to achieve full crt delivery and , thus , confer marked improvements in global cardiac function , and , further , in survival .
careful overall evaluation is mandatory to define precisely the at / af burden in order to articulate tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies . on the basis of recent observational data , in patients presenting intermediate or elevated at / af burden
efforts should also be dedicated towards establishing tailored treatment approaches to adequately manage different atrial rhythm issues in hf patients treated with crt .
