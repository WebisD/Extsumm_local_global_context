cap : community - acquired pneumonia ; curb65 : confusion , urea > 7 mmol / l , respiratory rate  30/min , blood pressure < 90 mmhg systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure  60 mmhg , and age  65 years ; icu : intensive care unit ; smart - cop : systolic blood pressure , multilobar chest radiograph involvement , albumin , respiratory rate , tachycardia , confusion , oxygenation and arterial ph .
the past 15 years have seen major advances in our understanding of severity assessment in community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) .
several recent studies , including the study by renaud and colleagues , have challenged us to re - evaluate how we consider severe cap , a concept for which there is still no universally accepted definition . since the development of the pneumonia severity index in 1997 , severe cap has been considered in terms of a patient 's risk of 30-day mortality  determined by a combination of age , co - morbidities and physiological parameters measured on admission .
prognostic tools have been promoted to guide all major management decisions in cap , including admission to the critical care unit .
the hope is that future studies can identify physiological scoring systems or biomarkers that can achieve these goals and provide an effective adjunct to clinical judgement in the early management of cap .
