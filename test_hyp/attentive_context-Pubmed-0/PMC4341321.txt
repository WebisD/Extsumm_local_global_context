hereby , we describe a case of opipramol - induced mania in a patient with bipolar depression .
opipramol is an atypical anxiolytic and antidepressant drug which has been found to be effective in depressive disorder .
although it was developed by schindler and blattner in 1961 , its use was limited and recently it has regained popularity among psychiatrists all over for the treatment of somatoform and depressive disorders . structurally its nucleus is similar to that of tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the attached side chain is identical to that of perphenazine . although it is structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants , it does not inhibit the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin and is a sigma - receptor agonist , primarily at the sigma-1 receptor subtype , but also at the sigma-2 subtype with lower affinity .
a 39-yr - old male was brought to our opd with 4 weeks history of talking excessively even to unfamiliar people , being irritable to others , overspending , singing , dancing and reduced need for sleep .
the above - mentioned case of bipolar depression who developed treatment emergent manic switch due to opipramol while on concomitant treatment with lithium remitted by fourth week of opipramol discontinuation .
