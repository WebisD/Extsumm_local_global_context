the regimen was associated with 36% clinical benefit . in conclusion , combining oxaliplatin to bolus fluorouracil ( either in flox or 3-week regimens ) as a second line in gemcitabine pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed encouraging efficacy , acceptable toxicity , and some clinical benefit specially when palliation or good quality of life is a target keeping in mind the simplicity in administration , the no need for hospitalization , and the less financial load specially with flox .
forty - eight patients with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer pretreated with gemcitabine ( including gemcitabine resistance or gemcitabine pretreated ) in ain shams university hospitals were included along the period between october 2008 and september 2011 .
further studies with large number of patients investigating the efficacy and tolerability of such bolus regimens in gemcitabine - pretreated pancreatic cancer patients are warranted .
the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma currently recommend second - line chemotherapeutic treatment after gemcitabine failure in selected patients using , for example , single - agent capecitabine or a combination therapy of fluorouracil , leucovorin and oxaliplatin ( folfox- ) like regimen . to date
preclinical data suggested that the 5-fu plus oxaliplatin combination is more cytotoxic when 5-fu is given as a short exposure , which gives a rationale for exploring the toxicity and efficacy of such protocols in advanced pancreatic cancer . in the current study , we conducted a randomized trial to compare two protocols ; flox and the 3-weeek bolus protocol regarding toxicity , response rate , and time to progression as primary end points , then overall survival as secondary endpoints .
