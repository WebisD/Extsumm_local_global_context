slt was developed to selectively target pigmented trabecular meshwork ( tm ) cells without causing thermal or collateral damage to the nonpigmented cells or structures of the tm.1 clinical trials of slt have been encouraging , with reasonable response rates , effective intraocular pressure ( iop ) reduction and minimal side effects.25 comparable studies have shown slt to be as effective as argon laser trabeculoplasty ( alt),6 while histological investigations have demonstrated less damage to the ultrastructure of the tm.78 as a result of these studies , slt has been advocated as a treatment for the management of open - angle glaucoma ( oag ) with a role as a possible primary treatment.3 in the current study , we assess the iop lowering effect and the complications of slt in egyptian patients with primary open - angle glaucoma ( poag ) .
slt was also effective in reducing the number of medications used by patients which is an economic advantage in developing countries .
selective laser trabeculoplasty ( slt ) is a new and promising treatment that uses the 532-nm frequency - doubled q - switched neodymium : yytrium  aluminum  garnet laser .
there was a tendency toward and increase in iop during follow - up , with a mean iop reduction of 3.52 mmhg ( 18% from baseline ) at 18 months ( p= 0.001 ) .
