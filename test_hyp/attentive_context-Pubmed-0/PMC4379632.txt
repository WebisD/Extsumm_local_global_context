we report here a case series of seven children with acute leukemia , whose tls was managed by a single dose of rasburicase .
a retrospective analysis of case records of seven children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) and tls , admitted to our pediatric oncology unit of our hospital between the period 2011 and 2013 , was done to evaluate the effectiveness of single - dose rasburicase ( sdr ) in the management of tls .
from an economic point of view , especially in a developing country like india , the promising single low - dose approach of rasburicase administration achieved satisfactory results with a great reduction of cost per patient , which can result in better cost - effectiveness with no compromise in clinical efficacy .
all were managed with hyperhydration , anti - hypertensives , allopurinol , and a single dose of rasburicase at 0.15 mg / kg . the dose was rounded off to the nearest available concentration of vials due to the financial constraints .
four had pre - b cell ( common all ) antigen - positive all and the other three had t - cell all determined by flow cytometry .
