wild - type bacillus subtilis cells ( strain 168 ) were grown in terrific broth ( sigma ) .
though the pdms lattices were typically ~ 15 cavities across , to avoid boundary effects and to attain the pixel density necessary for piv we imaged a central subregion spanning 6  6 cavities for square lattices , 7  6 cavities for triangular lattices , and 7 cavities for linear lattices ( multiple of which were captured on a single slide ) .
cavity regions were identified in each movie by manually placing the centre and radius of the bottom left cavity , measuring vectors to its immediate neighbours , and repeatedly translating to generate the full grid .
fluorescence in supplementary video 3 was achieved by labelling the membranes of a cell subpopulation with fluorophore fm4 - 64 following the protocol of lushi et al.16 the suspension was injected into an identical triangular lattice as in the primary experiments and imaged at 5.6 f.p.s . on a spinning - disc confocal microscope through a 63 oil - immersion objective . for each frame of each movie , the bacterial suspension flow field u(x , y , t ) was measured by standard particle image velocimetry ( piv ) without time averaging , using a customized version of mpiv ( http://www.oceanwave.jp/softwares/mpiv/ ) .
