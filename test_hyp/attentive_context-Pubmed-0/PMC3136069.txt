in this case report , we describe a case of asherman 's syndrome treated with adult autologous stem cells for endometrial regeneration that resulted in conception after in vitro fertilization - embryo transfer ( ivf - et ) .
the basis of this case is that endometrium is a dynamic , cyclically regenerating tissue , a unique model of physiological angiogenesis in adults .
to the best of our knowledge , no case of asherman 's syndrome conceived after endometrial regeneration with adult autologous stem cells after failure of all other conventional modes of treatment has been reported in literature .
angiogenesis results either from sprouting of new vessels through recruitment of local endothelial cells from neighbouring blood vessels and/or by endothelial progenitor cells circulating in the peripheral blood after release from the bone marrow.  bone marrow stem cells also contribute to regeneration of the endometrium . on the basis of these facts ,
bone marrow aspiration is fairly safe procedure with the risk of bleeding or infection , which are extremely rare when done meticulously in the hands of the expert .
this therapy can be used as an alternative to surrogacy in females with severe asherman 's syndrome , though larger trials may be needed to establish this as proved line of treatment .
