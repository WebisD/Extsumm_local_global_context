, we describe a case of angiosarcoma in which complete remission was archived with low dose docetaxel and bisphosphonate after the standard treatment of angiosarcoma .
a 78-year - old woman consulted us with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic nodule on her scalp .
the combination of docetaxel with bisphosphonate was effective for mmp-9-expressing angiosarcoma and resulted in complete remission after the standard therapy for angiosarcoma .
however , there is no english report suggesting the expression of mmp-9 on human angiosarcoma of the skin . in this report
in our present case , we describe a case of mmp-9-expressing angiosarcoma treated with low - dose docetaxel and bisphosphonate . like paclitaxel
her nodule has been surgically resected at a private clinic 3 months before her visit .
inhibition of mmp-9 by bisphosphonate could be one of the optimal supportive therapies for the treatment of angiosarcoma by inhibiting tumor - induced angiogenesis and by the induction of anti - tumor immunity . in conclusion ,
two weeks after the resection , skin nodules had suddenly enlarged . on her first visit ,
considerable evidence has implicated matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) in the degradation of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) during the metastatic process .
