the mutation study in our population should involve these eight mutations to improve molecular diagnostics of the apc gene .
screening for these mutations permitted us to diagnose 19% of all families in our population but eight types of mutations constitute 43.5% of all our diagnosed families .
mutations of the apc gene , in most cases , are small deletions or insertions with the most frequent mutations , in the greater part of the described populations , being the aaaga deletion at codon 1309 and the acaaa deletion at codon 1061 .
the correlation between mutations of the apc gene and the occurrence of familial adenomatous polyposis was described in 1991   and since then , mutations of the apc gene have been investigated in research centres leading to identification of various mutation types .
molecular diagnostics of cancer predisposition is very important for the medical treatment of the patient and persons belonging to the high risk group .
the most frequent mutation , 39273931delaaaga , occurred in twenty - eight families ( 10% ) ; the second one was 31833187delacaaa , occurring in eight families ( 2.8% ) ; and the third most frequent mutation was 32023205deltcaa , detected in 5 families ( 1.7% ) . in our fap patients
