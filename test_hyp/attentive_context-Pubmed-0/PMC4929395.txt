in conclusion , regular - dose imatinib was an effective and safe treatment in a patient with gist undergoing dialysis .
we also present a literature review of the efficacy and safety of imatinib treatment in patients with gist undergoing dialysis .
we report a patient with duodenal gist undergoing dialysis who was treated with regular - dose imatinib and remained stable with no adverse events for 4 months .
imatinib is an effective and safe therapy for kit - positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist )   .
in a 75-year - old japanese man , a large duodenal tumor was identified on computed tomography ( ct ) in 2008 and was suspected as gist on endoscopic ultrasonography . however , the patient refused further investigation and underwent a follow - up visit .
chemotherapy in dialysis patients is challenging because excretion of the drug differs between dialysis and non - dialysis patients .
approximately 6% of patients undergoing dialysis have malignancies , and the number of these patients undergoing chemotherapy continues to increase .
however , the efficacy and safety of imatinib treatment in dialysis patients remain unclear because clinical trials have not been conducted in this population .
