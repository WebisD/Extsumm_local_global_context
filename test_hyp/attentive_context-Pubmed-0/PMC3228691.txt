our study showed that ( 1 ) the rb is a spheroid structure occurring naturally during endodiogeny of rh strain ( 2 ) is possible to observe this structure as soon as the first parasite division takes place , and it is formed simultaneously to the organization of the mnn ; ( 3 ) it is limited by a membrane and it is probably formed from the first division by a pinching event of the posterior end membrane and through secretion of parasite 's components ; ( 4 ) during endodiogeny , daughter , tachyzoites remain attached to the rb membrane showing a continuity between the rb and tachyzoites cytoplasm ; ( 5 ) while the mnn determines interparasite cohesion , the rb defines the spatial position in the rosette organization , acting like an organizing center during proliferating as a strategy to allow successful coordinated parasite division ; ( 6 ) the rb may contain cytoplasmic organelles , such as mitochondria , nuclear fragments , and dense granules ; ( 7 ) during exteriorization , the rb could determine the adequate parasite orientation with the aim to favor an efficient egress through individual routes of exteriorization ; ( 8) the ability of exteriorization of the parasites attached to the rb indicates they are mature enough to display all the events involved in exteriorization , such as motility , conoid extrusion , and ropthry secretion , and the rb does not represent an obstacle for such dynamic secretory processes ; ( 9 ) interdigitated distribution in tachyzoites around the rb could optimize the intravacuolar space during proliferation ; ( 10 ) lack of gra2 protein produced atypical amorphous mnn and rb and absence of rosettes .
