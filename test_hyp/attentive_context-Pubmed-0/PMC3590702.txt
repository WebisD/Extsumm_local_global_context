the purpose of this study was ( 1 ) to analyze the overall and comparative clinico - radiological outcomes ( radiographic and ultrasonographic ) of surgical treatment of distal clavicle fractures associated with complete coracoclavicular ligament disruption , and ( 2 ) to identify and analyze radiographic patterns of fracture and comminution that are associated with this injury .
a combination of a locking distal radius plate with coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction resulted in stable fixation and significantly lower reoperation rates , and should be used preferentially in lesser comminuted fractures ( types 1 and 2 ) .
however , a significant difference in the reoperation rate for implant removal ( p < 0.05 ) in patients treated with a joint - spanning implant probably implies that a joint - sparing implant could be preferentially used whenever fracture geometry permits .
. internal fixation of these fractures necessitates the use of acromioclavicular joint spanning implants ( clavicle hook plate , synthes , usa ) that overcome distraction forces by subacromial leverage ; however , subacromial / acromioclavicular joint encroachment with these implants is associated with subacromial pathology , and this may negatively influence the final outcomes . to overcome the shortcomings of the joint - spanning implants , acromioclavicular joint - sparing implants ( 2.4 mm lcp distal radius plates , synthes , usa ) have been suggested .
