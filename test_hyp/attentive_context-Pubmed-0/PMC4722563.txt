we describe a case where a traumatic unstable scfe that was initially treated with closed reduction and fixation with a single transphyseal screw went on to hardware failure with recurrence of the deformity .
follow - up at 9 months demonstrates a fused physis and no signs of avascular necrosis of the femoral head .
the complication was successfully treated with closed reduction and re - cannulating the fractured screw within the epiphysis and extracting it using a conical extraction screw commonly referred to as an  easy out . 
percutaneous screw fixation is a well - accepted treatment for this disorder for over 20 years but management of complications is not well elucidated in the literature .
percutaneous management of scfe screw breakage is possible utilizing specialized instruments and a precise and gentle manipulation preventing the need for more invasive treatments with their obligatory potential complications profile .
scfe occurs in 10 per 100,000 in some regions of the united states with the incidence continuing to increase .
percutaneous management of scfe screw breakage is possible utilizing specialized instruments and a precise and gentle manipulation preventing the need for more invasive treatments with their obligatory potential complications profile .
it is important to remember to approach new problems with an open mind . if it is possible to reach a goal with a delicate finesse technique through an indirect approach this may be in the patient s best interest or at least worth the attempt before committing to the more invasive procedure .
