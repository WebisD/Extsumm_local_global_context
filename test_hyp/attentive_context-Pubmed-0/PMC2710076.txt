the current problem of a low level of statistical evidence in urology literature coupled with a significant lag between abstract presentation and a full - text publication represent a lack of understanding of , and comfort with , statistics .
urologists need to be less intimidated by biostatistics . as important as the stethoscope , statistical sense is crucial to evaluate research findings and examining patient research .
clinical decision - making should be founded on the highest level of evidence available . according to current hierarchies , randomized control trials ( rcts )
this is reflected in errors in statistical usage that can be corrected by increased awareness of the problem and readiness to act by improving medical education of statistics .
if not just for clinical decision - making , at least the physicians have a mechanism of expressing to patients why they are making a particular decision .
medicine is evolving at a rapid pace with publications increasing to the rate that journals have a backlog of articles that see print six months after acceptance . at this pace ,
failure to publish is problematic for two main reasons : 1 ) clinicians looking to apply research findings lack the necessary detail in abstracts to critically appraise a given study for validity and impact ; 2 ) it is wasteful of resources , unethical , and can lead to unnecessary replication of studies .
