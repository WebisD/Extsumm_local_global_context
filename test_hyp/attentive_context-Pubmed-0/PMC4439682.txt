thirty patients with zygomatic complex fractures were treated with one point fixation [ figures 13 ] .
we also found that one point fixation with a single mini plate at the zygomatic buttress through intraoral incision provided excellent stability and esthetics in the selected cases of simple zygomatic complex fractures without any comminution of the zygoma or the lateral orbital rim without or with minimal displacement and none of our patient complained of pain or palpation or bony movements in the postoperative study period of 6 months rather they were happy to get operated without any unaesthetic facial scars .
for all the patients , immediate postoperative and 6 months postoperative peripheral nerve stimulation x - rays were taken , and the x - rays review successful reduction .
since intraoral approach was used , all the patients had an aesthetic facial profile without any unsightly scars .
none of the patients complained of any paresthesia , bony movements or pain in the frontozygomatic or zygomatic buttress region .
the integrity of the zygoma bone is critical in maintaining normal facial width and prominence of the cheek .
rowe 's zygomatic elevator was then inserted behind the infra temporal surface of the zygoma , and bone was reduced into its correct anatomical position using superior , lateral and anterior force . an audible click and fullness of the cheek together with palpation for normal contour of the zygomatic bone and orbital rim gave an idea about the adequacy of the reduction .
