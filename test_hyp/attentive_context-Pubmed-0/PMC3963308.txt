as the search for an ideal preventive therapy continued , a new and innovative therapy in the form of calcium gluconate infusion was introduced in the armamentarium of reproductive specialists to prevent this potentially dreadful complication , however , data and literature on its effectiveness is presently limited . in the present study , we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous ( iv ) calcium infusion in comparison to the dopamine agonist cb2 in preventing ohss in high risk patients undergoing assisted reproductive technique cycles .
comparison of cycle characteristics in the two treatment group the occurrence of ohss was seen in only nine patients ( 9.2% ) in the calcium infusion group , as compared to 16 patients ( 15.4% ) who were administered cb2 .
we can say that even though both the drugs were found to be equally effective for the prevention of ohss and most importantly in decreasing the severity of this potentially life - threatening complication , their effect on the implantation process and the comparison of the pregnancy rate , implantation rate and miscarriage rate was not computed which accounts for the limitation of this study .
it was observed that there was no significant difference in terms of female age ( years ) , body mass index ( kg / m ) , duration of infertility ( years ) , basal hormone levels ( fsh [ miu / ml ] ) , basal antral follicle count , length of ovarian stimulation ( days ) , number of follicles on the day of hcg trigger and the number of oocytes retrieved in both the study groups [ table 1 ] .
