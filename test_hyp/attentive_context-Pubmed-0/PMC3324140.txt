the aim of this population - based study was to describe perinatal characteristics in infants diagnosed with neuronal migration disorders aiming at identifying potential risk factors .
this descriptive study indicates that there might be an impact of low or subnormal maternal bmi before and during pregnancy , maternal infection , such as rubella , and maternal smoking on fetal brain development , including neuronal migration .
the roles of maternal bmi and congenital infections should be tested in future analytical studies .
the infants included in the study were identified as those hospitalized with a diagnosis related to a neuronal migration abnormality and confirmed by a computer tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
the mean bmi of the mothers at first antenatal visit was 21.3 ( range 17.628.5 ) .
maternal care for ( suspected ) damage to the fetus by radiation was reported in one case .
nine male infants and eight female infants were born after mean 39.3 gestational weeks and with a mean birth weight of 3327 grams .
one of the mothers was underweight with a bmi below 19 at the start of pregnancy , and none was obese .
