there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding prescribing practices for pregnant women with severe and persistent psychiatric disorders .
the use of appropriate animal models may be crucial in understanding the effects of these drugs on fetal growth and development which have profound consequences for the long - term health of the offspring .
the physician and the mother have to balance the risks of untreated psychiatric illness , during pregnancy , against the potential fetal toxicity of atypical antipsychotic medications .
the adverse metabolic side - effects of these medications compound the risks associated with teratogenicity . given that the number of women exposed to atypical antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy is increasing ,
women of childbearing age appear to be particularly susceptible to the exacerbation of existing mental illness and the development of new mental illness   .
historically , antipsychotics have been extensively and effectively used for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , and more recently they are becoming part of the treatment of depression   .
untreated psychiatric disease during pregnancy is associated with increased risks for the mother ( including self - harm / suicide , self - neglect , and reduced compliance with prenatal and postnatal care ) and risks for the child ( including impaired fetal development , infanticide , and impaired mother - child bonding ) ( reviewed in   ) .
