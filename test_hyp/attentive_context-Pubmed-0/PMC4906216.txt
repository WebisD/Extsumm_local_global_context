these results indicated that there is an increase of the mcp-1 and ccl-11 secretion under hypoxic stress , and all are suppressed by lbi pretreatment .   to confirm that lbi effectiveness is related to suppression of mcp-1 or ccl-11
the level of mcp-1 increased significantly after the addition of cocl2 , and it was significantly decreased after the addition of cocl2 after lbi pretreatment ( control , 279.7  68.3 ; with cocl2 , 340.8  43.3 ; and with cocl2 after lbi pretreatment , 182.6  23.8  pg / ml , p < 0.05 ; nonrepeated anova ; figure 2(c ) ) .
it must also be noted that the cost of anti - vegf therapy is quite high and continuous injections to control the dme can become an economic issue .
diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in developed countries .
but there still remain patients who do not respond to the anti - vegf therapy   and who had a reduction of their vision even after therapy .
the results of the elisa measurements of the conditioned culture media ( n = 5 ) indicated that il-8 was not significantly changed after the addition of cocl2 or after pretreatment with lbi ( control , 6.9  0.1 ; with cocl2 , 6.8  0.1 ; and with cocl2 after lbi pretreatment , 6.9  0.1  pg / ml ; figure 2(a ) ) .
