in contrast , systolic bp , used as an adjusted factor in model 3 in table 2 , showed significant associations with proteinuria in subjects with diabetes , prediabetes , and normal glucose tolerance ( data not shown ) . or for the highest quintile of pulse pressure in the association of proteinuria ( 1 + ) according to the presence of diabetes or prediabetes or ( 95% ci ) for proteinuria in diabetes ( n = 27,913 ) finally , we analyzed the association of a + 1 sd increase of pulse pressure ( + 13 mmhg ) , rather than pulse pressure as a dichotomous variable , with proteinuria in patients with diabetes .
when we examined the association between pulse pressure and proteinuria only in patients with diabetes whose systolic bp was within the normal range ( i.e. , < 130 mmhg , n
next , a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the independent association between the highest quintile of pulse pressure and proteinuria , separately in subjects with diabetes , prediabetes , and normal glucose tolerance . in patients with diabetes , the highest quintile of pulse pressure ( 63 mmhg )
in this nationwide study of 228,778 japanese people ( mean age 63.2 years ) who had no known cardiovascular disease , we demonstrated for the first time that there was a significant difference in the association between the highest quintile of pulse pressure ( 63 mmhg ) and proteinuria ( 1 + on dipstick ) among subjects with diabetes , prediabetes , and normal glucose tolerance .
