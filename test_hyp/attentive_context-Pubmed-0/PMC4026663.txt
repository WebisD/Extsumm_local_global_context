hyaluronic acid installation is an effective gag substitution therapy in patients with bps / ic . instilling hyaluronic acid via emda
the results of the multivariable cox proportional hazards regression showed that treatment with emda , positive kcl test result , and voiding frequency > 17 were associated with higher response rates .
, we designed the present randomized prospective study to evaluate whether intravesical hyaluronic acid installation with emda would improve the response rate and long - term efficacy of the therapy .
can improve the efficacy of the treatment ; however , lack of long - term efficacy is the major problem of this gag substitution therapy .
, results in patients with t1 bladder cancer improved in patients administered bacille calmette - gurin ( bcg ) and mitomycin via emda compared with the group administered bcg alone . electromotive mitomycin increases tissue uptake compared with passive diffusion . given that instillation of hyaluronic acid via emda may increase tissue uptake and improve efficacy
baseline voiding symptoms were recorded in 2-day voiding diaries , a visual analogue scale ( vas ) was used to assess worst pain , and ic symptom and problem indexes were used to assess ic . at visits at 1 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months , the patients returned 2-day voiding diaries , marked the vas score , filled out the symptom and problem questionnaires , and gave the global response assessment ( gra ) .
