 given the result of the present study , autologous hair follicle harvesting through punch biopsy direct transplanting into the hairy and non - glabrous areas could effectively initiate re - pigmentation of depigmented areas in segmental vitiligo . as it may form tiny scars , it is better to apply in the hairy areas . since segmental vitiligo is a rare form of the disease , further multi central studies or studies with and an appropriate sample size
the hair follicular transplantation effect on re - pigmentation of affected areas in segmental vitiligo was evaluated . 

depigmented skin areas were located in the face of 4 patients ( 40 % ) , extremities of 4 patients ( 40 % ) and in the trunk of the body of 2 patients ( 20 % ) .
afterward , all the patients had detectable re - pigmented area of at least 2 mm and maximum of 9 mm during 6 month ( fig.1,2 ) .

 we analyzed data for eight male ( 80% ) and two female ( 20 % ) patients within an age range of 21 to 43 , who were enrolled into the study .
re - pigmentation was detectable in 6 cases ( 60 % ) following 2 weeks procedure .
