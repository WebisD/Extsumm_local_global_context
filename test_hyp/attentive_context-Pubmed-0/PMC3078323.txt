the goal of this paper is to provide a brief overview of the basic principles of a modern qca software package , particularly on the field of coronary bifurcation analysis .
semi - automated segmentation techniques are able to detect the luminal boundaries of coronary arteries from two - dimensional digital x - ray arteriograms after minimal user interaction .
qca can be used in an off - line mode for clinical research studies and in an on - line mode during the interventional procedure to support the clinical decision - making process .
in interventional cardiology , quantitative coronary arteriography ( qca ) has been used for on - line vessel sizing for the selection of the interventional devices and the assessment of the efficacy of the individual procedures , for the on - line selection of patients to be included or excluded in clinical trials based on quantitative parameters ( e.g. small vessel disease ) , and for training purposes .
