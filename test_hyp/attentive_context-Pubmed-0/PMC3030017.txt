moreover , intraoperative tee is highly useful for confirming dynamic lvoto and to provide the surgeon with therapeutic guidance .
, dynamic lvoto should be ruled out in patients with refractory hemodynamic instability during lt although no evidence of lvoto is found on the screening echocardiography .
reported that a dynamic lvoto with sam developed intraoperatively in a patient with a normal stress echocardiogram preoperatively and who underwent lt .
in addition , lt is associated with further decreases in the left ventricular preload secondary to intraoperative bleeding or surgical interruption of the inferior vena cava ( the preanhepatic and anhepatic period ) and the decrease of systemic vascular resistance after recirculation of the donor liver ( the postreperfusion period ) .
we next used phenylephrine to increase the systemic vascular resistance and esmolol ( an ultrashort acting beta - blocker ) to improve the degree of obstruction by decreasing both the chronotropic and inotroic state of the left ventricle and inhibiting the profound beta - adrenergic mediated splanchnic vasodilation that is common in patients with end stage liver disease . for case 2 ,
the tee played an important role in diagnosing and managing the dynamic lvoto in our cases .
