we evaluated the improvement of hydronephrosis longitudinally using us and ivp after retroperitoneal laparoscopic dismembered anderson 
between january 2006 and june 2012 , 16 patients with upjo were treated by retroperitoneal laparoscopic dismembered anderson 
rate of improvement in hydronephrosis as determined on us and ivp after laparoscopic pyeloplasty us = ultrasound ; ivp = intravenous pyelography the change of t1/2 of the diuretic renal scan after laparoscopic pyeloplasty
hydronephrosis improves relatively more rapidly and for a longer period of time in adults compared to pediatric patients .
complete resolution of the hydronephrosis was observed in 8 of 16 patients ( 50% ) .
improvement in the degree of hydronephrosis by two grades was observed in 6% , 27% , 33% , 50% , and 60% of patients at 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 months , respectively ( table 2 ) .
the degree of hydronephrosis decreased to grade 1 and grade 2 at 6 months , respectively , but no further improvement of hydronephrosis was observed at 24 months . in the third patient who had grade 3 hydronephrosis preoperatively , the degree of hydronephrosis decreased to grade 2 at 3 months and continued to decrease gradually until complete resolution was obtained at 24 months .
