, we describe a patient with lung cancer and a pure ggn in the left lower lung lobe that persisted after several limited resections and was successfully treated with cryoablation .
a pure ground - glass nodule ( ggn ) in the lung may represent an early lung malignancy , such as adenocarcinoma in situ ( ais ) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma ( mia ) ( 1 ) .
our results show the potential of cryoablation as a new treatment method for ggn , particularly in patients in whom surgery is contraindicated .
a 59-year - old woman visited our hospital due to abnormal chest radiography findings on a health maintenance exam at another hospital .
cryoablation has been explored as an option for treating metastatic lesions in patients with non - small cell lung cancer who can not undergo surgery or chemotherapy ( 5 ) . however , no clinical reports of cryoablation techniques applied to multiple ggns in the lung have been published . here
two similar nodules in the right upper and right lower lobes were identified during surgery as mia and ais , respectively .
thus , long - term follow - up may be necessary to determine the outcome of cryoablation for treating pure ggns . in conclusion
