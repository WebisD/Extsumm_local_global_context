we studied fibrinolytic activity , as measured by tpa and pai-1 activity , and a marker of endothelial dysfunction , as measured by tpa antigen , in a population sample with normal glucose tolerance at baseline and analysed data according to conversion to diabetes or not over nine years of follow - up .
changes in endothelial function are independent from the insulin resistance syndrome and point towards a distinctly different pathway both for cardiovascular disease and for the development of diabetes . to answer a classical question from 1990    yes
the early prediabetic state , with normal glucose tolerance , is characterised by both impaired fibrinolysis and endothelial dysfunction years before glucose levels increase .
the risk of developing diabetes increased with increasing quartiles of tpa antigen and pai-1 activity and decreased in a similar way for tpa activity ( figure 1 ) . in the highest quartile of tpa antigen ( above 8.7
the risk of developing diabetes or igt during follow up ( n = 66 ) increased stepwise across quartiles of tpa antigen , from 7.8% to 19.8% ( p = 0,003 , test for linear trend ) . when adjusted for age and sex , the odds ratio for the highest vs. the three lower quartiles of tpa antigen was 1.9 ( ci 1.011.6 , p = 0.04 ) but diminished further when also waist circumference was adjusted for , or = 1.3 ( ci 0.636.5 , p = 0.5 ) .
