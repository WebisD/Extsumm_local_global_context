we present one such patient who had features suggestive of right ureteric colic and presented with retained barium in the appendix .
a 28 years old male attended our outdoor with an 8 days old x - ray film showing tubular radio - opacity in the right iliac fossa region .
if a person presents with retained barium in the appendix , no appendectomy should be performed in absence of findings suggestive of acute appendicitis .
however studies have failed to establish a cause and effect relationship between barium retention in the appendix and subsequent development of the appendicitis .
finding of small renal calculi in right kidney suggested that the etiology could be ureteric colic .
it is still not advisable to perform appendectomy in such circumstances without the evidence of an acute episode .
baroliths have been conclusively retrieved from appendectomy specimen , even after 3 months following barium study in patients with acute appendicitis . despite these case
reports studies have failed to prove the cause and effect relationship between barium study and acute appendicitis .
based on above we conclude that the decision to perform appendectomy should be based on the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and that the prolonged retention of barium in the appendix is not an indication for surgery . in our case since no signs or symptoms were suggestive of acute appendicitis , the active search for other causes were made .
