the esophageal temperatures decreased significantly from tintu at t15-t105 in the saline control group ( p values were in the order of 0.040 , 0.006 , < 0.001 , < 0.001 , < 0.001 , < 0.001 , < 0.001 ) and at t45-t105 in the aminophylline group ( p values were in the order of 0.039 , 0.011 , 0.002 ,
this effect is associated with adverse outcomes including impaired coagulation ( 3 ) , increased incidence of surgical wound infections , prolonged hospitalization ( 4 ) , and myocardial ischemia ( 5 ) . despite the absence of environmental exposure of a wound or abdominal viscera ,
esophageal temperatures at t45 , t60 , t75 , t90 , t105 ( p values are in the order of 0.024 , 0.053 , 0.025 , 0.011 , 0.017 ) and index finger temperatures at t15 , t30 , t45 , t60 , t75 , t90 , t105 ( p values are in the order of 0.001 , 0.029 , 0.020 , 0.010 , 0.028 , 0.042 , 0.024 ) were significantly higher than in the saline control group ( table 1 ) ( fig .
we found that an intraoperative infusion of aminophylline reduced the decreases in core and skin temperature during lvh requiring pneumoperitoneum .
