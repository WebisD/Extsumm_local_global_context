pfeifer incisions can successfully provide mucosal length , vermilion fullness , and lip symmetry in patients with moderate median cleft lip .
a five - year - old boy with a facial cleft presented to our clinic . on examination
we report using a pfeifer incision to correct a moderate true median cleft of the upper lip .
since the presentation of midline cleft deformities varies widely , each case should be individually considered and treated .
the postoperative results were excellent and proper approximation of the orbicularis oris muscle and the vermilion was achieved with a symmetrical cupid 's bow and philtrum .
treatment of median clefts depends on the clinical presentation and may vary from simple alignment of orbicularis oris and vermilion , to reconstruction of the cupid 's bow and philtrum for true median clefts , and complex craniofacial procedures in case of false median clefts .
a median cleft can also be called midline cleft or vertical cleft through the centre of the upper lip , and is a rare anomaly , the exact developmental origin of which is not clear .
median clefts are broadly classified into true and false ; false clefts are due to agenesis of the medial nasal process , while true clefts are due to failure of the medial nasal process to fuse .
