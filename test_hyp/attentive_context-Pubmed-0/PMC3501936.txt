the null hypotheses tested were ( 1 ) 35% hp bleaching agent does not increase the susceptibility of enamel to erosive challenges and ( 2 ) there is no difference in erosion susceptibility of enamel that has been treated with hydrogen peroxide compared to enamel treated with hydrogen peroxide supplemented with calcium or fluoride .
considering the experimental design , it can be concluded that the application of 35% hp - based bleaching agents did not alter the enamel susceptibility to erosion , and the addition of calcium to the bleaching gel improved erosion resistance of the bleached enamel .
therefore , the objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of bleaching agents based on 35% hydrogen peroxide modified or not by the addition of calcium or fluoride on the susceptibility of enamel to erosion .
however , specimens from group hp + ca had significantly less mean enamel wear compared to the control after the erosive challenges , while the groups hp and hp + f did not differ from the control .
the erosive cycles consisted of immersion in unstirred soft drink ( 20  ml / sample , sprite zero , companhia fluminense de refrigerantes , porto real , rj , brazil ) , ph 2.8 , four times per day for 2  min each time , followed by a remineralizing period of 2  h between erosive challenges ( immersion in unstirred artificial saliva , ph 7.0 , 20  ml / sample ) , at room temperature in small containers .
