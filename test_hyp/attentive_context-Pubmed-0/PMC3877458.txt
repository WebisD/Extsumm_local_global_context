the main goal of this study was to review the role and situation of nps in the new reform for better use of their capabilities in health care services .
this is a qualitative , comparative ( role of nurses in family physicians team ) , and cross - sectional study that was carried out with triangulation method in three stages in 2011 . in the first stage , we conducted a literature review to design a conceptual framework .
now , people in most of the countries use professional and educated nurses [ called nurse practitioner ( np ) ] besides family physician or are under their supervision for diagnosis , treatment , and specifically health education of the family . in accordance with the international council of nurses definition ,
in addition , most graduate nurses in our community can play an important role in preventing medicine and family physician team . consequently , in spite of their ability and capacity , they have a brief role in our family physician team & their job description .
it was hoped that phc would address some of the major inequalities in health that were observed by a balanced system of treatment and disease prevention . the world health organization ( who ) envisaged that phc would take place as close as possible to where people live and work and be the first element of a continuing health care process .
