our aim is to evaluate the effect of vitamin d correction to a patient with new onset graves disease ( gd ) with an underlying vitamin d deficiency .
a healthy saudi woman in her 40s sought consultation with a three - month history of palpitation .
we describe the effect of vitamin d3 on untreated graves disease with vitamin d deficiency .
vitamin d 25-oh level was done in our hospital and showed a result of 26.0 nmol / l with a tsh , 0.013 miu / l ; ft4 , 16.7
tc-99 m thyroid scintigraphy demonstrated an enlarged thyroid gland with increased radiotracer trapping and heterogeneous distribution .
besides its classical role in calcium and bone homeostasis , vitamin d is considered a potent immunomodulator that can affect the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases .
the initial thyroid function test , which was done in an outside hospital , revealed a tsh , 0.01 miu / l ; ft4 , 22.5
the patient was given only oral cholecalciferol 4000 iu per day since november 2012 ( prescribed by an outside hospital ) then from may 2013 onwards she was given 50,000 iu per month .
follow - up laboratory exams revealed improved vitamin d levels as well as tsh and ft4 .
