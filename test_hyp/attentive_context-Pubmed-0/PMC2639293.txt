identification of specific subtypes of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients can provide important prognostic information , but to be effective , the method used must recognize all tumor cell types .
the subtype of 19 well - characterized breast cancer cell lines was obtained by use of gene expression profiling , including normal - like , basal - like , her2-positive , and luminal a and b. cells from each line were mixed with blood from a healthy donor and subjected to the cellsearch circulating tumor cell assay .

identification of specific subtypes of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients can provide important prognostic information , but to be effective , the method used must recognize all tumor cell types .
normal - like breast cancer cells have especially aggressive features , and so assays that recognize this subtype would provide valuable prognostic information .
