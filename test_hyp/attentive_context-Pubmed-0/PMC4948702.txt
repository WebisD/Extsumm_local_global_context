effectiveness of the dtrax posterior cervical cage stabilization in limiting motions in flexion  extension ( fe ) , lateral bending ( lb ) , and axial rotation ( ar ) will be comparable to that of an acdf construct for a single - level fusion .
this study tested the following hypotheses : 
 effectiveness of the dtrax posterior cervical cage stabilization in limiting motions in flexion  extension ( fe ) , lateral bending ( lb ) , and axial rotation ( ar ) will be comparable to that of an acdf construct for a single - level fusion.supplemental posterior stabilization will significantly increase the effectiveness of the acdf construct in single- and two - level settings .
supplementation of plated acdf with these implants further increases cervical spine stability in single and multilevel acdf constructs .
the biomechanical effectiveness of bilateral posterior cages in limiting cervical segmental motion is comparable to single - level plated acdf .
supplemental stabilization with the cages at c3c5 further significantly reduced rom when compared to plated acdf alone : values decreased from 1.70.9 to 0.30.2 in fe , 1.70.6 to 0.20.1 in lb , and 2.1 0.5 to 0.30.2 in ar ( all p<0.05 ) ( table 3 ) .
