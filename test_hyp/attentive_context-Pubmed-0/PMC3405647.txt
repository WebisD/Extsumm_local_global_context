to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy , we undertook a retrospective analysis to compare the rates of posttransplant infection in patients whose peritransplant antimicrobial regimens were determined using the mcbt versus those who had their antibiotics chosen via conventional sensitivity testing .
p. aeruginosa was recovered from the posttransplant pleural fluid of one patient ( 2% ) in the mcbt group , as opposed to six ( 7.6% ) in the conventional group ( p = 0.25 ) .
the occurrence of gram - negative sepsis was statistically lower in the mcbt group , and p. aeruginosa was responsible for only one case of septicaemia compared with seven in the conventional therapy group ( see table 2 ) .
the data presented is the first indication that patients given antibiotics based on mcbt results had significantly lower rates of septicaemia and lower rates of positive microbiological cultures in their pleural effusions .
this is an encouraging finding , lending credence to the need for multi - centre prospective studies to be performed that will ideally lead to no patients being turned down for a lung transplant on the basis of colonisation with resistant microorganisms .
we performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for cf between january 2000 and august 2010 .
