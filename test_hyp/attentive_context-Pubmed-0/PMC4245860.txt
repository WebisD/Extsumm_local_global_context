the aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance and failure pattern of 
 endodontically treated mandibular premolars restored with different ferrule heights in 
 combination with fiber posts and all - ceramic crowns .
insertion of a fiber post could reduce the percentage of 
 catastrophic failure of these restorations under functional loads .
all 
 external debris were removed with an ultrasonic scaler , and examined stereoscopically 
 at 10x magnification to verify the absence of cracks , defects and dental caries . 

although fracture resistance of the control group was 
 comparable to that of the other groups that received fiber post , there was a higher 
 catastrophic failure rate ( 70% ) in the control specimens in the form of vertical root 
 fracture .
the groups restored with fiber post , on the other hand , had almost complete 
 favorable fracture in the form of cervical fracture above the cervical line , previous 
 data are summarized in table 1 . failure load ( standard deviation ) and failure type of tested groups similar superscript letter indicates no significant difference between 
 different test groups in all specimens , the cemented ceramic crown was fractured without evidence of debonding 
 of either the crown or the cemented post .
