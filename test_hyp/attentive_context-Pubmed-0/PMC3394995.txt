, this case report demonstrates a two - step mucosal dehiscence coverage technique for an endosseous implant .
a 33-year - old female visited us with the chief complaint of dissatisfaction with the esthetics of an exposed implant in the maxillary left cental incisor region .
this two - step approach has the potential to improve the certainty of esthetic results .
soft tissue recessions frequently cause esthetic disharmony and dissatisfaction . compared with soft tissue coverage around a tooth ,
the coverage of an implant site is obviously unpredictable . particularly in the cases of thin mucosa
an esthetically satisfactory result was achieved and the marginal soft tissue level was stable 9 months after the second graft .
a subepithelial connective tissue graft was positioned in the apical site of the implant and covered by a mucosal flap with normal tension . at 12 months after surgery
, a significant greater amount of recession takes place compared to thick mucosa . to overcome this problem
, the recipient site was partially covered by keratinized mucosa . however , the buccal interdental papilla between implant on maxillary left central incisor region and adjacent lateral incisor was concave in shape . to resolve the mucosal recession after the first graft
