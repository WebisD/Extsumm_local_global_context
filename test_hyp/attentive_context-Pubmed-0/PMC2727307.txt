our data suggest that the introduction of tnf blockade into the clinical practice is 
                 associated with increasing reports of leishmaniasis in patients with autoimmune 
                 rheumatic diseases who live in leishmaniasis - endemic areas of europe .
therefore , the use of anti - tnf treatment is likely going to increase , 
                 possibly causing a parallel increase in opportunistic infections such as 
                 leishmaniasis .
finally , due to underreporting , the reported cases 
                 may underestimate the real incidence of leishmaniasis among patients with autoimmune 
                 rheumatic diseases .
this is 
                 particularly important since currently only a few patients with autoimmune rheumatic 
                 diseases receive anti - tnf agents ( 15 ) .
it is unclear for all cases ( with 1 exception ) presented 
                 in this article whether leishmaniasis was primary infection or reactivation of 
                 latent disease .
however , all cases of leishmaniasis in patients with autoimmune 
                 rheumatic diseases were reported after 1998 , the year of introduction of anti - tnf 
                 agents , and most ( 9/15 ) of the reported leishmaniasis cases occurred during the past 
                 5 years ( 20042008 ) , mainly among patients receiving anti - tnf agents ( 6 
                 of the 9 patients with leishmaniasis ; 66.6% ) .
