although kii als / pdc shows several unique clinical features , including severe atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes on magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , decreased cerebral blood flow in the frontal and temporal lobes on single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) , pigmentary retinopathy , and decreased cardiac i - meta - iodobenzylguanidine uptake , a postmortem examination is required for a definitive diagnosis . since biomarkers for als
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / parkinsonism - dementia complex ( als / pdc ) is a rare disorder endemic to guam island and the kii peninsula of japan .
/ pdc have not yet been identified , we analyzed cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) biomarkers for kii als / pdc to discriminate it from other neurodegenerative disorders .
the ratios of csf - p - tau to csf - a42 were significantly increased in ad ( 0.125  0.02 ) compared with kii als / pdc ( 0.043  0.02 ; p < 0.008 ) , als ( 0.035  0.019 ; p < 0.003 ) , pd ( 0.025  0.02 ; p < 0.002 ) , and c ( 0.027  0.09 ; p
finally , the present findings , in which csf - t - tau and csf - p - tau concentrations were not increased and csf - a42 concentration was relatively decreased , suggest that csf analysis may be useful to differentiate als / pdc from ad , als , and pd . nevertheless there is a major limitation of the interpretation of the data .
