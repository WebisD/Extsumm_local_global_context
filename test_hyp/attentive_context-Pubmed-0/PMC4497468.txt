the occurrence of chromosomal morbidity , reproductive defects , and common genomic disorders in 0.65% , 0.2% , and 0.18% , respectively , of newborns indicated that the baseline of prenatal cytogenomic diagnosis should be set on at least 1% but most likely up to 3% of pregnant women if including other genomic abnormalities and gene mutations .
this information will be useful for the obstetricians , clinical geneticists , and laboratory staff to further improve the quality of prenatal diagnosis .
the diagnostic yield for chromosomal abnormalities showed a significant increase from 7.2% in 2000 to 13.4% in 2012 ( p<0.01 ) and the overall diagnostic yield was 9.6% .
of13 years , prenatal evaluation using ama / aus was the most effective in detecting chromosomal abnormalities , but better indications for genomic abnormalities are needed .
diagnostic prenatal cytogenomic tests should be performed on 176 to 528 fetuses from 17 600 pregnancies ; the 2012 caseload of 365 in this laboratory is within the baseline level .
although the annual caseload of cvs and af showed a significant 57.2% decrease from 853 cases in 2000 to 365 cases in 2012 ( p<0.01 ) , there was no significance change in the number of abnormal findings ( figure 1d ) .
