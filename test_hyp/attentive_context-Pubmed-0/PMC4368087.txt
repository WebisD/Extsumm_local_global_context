different quartz samples showed 
 a large discrepancy of their ina . 
 with the presented idea of domains of molecular sites able to bind 
 and arrange water molecules in an ice - like structure acting as ice 
 nucleation sites
, we suggest that the history of the quartz particles 
 and dust particles in general has an important influence .
ina is enhanced 
 by introducing more defects to a quartz surface by mechanical milling . 

the feldspars are more ice nucleation active than most quartz samples , 
 and k - feldspar is by far the most active in of the feldspar family
the ice 
 nucleation behavior of various mineral samples was investigated with 
 a special focus on feldspars , which are known to be among the most 
 ice nucleation active species .
in addition , we characterized the particles with field 
 emission gun scanning electron microscopy ( feg - sem ) and tunneling 
 electron microscopy ( tem ) , energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) , 
 x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) , and attenuated total reflection fourier 
 transform infrared spectroscopy ( atr - ftir ) . combining these data we 
 propose a possible explanation why specific minerals , in particular 
 k - feldspars , are good in , whereas others are not .
