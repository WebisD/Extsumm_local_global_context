however , few 
 studies have kinematically examined ct movement in individuals with tetraplegia . the purpose of the present study was to examine the kinematic characteristics and explore 
 the most efficient methods of ct movement in individuals with tetraplegia , focusing on trunk 
 and hip joint movement .
the duration of the ct movement ranged from 9 to 39  s ( table 2table 2.duration of the ct movement , trunk inclination angle , and hip angle recorded for

however , a significant correlation was observed between the hip angle and duration 
 ( =0.67 , p<0.05 ) . in other words ,
the purpose of this study was to examine the kinematic characteristics of individuals with 
 tetraplegia and identify the most efficient method of ct movement for them , with a focus on 
 trunk and hip joint movement .
no correlation was found between the asia motor score and duration ( =0.07 , 
 p>0.05 ) .
thus , although the trends of the trunk 
 inclination angles and hip angles required for the ct movement have been understood , further 
 studies are needed for a more accurate analysis with a greater number of subjects .
