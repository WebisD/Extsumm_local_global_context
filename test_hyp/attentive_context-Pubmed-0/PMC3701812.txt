there is no question that the presences of cytotoxic t - cell lymphocytes permeating a neoplastic process have some relevance in helping to achieve a beneficial response . in a recent study from sloan kettering however , in evaluating the presence of til ( tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ) cells in patients with colorectal carcinoma undergoing surgery for liver metastasis , it was found that the existence of cytoxic cells could be shown to have some benefit , but the presence of t- regulatory foxp3 cd8 cells had a negative outcome in terms of survival 6 .
while many different approaches have been investigated in terms of controlling cancer growth including use of those monoclonal antibodies that minimize vascular proliferation or attack epidermal growth factors as well as blocking signaling pathways thru tyrosine kinase inhibitors , we believe that the precision biologic approach using targeted monoclonal therapy is one of the more effective approaches to utilize .
ongoing clinical trials utilizing targeted monoclonal igg1 's directed against immunogenic tumor proteins now appears to offer the best opportunity for controlling if not curing the metastatic malignant process when the naked antibody is delivered in combination with other antitumor agents .
later on , as we achieve our goals in targeting recurrent tumors with our therapeutic antibodies , the use of peptide vaccines , several which have already been designed , will be introduced to help prevent the high rate of recurrence of malignancy seen after complex operations such as the whipple ( pancreatectomy ) .
