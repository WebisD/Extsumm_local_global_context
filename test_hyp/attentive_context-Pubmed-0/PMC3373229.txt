patients with graves orbitopathy have a higher probability of myasthenia gravis than the normal population.1 according to a large retrospective case series , myasthenia gravis was diagnosed in two of 150 patients with graves orbitopathy ( 1.3%).2 patients with graves orbitopathy commonly show eyelid retraction and/or hypotropia and/or esotropia , as well as exophthalmos , lagophthalmos , exposure keratopathy , and less frequently , compressive optic neuropathy.3 however , patients with myasthenia gravis often demonstrate ptosis and/or exotropia , but a consistent pattern of eye movement disturbances is usually not present.3 upper eyelid retraction in graves orbitopathy and myasthenia gravis ( go - mg ) is frequently camouflaged , and these patients may show a normal upper eyelid height .
we herein report a patient with go - mg with left normal eyelid height , but in whom the upper eyelid retraction was disclosed after edrophonium chloride administration .
a 46-year - old man with graves disease , well controlled by thiamazole 5 mg / day , was referred to our clinic to treat his graves orbitopathy .
the upper eyelid height must be carefully monitored in patients with graves orbitopathy to detect the presence of concomitant myasthenia gravis .
