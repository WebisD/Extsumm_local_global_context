dietary intakes of study participants throughout the study insulin level increased ( p = 0.01 ) and hdl - c concentration ( p < 0.001 ) and tc ( p = 0.05 ) decreased in intervention group significantly .
however , tc level decreased , and fasting insulin increased significantly in the intervention group .
we observed no significant effect of hvs on blood sugar and lipid profile between groups except for hdl - c .
insulin level increased ( p = 0.01 ) and hdl - c concentration ( p < 0.001 ) and tc ( p = 0.05 ) decreased in intervention group significantly .
eligible subjects were randomly assigned to either control ( normal diet , n = 36 ) or intervention group ( normal diet plus 21.66 g honey vinegar , n = 36 ) for 4-week .
a total of 56 subjects ( 77.77% ) were included in the analysis of dietary data ( n = 27 and 29 from intervention and control groups , respectively ) .
analysis of covariance was used to compare changes of variables included fbs , insulin , homa - ir , tc , tg , hdl - c , ldl - c and ldl - c / hdl - c between two groups of control and intervention .
