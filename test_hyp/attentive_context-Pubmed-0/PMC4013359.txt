these cells 
 were labeled by seven out of the 21 lectins used in this study . exclusively , uea - i stained 
 the cytoplasm of these cells , but not the nuclei . as far as we know , this is the first 
 report detecting this type of cell in the respiratory epithelium of sheep .
we speculate that 
 the presence of these cells can be attributed to one of the different cell cycle phases of 
 the goblet or ciliated cells , as immature differentiated cells .
for example , lel stained the free borders of 
 both the olfactory and respiratory epithelia , but its staining intensity in the bowman s 
 glands and goblet cells is faint .
twelve lectins stained both the free border of the olfactory epithelium and that of the 
 respiratory epithelium : wga , s - wga , lel , stl , dsl , sba , bsl - i , rca-120 , ecl , con a , pha - e 
 and pha - l , indicating that the expression pattern of glycoconjugate was similar between the 
 free border of these two epithelia .
in the respiratory epithelium , the case was the same 
 as in the olfactory epithelium .
