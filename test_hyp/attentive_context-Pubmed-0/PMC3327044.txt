the advantages of using whole slide imaging for this study include leveraging existing hardware , enhancing the software to facilitate development of other applications , and annotating the wsi so that the cells may be classified and identified in the context of the original image .
the use of wsi technology allows some advantages over the cellavision system including leveraging of capital equipment , expansion of software to include other applications involving wsi , and identifying and localizing the wbcs in the context of the original wsi . while the localization functions were not part of the current study , further work is currently being pursued to implement some of these benefits . viewing the classified cells in their original context on wright stained wsi allows the pathologist to also evaluate red blood cells , platelets , and smear adequacy data in addition to the wbcs .
, we will also perform the elimination of false positives in wbc detection in an automated manner using linear discriminants on the same feature set used for classification .
this technique may facilitate work flow by replacing tedious and monotonous work with automation while maintaining all of the digitized data in the original smear .
