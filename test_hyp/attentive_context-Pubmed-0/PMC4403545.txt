the present study was designed to molecularly differentiate fasciola species and characterize genetic diversity of f. gigantica using nd1gene in the endemic areas of iran .
additional studies involving more isolates and other mitochondrial polymorphic genes , such as that for cytochrome c oxidase gene ( co1 ) , may help us to clarify genetic divergence of f. gigantica worldwide .
the number of different nd1 genotypes obtained in this study demonstrates that , the mitochondrial gene is a suitable marker to show variability within f. gigantica isolates .
, there was little information available on the characterization of iranian f. gigantica existing genotypes based on variations in nadh dehydrogenase subunit 1 ( nd1 ) dna sequences .
the mitochondrial markers have been extensively used for phylogenetic studies and population differentiation because of its relativity rapid rate of evolution , importance in differentiation and discrimination of closely related organism , maternally inherited and does not undergo any recombination ( 26).for example , nadh dehydrogenase subunit 1 gene ( nd1 ) have been shown to be well suited for investigating the population genetics of trematodes , i.e. , f. hepatica ( 27 ) , clonorchis sinensis ( 28 ) and opisthorchis viverrini ( 29 ) . in the present study , mitochondrial nd1 gene was amplified using pcr from all f. gigantica samples and partial sequencing results were compared with previously available sequences in ncbi using blast and compared with other homologues by means of maximum parsimony trees .
