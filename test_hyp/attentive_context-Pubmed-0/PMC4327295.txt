the self - etching systems did not etch the ground and intact enamel surfaces as phosphoric acid etchants did .
the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effects of self - etching adhesive systems and conventional phosphoric acid etchants on the morphology and the acid etching pattern of intact and ground enamel .
all specimens were randomly assigned to twenty - two groups ( n = 4 ) , according to surface treatment of enamel ( ground and unground ) and type of acid etching ( self - etching and phosphoric acid ) .
the acid - etched enamel patterns formed by acidic monomers were observed only on ground surfaces .
their conditioning effects were reduced on intact enamel surfaces , except for tyrian spe system .
no distinct morphological differences between the phosphoric acid concentrations ( 34% and 35% ) were observed on the etched enamel surfaces . 

twenty - two extracted , caries - free erupted human third molars were used in this study according to protocols approved by the institutional review board of the piracicaba school of dentistry 
because the action of self - etching primers resulted in much less demineralization of intact enamel surfaces , enamel abrasion during cavity preparation can favor the formation of a defined etching pattern . since in clinical situations the enamel is usually prepared with dental drills prior to application of the adhesive system
