this study used a protocol to establish six criteria for tracheal decannulation in patients affected by tbi : level of consciousness , respiration , tracheal secretion , phonation , swallowing , and coughing .
therefore , to aid in evaluating a tracheostomized patient 's clinical state for possible decannulation and making speech therapy rehabilitation possible , the main objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability of a protocol tracheal decannulation .
the decreased level of consciousness of the patient has been described as a related factor to oropharyngeal dysphagia and in the literature is associated with aspiration and pneumonia .
this study evaluated 20 patients of both sexes , between 21 and 85 years of age , affected by tbi and tracheostomized with an open cannula .
twenty patients were assessed in this prospective study ; the patients were between 21 and 85 years of age ( average 33.55 ) , and there were 4 women ( 20% ) and 16 men ( 80% ) .
the group that underwent a multidisciplinary treatment showed a significant decrease in mean length of cannulation time to 28 days , compared with those without the approach who had an average of 33 days.9 
  the early speech therapy intervention in a hospital aims a fast identification of dysphagia , which is an important factor for decreasing risks involving aspiration - related pneumonia and poor nutrition and preventing complications arising from the same clinics ; this may reduce hospital stay , leading the patient to an early independence and an improvement of life quality.10 
  speech therapy within an interdisciplinary team is responsible for therapeutic management of dysphagic patient to optimize airway protection , aiming at reintroduction of oral intake in a fast and secure way , as well as helping with the decannulation process.11

  following specific protocols in tracheostomy prescription is common , but there is no protocol description for the decannulation process .
