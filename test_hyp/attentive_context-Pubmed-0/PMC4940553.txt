this cross - sectional observational study uses baseline data from an in - progress clinical trial to explore racial differences in bcrl severity as measured by interlimb volume differences in arm swelling , while accounting for other social , physical , and treatment - related bcrl risk factors , among black and white   breast cancer survivors .
this study was designed to explore differences by race in interlimb arm volume differences among breast cancer survivors with breast cancer - related lymphedema ( bcrl ) , accounting for social and physical risk factors for bcrl . in this sample of overweight women ,
receipt of or adherence to lymphedema care treatment ( 4.10 , p = 0.01 ) was significantly associated with greater interlimb difference .
there was no significant difference in black - white racial distribution across educational categories in this study ( p = 0.37 ) ; however , black women had significantly higher bmi than white women ( 35.0 versus 33.3 ; p = 0.01 ) . in table 2 multivariable linear regression controlling for demographic , clinical , and treatment factors , neither race ( 0.26 , p = 0.89 ) nor bmi ( 0.22 , p = 0.10 ) was associated with interlimb volume difference . completing some time in college
