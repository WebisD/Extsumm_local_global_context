glaucoma and ocular hypertension are progressive , vision - threatening conditions associated with increased intraocular pressure ( iop ) . quigley and broman have reported that , by 2020 , more than 28 million people in asia and nearly 60 million people worldwide will be diagnosed with open - angle glaucoma.1 in japan , glaucoma is the leading cause of visual impairment.2 reducing iop is currently the only established treatment for slowing or preventing progression of open - angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension,3 which , if untreated can lead to visual field defects and blindness.4 multiple classes of iop - lowering agents have been developed for therapeutic use , including carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and beta - adrenergic receptor antagonists ( blockers).3 systemic administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and blockers , among other agents , can produce adverse effects , including malaise , fatigue , and sleep disturbances;5,6 as a result , ophthalmic instillation has been pursued as a route of administration for treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension . many patients require multiple ocular hypotensive agents to achieve sufficient iop reduction.7 topical treatment with the nonselective blocker timolol 0.5% ( tim ) and an adjunctive agent to lower iop has become increasingly common.3,8 concomitant therapy with topical brinzolamide 1% ( brinz ) , a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , and tim has been demonstrated to significantly decrease iop in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.911 both brinz and tim , individually and in combination , are generally well tolerated.1014 concomitant administration of multiple topical agents has been associated with drug washout , increased complexity of administration , and decreased treatment compliance ; these factors can decrease delivery of effective doses of ocular hypotensives.1517 fixed - combination pharmacotherapies of iop - lowering agents eliminate risk of washout and simplify drug administration.16,17 the safety and efficacy of fixed - combination brinzolamide 1%/timolol 0.5% ( brinz / tim - fc ) have been established in adult patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension ; because brinz / tim - fc has been marketed in the european union , earlier studies included mostly white or black patients and relatively few asian patients.1822 in a double - masked , parallel - group study , brinz / tim - fc achieved significantly superior iop reduction compared with brinz or tim monotherapy.22 furthermore , patients transitioned to brinz / tim - fc ( usually because of insufficient iop reduction with or intolerance to their previous treatment ) achieved significant iop reductions from baseline after 46 weeks of therapy , and nearly 90% of patients judged the tolerability of brinz / tim - fc positively.19 the objective of this randomized , double - masked , multicenter , parallel - group , controlled study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brinz / tim - fc compared with concomitant therapy of unfixed brinz and tim ( brinz + tim ) in japanese patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
