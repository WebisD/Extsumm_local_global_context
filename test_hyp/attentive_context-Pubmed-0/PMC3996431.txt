rest 
 vs. pfmc , : pfmc vs. feedback pfmc , : feedback pfmc vs. 
 rest according to the post hoc test result , there were significant differences in the tra 
 between the measurements taken at rest and during the contraction of the pfm , and between 
 those taken at rest and during the contraction of the pfm with visual feedback . in 
 particular , the thickness of the tra was highest during the contraction of the pfm without 
 visual feedback ( table 2 ) .
general characteristics of subjects ( n=29)mean  sdgender ( m / f)29 ( 13/16)age ( yrs)23.22.7heights ( cm)167.27.6weights ( kg)61.011.3 . there were no statistically significant differences in the eo and io between the 
 measurements taken at rest and during the contraction of the pfm , and between those taken at 
 rest and during the contraction of the pfm with visual feedback ( table 2table 2 .
according to the results of the present study , there were no significant differences in the 
 thicknesses of the eo and io during contraction of the pfm between rest and with and without 
 visual feedback when the subjects conducted the abdominal hollowing motion .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to 
 verify whether precise contraction of the pfm using visual feedback actually affects the 
 thickness of the abdominal muscles .
