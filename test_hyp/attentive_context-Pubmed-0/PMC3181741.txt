it is of great importance to raise the awareness of these disorders on the part of pediatricians , physicians , neurologists , psychiatrists , and psychologists .
. these disorders can be relatively easily diagnosed and treated with several available treatment modalities .
yet many cases of crsds are underrecognized and misdiagnosed as psychiatric dlsorders or psychophysiological insomnia . consequently ,
these patients receive inappropriate treatment , such as hypnotlcs , which can enhance the psychological distress and add to the adjustment difficulties that accompany crsds .
although a mutation of human period2 ( hper2 ) gene was identified in a large family with asps , other findings indicate genetic heterogeneity in this disorder . the exact mechanisms by which mutations in clock genes produce the physiological and behavioral phenotypes of crsds remain to be elaborated .
some findings demonstrate that a genetic origin might be present in crsds . in as many as 44% of patients with crsds
it is currently believed that crsds result from an abnormality of circadian timing system , which regulates the diurnal rhythms of an organism .
a clinical interview should evaluate the patient 's sleep - wake habits and presence of sleep complaints ( such as insomnia and daytime sleepiness ) .
