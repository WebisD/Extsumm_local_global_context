the two hemispheres of the human brain are not equivalent . relative functional differences between the left and the right side of the brain , so - called functional hemispheric asymmetries , have been observed for several cognitive functions ( corballis , 2009 ) .
in line with these scientific success stories , comparative neuroscience also allows for unique insights into ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes responsible for human brain lateralization . these insights , however , are only parts of the whole story and it becomes increasingly clear that we are still far away from having a complete understanding of the complex interactions of non - genetic and genetic factors that underlie the neurophysiological processes that drive human functional hemispheric asymmetries .
the idea of human exceptionalism had and still has a strong impact on lateralization research . only by abandoning this approach and viewing h. sapiens as one vertebrate species among many , we will be able to solve the riddle of functional hemispheric asymmetries in humans and other animals .
genetic and neuroscientific methods are rapidly advancing but we need to integrate the resulting insights into a broader comparative schema . to this end , it is fundamentally important to understand that human lateralization is not unique , but a trait that is shared with a multitude of other vertebrates .
