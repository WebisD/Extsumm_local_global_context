thus , we conducted the present study to analyze the long - term outcomes in a series of patients with tn who underwent single gkrs treatment and were followed up for a minimum of 60 months .
of the 7 patients with poor outcomes , 5 patients ( 22.7% ) experienced 50% improved pain with medication , and 2 ( 9.1% ) had no pain relief ( table 3 ) . subgroup analysis of excellent , good , and poor outcomes found 2 statistically significant factors related to achieving and maintaining complete pain relief : symptomatic periods before treatment ( p=0.035 ) and previous surgery ( p=0.008 ) .
6 patients ( 27.3% ) had good treatment outcomes ( represented by grades i and ii ) , and 7 patients ( 31.8% ) had poor treatment outcomes ( represented by grades iv and v ) during a median follow - up period of 92.2 months ( range 60 - 144 months )
the mean age was 61.5 years ( range 25 - 84 years ) , and the mean symptom duration from onset to treatment was 46.8 months ( range 1 - 84 months ) .
however , sex , age , pain distribution , and laterality of pain did not correlate with facial pain improvement ( table 4 ) . out of a total of 22 patients ,
