all three affected children developed a nonspecific central nervous system abnormality , but the clinical hallmark of the two brothers is early - onset lethal dcm . because early detection of this progressive dcm is essential for optimum management , further effort in investigating genotype - phenotype correlation in bmd should be encouraged .
among the entities that cause dilated cardiomyopathy in children are dystrophinopathies , including duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) , becker muscular dystrophy ( bmd ) , and x - linked dilated cardiomyopathy , allelic conditions caused by defects in dystrophin ( 1 ) .
they have a novel frameshift mutation in the dmd gene responsible for this unique clinical phenotype of bmd and severe early - onset dcm .
the importance of genetic screening of the male family members for early detection of lethal congestive heart failure ( chf ) will be discussed .
. there may be a fundamental difference in regulation of dmd gene transcription between skeletal and cardiac muscle . in this family ,
genotype - phenotype correlations for specific mutations in dystrophin related to predisposition to or protection against dcm have been proposed ( 6 , 11 ) , but exactly how this leads to dcm is poorly understood . here , we present a family in which two siblings and their nephew are affected by similar skeletal muscle abnormalities consistent with bmd .
