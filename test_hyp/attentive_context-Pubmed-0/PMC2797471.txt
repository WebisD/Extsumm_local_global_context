the last few years have seen a sharp increase in our understanding of ablation , maturation of the technology , an improvement in the safety profile , ablation efficacy and monitoring techniques and the publication of results in larger patient cohorts .
ablation will soon be sufficiently established to allow trials comparing ablation with conventional therapies in specific patient groups .
the last few years have seen a rapid expansion in the use and availability of ablation techniques with hundreds of papers published .
cryotherapy offers the opportunity to monitor the ice - ball with ultrasound ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
simultaneous use of multiple energy sources ( probes / electrodes ) is now available in all the different technologies .
improvements in guidance include the development of real - time co - registration techniques , most commonly ct and us .
radiofrequency ( rf ) remains the frontrunner in terms of cost , ease of set - up , versatility and flexibility but other techniques are catching up .
multiple renal tumours are not rare and can be difficult to resect without complications but complications are rare after ablation , particularly if a percutaneous approach is used .
