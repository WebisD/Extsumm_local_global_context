reiter 's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases of progressive myelopathy with multiple arthritis , urethritis , and skin lesions .
a previously healthy 36-year - old man presented with slowly progressive spastic paraparesis , impairment of vibration , and pain perception below the upper trunk associated with constipation , urinary difficulty , and sexual dysfunction .
first , the gastrointestinal symptoms that appeared before the development of cervical myelopathy might have reflected a preceding infection that initiated an autoimmune reaction , which led to myelitis and systemic inflammation . initial urinary tract infection and costochondral tenderness at the time of the first attack of myelitis might be indicative of reiter 's syndrome .
t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the spine showed a lesion with a high signal intensity and mild swelling that was not enhanced after the administration of contrast material in the cervical spinal cord ( fig .
second , despite the application of steroid pulse therapy , recurrences of progressive myelopathy associated with systemic symptoms of the skin and joints , and the positivity for hla - b27 suggest other causes of myelitis .
the association between reactive arthritis and   cervical myelopathy was not clear in this patient , but there were some features suggesting reiter 's syndrome as a cause of the myelitis .
