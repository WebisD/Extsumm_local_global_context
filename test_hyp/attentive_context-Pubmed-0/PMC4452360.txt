present study was designed to assess whether srage levels alter in prediabetes and correlate with ir and beta cell function in prediabetes and newly diagnosed t2 dm .
people with prediabetes suffer from increased risk of developing t2 dm in near future compared with people with normal glucose tolerance . in the present study we investigated the srage levels in prediabetes and the relationship of srage with ir and beta cell function in people with prediabetes and newly diagnosed t2 dm .
for further statistical analysis , we merged the people with prediabetes and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes together ( pd + dm group , n = 118 ) considering that both groups have similar underlying pathophysiological defects responsible for glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia .
future studies are therefore required to prospectively and serially measure srage levels in the same subjects who develop t2 dm from normoglycemia through prediabetes and to compare srage with the evolution of ir and beta cell dysfunction in those individuals . in summary , we concluded that srage levels do not change in prediabetes and do not show any relationship with ir and beta cell function in people with prediabetes and newly diagnosed t2 dm . these findings suggest that srage is unlikely to be an important predictor of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction during development of t2 dm .
