first , the model 
 has allowed for the rational design of a ligand that , when incubated 
 with the thousands of proteins expressed in a cancer cell , affinity 
 purified one , hsp70 .
in addition to 
 providing both a novel pharmacophore and medicinal 
 chemistry for its assembly , we describe in our papers a testing battery 
 for assessing hsp70-mediated mechanisms in cancer cells and for evaluating 
 specific ligand action in cancer cells through hsp70 inhibition .
third , the concordance in the observed biochemical and phenotypic 
 effects observed with these agents in cancer cells , such as exemplified 
 for 27c , suggests that , in the tested concentration range , 
 the biological activity of these agents is majorly and selectively 
 channeled through an hsp70-binding mechanism .
because of the appropriate fit , 
 and thus good enthalpy of binding of the irreversible inhibitors , 
 simple modifications such as replacement of the covalent linkage with 
 an ionic bridge ( yellow , figure 2b ) and filling 
 of the hydrophobic pocket occupied by methoxy in 1e with 
 a benzyloxy ( red , figure 2b ) have led to ligands 
 of reversible mode of binding that not only mimic the phenotype observed 
 with 1e , but do so with similar potency ( figure 4 ) .
