unadjusted and adjusted ors and 95% ci from logistic regressions predicting the likelihood of mets for each of the svr quintiles * adjusted ors take into consideration age , smoking , alcohol consumption , bmi , and menopausal status , hormone replacement therapy ( women only ) .
the prevalence of elevated fasting glucose , elevated triglycerides ( tgs ) , and reduced hdl cholesterol ( hdl - c ) significantly decreased as the svr quintile increased ( 26 , 16 , and 37% in quintile 1 vs. 5 , 4 , and 11% in quintile 5 , respectively ; all p for linear trend < 0.05 ) robust linear decreases in these risk factors were also seen among men ( supplementary table 1b ) .
ors of mets significantly decreased across all 5 quintiles of the svr after adjusting for covariates in both men ( or 1.0 for quintile 1 vs. 0.5 in quintile 5 ; 95% ci 0.30.7 for quintile 5 ; p for linear trend < 0.01 ) and women ( or 1.0 for quintile 1 vs. 0.2 in quintile 5 ; 95% ci 0.10.5 for quintile 5 ; p for linear trend < 0.01 ) ( table 1 ) .
