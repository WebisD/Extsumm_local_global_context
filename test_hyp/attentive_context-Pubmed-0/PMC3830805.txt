therefore , in the present study , we used snp data from the hapmap project to examine the evolution of the human abo blood group genes .
the modern human a allele emerged through a recombination between the b and o alleles , where the intact exon 6 from the b allele and two critical a type sites in exon 7 from the o allele were jointed less than 300,000 years ago . since the previous study   used a restricted dataset , that is , seattle snps project data , which is a set of 90 sequences in european- and african - americans , it is necessary to analyze a more comprehensive dataset to corroborate this hypothesis .
the enzyme encoded by functional alleles of type a and b transfer a galnac or a gal on the precursor oligosaccharides of type h. the nucleotide sequences of the human abo blood group genes have been previously determined and the molecular basis of these differences has been revealed   . the alleles a and b differ in exon 7 by four nonsynonymous mutations , and two of which are critical for the sugar specificity ( codons 266 and 268 encode l - g for a and m - a for b ) .
