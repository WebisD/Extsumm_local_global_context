this study was a case - control that was conducted in isfahan ; groups included 33 transurethral resection of the prostate ( turp ) patients ( group a ) and 33 patients who underwent open prostatectomy ( group b ) ; the cases were interviewed from 12 weeks to 12 months after undergoing surgery ( a total of 66 patients in case groups ) . a three - month lag to recruit the patients
in conclusion , it seems that prostatectomy , in both forms of open and transurethral , may cause onset of abdominal discomfort and bowel habit change that may resolve in time but significantly may induce bowel habit change in form of diarrheal symptoms .
the relative frequency of post - operative diarrhea was higher in group a ( patients underwent open prostatectomy ) than the group b ( patients underwent turp ) ( p = 0.026 , odd 's ratio = 0.30 ) .
ten patients in case groups ( group a and group b ) and 5 patients ( 8% ) in control groups ( group c and group d ) had ibs .
control groups data were compared separately with group a and group b. relative frequency of post - operative diarrhea in the patients who underwent open prostatectomy was higher than the control groups ( p = 0.034 , odd 's ratio = 3.06 ) .
