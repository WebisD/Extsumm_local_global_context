therefore , the present study was designed to evaluate the antioxidant effects of ace inhibitors with or without a sh group ( captopril and enalapril , respectively ) and to identify the involved mechanisms .
both captopril ( a sh - containing ace inhibitor ) and enalapril ( a non - sh - containing ace inhibitor ) protect endothelium against free radical injury in a dose - dependent manner in isolated rabbit abdominal aortas .
in the present study , both captopril and enalapril exerted an antioxidant effect against the electrolysis - induced ros in the rabbit aortic rings .
the relaxation rate of the detca+captopril group was significantly lower than the control ( captopril - only ) group after the ros attack ( 73.0%2.4% vs. 86.8%1.1% ; n=15 ; p<0.0001 ) ( fig .
the 10 , 310 , 10 , and 310 m enalapril - treated groups had relaxation rates of 1.8%1.2% , 10.0%2.1% , 73.9%5.7% , and 89.1%0.8% , respectively ( n , 13 to 15 ; anova and post test for linear trend ; both p<0.0001 ) .
after the equilibration period , the endothelium integrity was assessed by precontracting the aortic ring with 10 m of norepinephrine ( ne ) and a subsequent relaxation with cumulative concentrations ( 310 , 10 , 310 , and 10 m ) of acetylcholine ( ach ) .
