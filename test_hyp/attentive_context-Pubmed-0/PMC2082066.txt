we report here our clinical experience with both 16- and 64-detector row cta as the first and intended only diagnostic and treatment decision - making study for intracranial aneurysms in patients with acute sah .
it has been demonstrated that three - dimensional ct angiography ( 3d - cta ) can reliably detect intracranial aneurysms   . only after replacement of ia - dsa by cta
excluded from the study were 68 patients , of whom 24 were excluded because of a nonaneurysmal cause of the sah including trauma ( n  =  17 ) , arteriovenous malformation ( n  =  6 ) and anticoagulant therapy ( n  =  1 ) , 3 because of hypertension and intracerebral haematoma , 4 because of comorbidity or advanced age , 2 were excluded because of poor clinical condition and 1 because if poor clinical grading and advanced age , and 31 died from the initial effect of sah , rebleed or vasospasm with ischemia .
our primary aim was to assess whether cta is useful clinically in planning and performing clipping or coiling , especially in the acute phase in ruptured intracranial aneurysms , without recourse to ia - dsa .
repeat ia - dsa or cta should still be performed in patients with a nonperimesencephalic sah , due to false - negative ctas and ia - dsas in this patient group .
