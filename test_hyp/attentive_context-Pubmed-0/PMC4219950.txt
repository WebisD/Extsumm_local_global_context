several studies8,9,10,11,12 ) reported the pulmonary vasodilating therapy had an effective influence on fontan patients so we want to determine whether inhaled iloprost as a pulmonary vasodilator might have a role in the clinical symptoms , hemodynamics and exercise capacity of fontan patients .
an 18-year - old female with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum status post fontan surgery at age of three years complained of aggravated dyspnea on exertion ( doe ) .
although more advanced curable treatments of fontan physiology have not been developed , pulmonary vasodilator therapy on fontan circulation is one of good suggestion for symptomatic treatment of fontan failure and improvement of the cardiac output .
first case was considered fontan failure because of aggravated doe , functional class and pitting edema .
, we found that 12 weeks of iloprost therapy showed an association with improvement of clinical , hemodynamic parameters and exercise capacity in patients with fontan physiology .
unlike previous study using iloprost once , we used iloprost for three month period and positive results were achieved without major side effects . in addition , we found that iloprost was effective for fontan patients with or without symptoms .
despite the increased survival rate of patients who has congenital heart disease with single ventricular physiology due to advanced surgical technique , the fontan surgery is still a palliative procedure .
