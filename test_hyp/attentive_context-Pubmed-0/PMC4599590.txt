based on the lithofacies and the general geological setting , this system can be possibly related to an anastomosing river style .
sedimentological observations derived from outcrops around eirunep ( south - western part of the state of amazonia ) document various subenvironments of a fluvial system ( upper part of the solimes formation , late miocene ) . beside sandy channel deposits ,
the main part comprises overbank sediments of levees , crevasse splays / channels / deltas , abandoned channels , backswamps and floodplain paleosols .
conversely , we document a well - structured , aggrading fluvial system of late miocene age , which is in agreement with the sedimentation model and chronology proposed by latrubesse et  al .
wesselingh ( 2008 , p. 5 ) stated :  the lack of geological data has led to the emergence of many grand theories about the origin of present - day amazon system and its highly diversity , often based on dubious interpretations of the little data available  .
the present paper aims to contribute basic sedimentological data from a barely studied region ( eirunep , 2.000  km sw manaus ; fig . 
there is not any indication for a long - lived lake (  lake pebas  ) or any marine influx in this region during the late miocene .
