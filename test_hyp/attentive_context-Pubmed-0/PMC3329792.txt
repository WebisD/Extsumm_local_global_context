these reports have not yet been supported by data . after acquiring financial interest in an integrated prostate cancer center , we sought to evaluate whether our investment in imrt resulted in an increased utilization of radiation therapy in our patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer .
the number of patients treated with rp ( 67.81% versus 71.72% , p = 0.729 ) , as ( 9.59% versus 4.55% , p = 0.177 ) , adt ( 1.37% versus 2.02% , p = 0.999 ) , and bt ( 0.68% versus 1.01% , p = 0.999 ) were not significantly different between post- and pre - investment groups . while overall treatment trends afford succinct analysis , clinical decisions regarding treatment of pca are often driven by a multitude of patient - specific factors .
