improving our knowledge of the mechanism(s ) and of the regulation of ncr expression and function and integrating this information with inhibitory receptor expression and function will improve the prospective management of patients with potentially lethal or invalidating acute infections including influenza , dengue , or hcv and optimize treatment strategies of chronic invalidating persistent infections such as hiv , tb , and hcv .
so far , the role of ncrs in the interaction of pathogens with nk cells has been largely considered ancillary to cytokine- or tlr - mediated activation and to kir : hla modulation of nk cell function . over the last 10 years accumulating evidences point to the possibility of viruses to directly interact with ncrs to tamper with their expression and to interfere with ncr ligand expression on target cells , thus , indirectly reducing nk cell function irrespective of the kir  :  hla haplotype ( figure 2 ) .  
natural killer ( nk ) cells represent a highly specialized lymphoid population initially identified by a potent cytolytic activity against tumor or virus infected cells . different from t or b lymphocytes , they do not express clonally distributed receptors for antigen   ,   while their function is finely regulated by a balance of inhibitory and activating receptors .
