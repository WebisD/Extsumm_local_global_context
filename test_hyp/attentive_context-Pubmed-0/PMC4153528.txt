most aspects of quality of life in particular the emotional health and the amount of energy / fatigue in patients were reduced with the increase in the percentage of impairment ( wpi ) .
one of the cases assessed in this center is to determine the level of impairment among employed individuals following traumatic injuries during labor . given the possibility of examining and interviewing with these patients at this center , people referred to the center for determining their impairment in 2011 were examined and individuals with work - related upper extremity injury included in the study .
when the relationship between work experience of patients and their quality of life was assessed , only the patients social performance score showed a direct and weak correlation with their work experience ( p=0.016 , r=0.168 ) .
all patients were examined by a specialist in occupational medicine and the rate of their impairment was assessed based on the american medical association book ( ama ) and the whole person impairment ( wpi ) and the results were recorded ( 8) and those with no upper extremity impairment excluded . 
 
 in this cross - sectional study , after selecting patients , their demographic characteristics were recorded through asking questions from patients and studying their hospital records .
