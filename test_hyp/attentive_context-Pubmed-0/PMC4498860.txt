, we report a case in which aftv injection resulted in suppression of multiple - recurrent hcv - background hcc recurrence . in this case
, we detected a significant density of glypican-3 ( gpc3)-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) in the blood at 12  months after the last intradermal injection of aftv .
in patients with chronic hepatitis and in those with liver cirrhosis , detection of increasing incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) requires careful monitoring every 36  months using ultrasound sonography ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and frequent blood tests .
present results suggest that aftv should be taken in consideration as one of treatment modalities in cases involving potential hcc derived from chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis .
this is the first case we could identify gpc3-specific cellular immune response based on impure tumor antigenic formalin - fixed autologous hcc tissue .
the autologous formalin - fixed tumor vaccine ( aftv ) has been reported to reduce the recurrence risk of primary resected hepatitis b virus - background hcc by 81% 1 . in one case ,
recurrence of multiple - recurrent hepatitis c virus ( hcv)-back ground hcc was clearly suppressed long - term without any additional treatment 2 . here
