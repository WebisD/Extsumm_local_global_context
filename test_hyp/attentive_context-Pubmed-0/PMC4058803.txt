we conclude that this regimen in addition to reduction of immunosuppression may serve as a treatment option in patients with mild gcv - r cmv disease .
treatment of gcv - r cmv in solid organ transplant recipients is challenged by dose - limiting toxicities of effective agents and potential graft injury due to indirect viral effects or rejection associated with lowering of immunosuppressive agents . in our experience , 4 consecutive patients with documented ul97 mutations conferring resistance to gcv were successfully treated with a regimen of reduced - dose cidofovir and cmv - igg .
use of this regimen resulted in viral clearance , preservation of graft function , and avoidance of rejection in all four cases .
we chose to use cidofovir instead of foscarnet in these cases based on our own disappointing experience with the latter agent , having observed a high rate of acute renal failure requiring dialysis , in patients with severe gcv - r cmv disease .
viremia subsequently cleared again after 2 additional courses of cidofovir / cmv - igg in patient 1 and after 10 doses of cidofovir alone in patient 4 . in the latter patient ,
in all four patients , this regimen led to resolution of gcv - r disease without deterioration of renal function or rejection .
