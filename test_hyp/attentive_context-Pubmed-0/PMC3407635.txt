the objective of this study was to assess the associations of hours of tv viewing with dietary quality , obesity and physical activity for three ethnic minorities with and without type 2 diabetes .
there were no significant differences in physical activity levels and dietary practices between a lower - income sample of approximately equal numbers of white non - hispanics and aa with type 2 diabetes ( n = 196 ) and 75% of both groups did not meet the government recommendations for physical activity and about 50% of both groups reported following recommended dietary practices ( at that time was 30 minutes of exercise at least 3 times per week ) .
persons at risk for or having type 2 diabetes should be targeted for altering tv viewing habits in an effort to increase energy expenditure and reduce the influence of over - eating high - calorie , high - sodium , and high - fat - foods .
aa with and without diabetes with poorest diet quality ( lowest quartile of hei-05 ) were most likely to watch more than 4 hours of tv as compared to those with better diet quality .
aa with diabetes , more aa males were exercising regularly as compared to other race and gender groups . yet , aa men had the lowest met - minutes / week based on the international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) suggesting discordance with perceptions and performance of exercise .
