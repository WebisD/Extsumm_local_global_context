we report a long - term efficacy of nt-3 gene therapy on tr nerve pathology comparing single - stranded and self - complementary vectors , treatment duration , doses , and promoters .
the aav1 vector carrying the nt-3 gene can provide a continuous source of nt-3 serum levels following injection of skeletal muscle . in this study , we chose tr mouse model of cmt well - characterized histopathological phenotype and abnormal sc - axon interactions leading to profound alterations in the neurofilament ( nf ) cytoskeleton and impaired nerve regeneration .
the biological systemic effect of nt-3 is mediated through its continuous release from the muscle as illustrated with a long - lasting therapeutic serum nt-3 levels and functional , histopathological , and electrophysiological improvements observed not only in the vector - injected limb but also in the contralateral limb .
studies described here are the first preclinical studies to illustrate proof of principle in support of aav1.nt-3 gene therapy for sustained nt-3 delivery through secretion by muscle cells for the most common of the cmt neuropathies , cmt1a .
these studies utilized two experimental paradigms to show that nt-3 improved nerve function : ( i ) a xenograft model of grafted nerve segments from patients with a pmp22 duplication of cmt1a and ( ii ) studies in the tremblerj ( tr ) mouse , a naturally occurring animal model of cmt carrying a point mutation in the pmp22 gene .
