the aim of this study was to investigate whether taking a taurine and caffeine containing energy drink determines acute changes in myocardial function assessed by conventional echo - doppler analysis and by speckle tracking echocardiography ( ste ) , a new technique for assessing myocardial function .
in fact , the study of lv performance showed an increase of longitudinal function , with an increase of mapse and gls , and a remarkable enhancement of lv twisting ( figure 2 ) .
in addition to standard echo - doppler analysis , speckle tracking echocardiography ( ste ) was used in our study to assess cardiac deformation in three spatial directions : longitudinal , radial , and circumferential .
ste is a new technique for assessing myocardial function in physiological and pathological settings , and its feasibility and accuracy were tested in comparison with tagged magnetic resonance imaging , the gold standard to study myocardial deformation .
it has been proved that ste is able to detect initial ventricular dysfunction in hypertension , diabetes , valvular heart disease , and heart failure , with high sensitivity in analyzing minimal change in myocardial deformation   .   in our study population of 35 young healthy subjects , taking an ed containing sugar , caffeine ( 0.03% ) , and taurine ( 0.4% ) showed a significant change of myocardial function of both lv and rv one hour after drinking it , suggesting a possible positive effect on cardiac inotropism .
