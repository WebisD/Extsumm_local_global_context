the authors studied plasma pge2 assay to determine relationship between the plasma pge2 and chronic active hepatitis .
the mean plasma pge2 level was 9.070.89 pg / ml in 15 patients with chronic active hepatitis and was significantly higher than that of the control group ( p<0.01 ) ( table 3 ) .
the above results suggest that plasma pge2 can be used for the measurement of cell - mediated immunity and follow - up study in patients with chronic active hepatitis and hepatitis b carriers .
the study group consisted of the patients with chronic active hepatitis and hepatitis b virus carriers who had been hospitalized or visited the internal medicine department , chonbuk national university hospital from jun .
this fact suggest that plasma pge2 level has a close reversed relationship with cmi . because we do nt have a specific methods to predict the prognosis of chronic active hepatitis , plasma pge2 level will be helpful in evaluating the prognosis of hepatitis patient .
the results were that the plasma pge2 level in patients with chronic active hepatitis is significantly higher than that of the control group .
the mean plasma pge2 level was 4.65  1.59 pg / ml in 8 patients in the recuperative stage or stable stage of chronic hepatitis and tended to decrease . however , this decrease was significantly different from the control group ( table 4 ) .
