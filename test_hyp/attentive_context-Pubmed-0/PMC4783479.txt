the purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictability of vertebral deformity types and prognosis using early bone marrow edema pattern of ovcf on t1wi .
in addition , vertebral osteonecrosis and spinal stenosis on the follow up mri were more frequent in patients with diffuse low si type .
in conclusion , early bone marrow edema pattern of ovcf on t1wi , significant correlated with vertebral deformity types on the follow up mri ( p<0.001 ) .
poor prognostic factors such as higher rates of vertebral body height loss , crush deformity and severe degree vertebral body height loss ( height reduction more than 40% ) on the follow up mri were more frequent in patients with diffuse low si type according to the early bone marrow edema pattern on t1wi .
therefore the diffuse low si type according to the early bone marrow edema pattern on t1wi can be considered as one of the poor prognostic factors for the acute ovcfs .
the patients with ovcf that have > 40% loss of vertebral height loss , or > 30 degrees of kyphosis often can be treated with surgical intervention15 ) .
from may 2009 to january 2013 , 234 patients with thoracolumbar vcf , who underwent lumbar spine mri were retrospectively reviewed .
