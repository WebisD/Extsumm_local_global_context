a 68-year - old , otherwise healthy female presented with a sudden , temporary loss of vision in her left eye , which occurred 1 day prior to the encounter .
endarterectomy has been proven to effectively limit future embolic events and restore blood flow to the affected areas.911 this case shows that successful identification and treatment of this disease is of paramount importance and can prevent future damage to visual and cerebral function , even when a rare anomaly such as a right - sided aortic arch is identified in the patient .
her ocular history included an uncomplicated cataract extraction in both eyes 2 years prior and dry eyes .
first , this patient displayed a previously undiagnosed congenital defect with a right - sided aorta .
the loss of vision lasted for ~1 minute , which occurred while she was reading a book using reading glasses .
the second abnormality was a common origin of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries with a tortuous common carotid artery .
because of these findings , we strongly recommend formal vascular imaging with ct angiography of chest , neck , and head as an initial examination to be followed by vascular surgical consultation .
