this model represents a novel research tool for the examination of lung transplantation and the advancement of clinical lung transplants .
this suggests the role of minor , and not major , histocompatibility antigens in obliterative bronchiolitis pathogenesis .
this makes left - single lung transplantation feasible in the murine model without the need for a circulatory support system .
one limitation of the orthotopic left lung transplant in the murine model is that recipient animals can survive after alloimmune - mediated necrosis of their allografts .
our preliminary surgeries revealed that ventilation and perfusion of the transplanted lung was highly dependent on the size of pv anastomosis .
introduction of the cuff technique has allowed for the widespread use of the orthotopic lung transplantation in rats .
orthotopic lung transplantation in mice is challenging due to microsurgical demands and extreme fragility of tissues .
this became the basis for the development of the orthotopic lung transplant model in mice in our lab . in mice and rats , unlike humans , the left lung contains only one lobe and makes up only 25% of the total lung mass .
inappropriate cuff sizing resulted in either atelectasis of the transplanted lung or dehiscence of the pv anastomosis .
