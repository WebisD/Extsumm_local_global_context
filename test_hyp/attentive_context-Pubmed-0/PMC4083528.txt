herein , we report five cases of ton in which a modified surgical procedure for endoscopic optic nerve decompression was performed , using a 45 endoscope . we include discussion of the operative events , along with the apparent advantages and limitations .
our study demonstrates that a modified trans - sphenoidal optic nerve decompression is a feasible , safe , effective , and minimally invasive approach for ton patients with high sphenoidal pneumatisation and without supersphenoid - ethmoid cellulae . in cases of high sphenoidal pneumatisation
, the use of an angled endoscope allows for easy access to the optic nerve canal and the orbit apex using a trans - sphenoidal approach while keeping the uncinate process and anterior ethmoidal sinus intact .
five patients with ton , all of whom were unresponsive to high - dose methylprednisolone ( 500 mg / day ) for more than 7 days , were enrolled to undergo modified endoscopic optic nerve decompression .
in this study , we successfully developed a modified endoscopic optic nerve decompression procedure for five patients with ton with severe sphenoidal pneumatisation and without onodi cellulae .
traumatic optic neuropathy ( ton ) is an impact injury to the optic nerve , usually secondary to blunt head trauma , resulting in partial or complete loss of vision .
