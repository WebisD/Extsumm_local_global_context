correlation of this expression with intensity of early neurodegeneration detected in the brain during the et-1 induced model of stroke was also analyzed .
although in our study the expression of several studied chemokines was significantly increased at the early phase of et-1 induced stroke model , no clear correlation of this expression with neurodegeneration was observed .
that they suggest that inhibition of inflammatory cell accumulation in the brain at the early stage of stroke may lead to amelioration of ischemic neurodegeneration .
upregulated in the ischemic brain chemokines may be a potential target for future therapies reducing inflammatory cell migration to the brain in early stroke .
after microinjection of et-1 into selected brain regions they observed using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) an acute reduction of local perfusion in the injected hemisphere , loss of neurons in the grey matter and a macrophage / microglia and astrocyte response .
we observed almost 46-fold and 30-fold increase in ccl5 expression at 24  h and 72  h , respectively , after induction of et-1 induced stroke model .
in this study we analyzed potential relationship between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in experimental model of ischemic stroke induced by intracerebral et-1 injection .
