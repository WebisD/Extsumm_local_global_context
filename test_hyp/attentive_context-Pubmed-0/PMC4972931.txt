tilt test can be used as an add - on in diagnosis of orthostatic syndromes .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to analyze the cerebral blood flow and cardiovascular patterns in common orthostatic syndromes .
patients with pcaf had reduced cbfv in the supine position , had elevated cerebral vascular resistance in supine position and during the tilt , and had abnormal drop of cbfv score during the tilt ( table 2 ) . 

all three types of syncope share common pattern in cbfv which is consistent with cerebral vasodilation ( figures 3 and 811 ) .
this is in contrast with a recent study   which observed elevated heart rate and blood pressure before and during the loss of consciousness . in this study no particular heart rate and blood pressure pattern
tilt test showed normal responses in 4 subjects , pots in 2 subjects , and oh - compensated and mixed syncope in 1 subject .
then the diagnostic utility of the tilt test has been expanded for diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension , autonomic failure , postural tachycardia syndrome , and other forms of orthostatic intolerance .
vasomotor oscillations ( figure 19 ) , spurious fluctuations of blood pressure ( figure 20 ) , and sustained drift in blood pressure ( figure 21 ) obtained from finger plethysmographic device can be recognized by simultaneous recording of the arm blood pressure and cbfv .
