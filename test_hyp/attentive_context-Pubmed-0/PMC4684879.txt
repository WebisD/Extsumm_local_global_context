accordingly , we used a spared nerve injury ( sni ) model to evaluate the role of mtor in the rvm in neuropathic pain in rats .
in the current study , we provide the first demonstration of the following : ( 1 ) mtor is expressed in the rvm region and can be activated in nerve injury - induced neuropathic pain ; ( 2 ) this mtor is largely expressed in 5-htergic neurons , which mainly comprise the descending pain control pathway ; ( 3 ) inhibition of the activated mtor restores the overexcitability of the 5-htergic neurons to normal ; and ( 4 ) inactivation of mtor by intra - rvm rapamycin microinjection alleviates established hyperalgesia ( abolished at the maintenance stage of neuropathic pain ) rather than influencing the beginning priming ( induction stage ) of neuropathic pain .
through the deactivation of 5-htergic spinally projecting neurons in the rvm and thus the weakening of descending pain facilitation , specific targeting of the activation of mtor in the rvm is a promising avenue for the management of neuropathic pain .
recently , by taking advantage of optogenetic methods , optogenetic stimulation in tph2-channelrhodopsin 2 ( chr2 ) transgenic mice was shown to decrease both mechanical and thermal pain thresholds .
