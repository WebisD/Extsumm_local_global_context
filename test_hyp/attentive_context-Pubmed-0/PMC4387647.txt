comparison of the bacterial effect ( immediate and 3 h ) of the three surgical alcohol - based hand rubs after 3 h , the bacterial density of hands increased , but these counts ( 3 h post - value ) were significantly lower than the pre - value : sterillium : 3.92  0.63 and 1.80  1.14 , decosept : 3.86  1.44 and 1.94  1.10 , and septicidine : 3.98  1.02 and 1.58  1.23 ( t - test ; p < 0.0001 ) .
based on the results of the study , although decosept and septicidine had significant effect on skin flora , considering the factors that influence the antibacterial efficacy of alcohol - based hand rub ( type , concentration , applied volume , and duration of contact with antiseptic ) , sterillium was the best product .
the pre - value and immediate post - value log10 of the three products were : sterillium : 4.3  0.44 and 0.32  0.57 , decosept : 4.07  0.53 and 0.81  0.84 , and septicidine : 3.95  0.94 and 1.28  1.14 , respectively .
the alcohol concentrations of sterillium , septicidine and decosept are 75 , 75 and 66.6 percent respectively , that their concentrations were in range of effective alcohol concentration . in a study ,
