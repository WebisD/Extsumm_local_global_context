multiple authors strongly recommend not exceeding a 7 mm recession on medial rectus and 8 mm recession on lateral rectus muscle to avoid diminished restricted ocular movements.2123 in this study only two ( 13.4% ) subjects in group 2 , who underwent a 10 mm recession on lateral rectus muscle suffered postoperative limitation in ocular movements .
this is a retrospective clinical analysis conducted on the patients of both sexes with horizontal strabismus presenting for the first time from june 2004 to december 2007 .
similarly , in group 2 ( exotropia ) , patients presented with orthophoria ( 73.3% ) , while four ( 26.7% ) patients demonstrated residual deviation .
the worldwide incidence of strabismus varies from 3% to 5%,1,2 whereas hu and colleagues3 identified strabismus in 2% to 4% of white populations , and abrahamsson and colleagues4 reported strabismus in 0.6% of asians3 and africans.5 in a study conducted by dana and colleagues5 in sydney , the incidence of strabismus was established in 48 patients ( 2.8% of total population ) . in another study carried out by donnelly and colleagues , the prevalence was 3.98%.6 in an analysis conducted amongst afghan immigrants in pakistan , strabismus was noticed in 1.4% of patients.7 another study conducted at peshawar in 2004 confirmed that the total frequency of squint was 2%.8 the clinical treatment of squint includes evaluation and correction of multiple errors of refraction , management of amblyopia , and surgical treatment .
