although pgls are involved in the hypervirulence of the pgl - producing strains , they are not a unique characteristic of the w - beijing family
the intact pks15/1 has been shown to be responsible for the production of phenolic glycolipids and is seemingly found in m. tuberculosis w - beijing family , but it was not found in m. tuberculosis cdc1551 and h37rv ( 8) .
our results showed that the 7-bp insertion of the pks15/1 was not only present in the w - beijing family but also in other m. tuberculosis genotypes .
previous studies suggested that pgls produced by the m. tuberculosis w - beijing family were associated with the hypervirulent phenotype by inhibiting the innate immune response ( 6,7 ) .
one hundred forty - seven clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis were obtained from the molecular mycobacteriology laboratory , department of microbiology , faculty of medicine , siriraj hospital , mahidol university , thailand , and the t-2 project from 1997 to 2001 ( table ) .
the intact pks15/1 has also been shown to be nonpolymorphic in the w - beijing family ; it was found in all 102 w - beijing strains tested ( 15 ) . from this observation
