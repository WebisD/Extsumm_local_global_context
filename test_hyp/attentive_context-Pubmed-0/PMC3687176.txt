we intend to report the case of a patient who underwent tonsillectomy for diagnostic purposes because of an epidermoid cyst arising from the tonsil and confirmed by histology .
a 42-year - old female came to our clinic for sore throat and difficulty in swallowing .
epidermoid cysts , a rare occurrence in the head and neck area , can also be found inside the palatine tonsils and cause asymmetrical hypertrophy .
surgical excision is sufficient for cure . even though reports of epidermoid cysts in the head and neck , especially those in the floor of the mouth , soft palate , lips , or the lingual and buccal epithelium can be found in the literature , but there is no report of an intratonsillar epidermoid cyst .
ent examination showed marked hypertrophy of the right tonsil in comparison with the contralateral one , and a smooth - surfaced mass near the upper pole of the tonsil [ figure 1 ] .
a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) examination was performed , which evidenced a protrusion of the clearly hypertrophic tonsil into the nasopharynx [ figure 2 ] .
epidermoid and dermoid cysts are benign lesions developing from abnormal epithelial components of ectodermal tissue formed during the fetal period , or implanted epithelium arising after trauma or surgery .
