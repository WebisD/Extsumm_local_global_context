our findings emphasize the role of using well - defined clinical materials in studies on bacterial pathogenicity and severity of human disease .
in general , complement - mediated killing of serum - susceptible isolates plays a major role in restricting access of pathogens to the bloodstream . however , available information about possible serum sensitivity of c. jejuni isolates from blood is scarce ( 8,9 ) . in our study of nonselected c. jejuni isolates from blood , susceptibility to human serum varied according to mlst cc . in conclusion , in this nationwide study during a 10-year period in finland , we found by mlst analysis that half of the bacteremia isolates of c. jejuni clustered within an otherwise uncommon st-677 cc . whether this finding indicates special adaptation of st-677 cc to finland or to the human bloodstream
we characterized a unique collection of 73 c. jejuni isolates from blood obtained during a nationwide study in finland over a 10-year period . despite the high population diversity of c. jejuni , nearly half of the isolates from blood showed clustering within the st-677 cc , a rare cc in other countries ( 12,13 ) .
further studies are needed to clarify whether bacterial characteristics might explain this finding . in our previous study , which included human fecal c. jejuni isolates obtained in finland from the mid-1990s through 2007 ,
