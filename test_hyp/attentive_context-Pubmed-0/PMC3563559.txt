the foundation of european tissue banks initiated a survey to obtain an assessment and quantification of the situation in the field of cardiovascular tissue banks , after implementation of the european directives into national legislation .
in 2011 , questionnaires were sent out to 30 cardiovascular tissue banks , 18 of which completed and returned them .
as there are very large methodological differences with respect to microbiology testing , incubation and decontamination of cardiovascular tissue between the 17 contributing tissue banks , there is a necessity to validate procedures and room for improvement .
for the first time since the start of the clinical use of human allogeneic heart valves , data from a number of european cardiovascular tissue banks could be accumulated .  
first of all , looking at the number of tissue grafts issued for transplantation , one can conclude that the demand for tissues has not decreased during the period of 4 years encompassed in this study . apparently the demand
the differences in accepted time lapses from death to cardiectomy , and from cardiectomy until excision of the valves and further processing find their origin in view - points with respect to quality and safety . a consensus between the tissue banks contributing to this study should be based on data with respect to the potential loss of tissue quality starting at cardiac arrest and measured over time .
