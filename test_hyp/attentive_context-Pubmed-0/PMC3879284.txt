 odi , u1-npog , overjet , and u1-upper lip were found to be the discriminants for classifying the female adult subjects with class i or ii molar relationships into the no - strain or strain group , and the prediction rate of these variables for the group classification was 81.8%.in the cart model , u1-npog was the most predictive variable for categorizing the subjects into the no - strain or strain group , with a cut - off value of 14.2 mm.the subjects in the strain group showed a retruded mandible , vertical skeletal pattern , convex profile , and protruded dentoalveolar pattern compared with those in the no - strain group .
