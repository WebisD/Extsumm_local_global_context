however , musculoskeletal ultrasound is one of the most practical because it is rapid , safe , relatively inexpensive , emits no ionizing radiation , and can be performed in the outpatient clinical setting.11,12 ultrasound utilizes high - frequency sound waves to visualize soft tissues and bony structures and is a frequently used imaging modality to diagnose musculoskeletal pathology or to aid with needle guidance during interventional procedures . importantly , unlike fluoroscopy , ultrasound allows identification of vascular and nervous structures as well as demonstrating needle movement in real time to aid in needle positioning without the use of contrast medium.13 the purpose of this review was to determine the effect of ultrasound guidance on the accuracy of needle placement , clinical outcomes , and cost - effectiveness in comparison with anatomical landmark - guided intra - articular large joint injections , with particular emphasis on the knee .
overall , the use of imaging guidance , in particular ultrasound , improves the accuracy of intra - articular injection in large joints , including the knee .
all studies of large joints ( ie , knee , hip , and shoulder ) utilizing any imaging modality to aid with needle placement were analyzed .
