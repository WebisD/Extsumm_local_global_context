herein , we evaluated the hpv dna detection agreement between self and 
 clinician - collected samples .
a total of 30% ( 51/170 ) of the 
 samples were hpv dna - positive .
use of the self - collected sampling method as a primary 
 prevention strategy in countries with few resources could effectively identify those 
 women with hr - hpv .
