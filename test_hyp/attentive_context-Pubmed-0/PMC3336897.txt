it is estimated that 6~8% of the children , and 4% of the adult have immunoglobulin ( ig ) e - mediated hypersensitivity to food ag .
research in the area of food allergy has advanced rapidly in recent years . however , the etiology and pathogenesis of food allergy are not fully understood .
the intact protein antigens absorption into the intestinal tissue is regarded to be a prerequisite in the development of intestinal sensitization .
it is still unknown about how hapten exposure on different epithelial surfaces such as the intestine , and the role of hapten in the pathogenesis of food allergy .
the t cells of t - helper ( th)2 phenotype are known to be involved in the development of allergic disease .
the  hygiene hypothesis  postulates that limited exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens during early childhood results in an insufficient stimulation of t helper ( th)1 cells , which in turn can not counterbalance the expansion of th2 cells and results in a predisposition to allergy . while yielded conflicting results also raising the possibility that this model may be something of an over simplification .
oral antigen dose also seems important in determining which of two distinct effector mechanisms mediates the development of tolerance . in animal models ,
