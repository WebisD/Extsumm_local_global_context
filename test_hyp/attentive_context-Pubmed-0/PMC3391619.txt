it has been reported that cmt symptoms progress due to axonal degeneration and loss,5,19 with axonal loss being the major cause of impairment and disability in patients with cmt1a.20 the accentuation of muscle wasting and sensory impairment in the distal extremities was correlated with the corresponding reduction in the cmaps and snaps but not with the decrease in mncv or sncv.10 - 12 our results support the hypothesis that the disease - related disabilities are correlated with the decreased nerve action potentials rather than the conduction velocities .
charcot - marie - tooth disease ( cmt ) is the most common hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy , and cmt type 1a ( cmt1a ) neuropathy , which is the most common type of cmt , is subject to a gene dosage effect.1 the primary genetic cause of cmt1a is a duplication of pmp22 resulting from the unequal crossover between two homologous repetitive elements that flank the 1.4-mb region of chromosome 17p12.2 a new mechanism responsible for the outbreak of cmt1a - which is related to a nonrecurrent rearrangement has recently been reported.3 cmt1a is also caused by a point mutation in pmp22.4 abnormal axon - schwann cell interactions cause abnormalities in axonal structure and function , but the exact pathogenic mechanism causing cmt1a is unknown.5 one obvious possibility is that the weakness and sensory loss are the result of axonal degeneration ; secondary axonal degeneration is common in cmt1a patients , and its degree determines the patient 's functional disability.6 this finding is consistent with the electrophysiological and clinical findings in patients with cmt1a and in several animal models of demyelinating neuropathy.7,8 axonal dysfunction induced by demyelinating schwann cells can also occur without axonal degeneration.9 the relationship between motor nerve conduction velocities ( mncvs ) and disease disabilities has been the subject of much debate.10 - 14 most cmt1a research groups have found a relatively weak correlation between the severity of muscle weakness and nerve conduction velocities,10 - 12 although some have noted that patients with slower velocities developed more weakness.13,14 moreover , longitudinal studies have shown that the velocities remained unchanged over decades , whereas the compound muscle action potential ( cmap ) amplitudes decreased.15,16 however , the relationship between mncvs , cmaps , and the disease severity has not been investigated in koreans .
