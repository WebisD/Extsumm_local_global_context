in subgroup analysis among patients with a larger tumor size ( > 5 cm ) , microvascular invasion , intrahepatic metastasis , higher ajcc t - stage , and higher blcl stage , high mitotic index showed unfavorable influences on dss ( p=0.001 , p=0.008 , p=0.003 , p=0.012 , and p < 0.001 , respectively ) ( fig .
our data show , for the first time , that high mitotic index is an independent predictor of shorter dss in surgically resected hccs .
high mitotic index showed significant association with younger age ( p < 0.001 ) , larger tumor size ( p=0.022 ) , higher edmondson grade ( p < 0.001 ) , microvascular invasion ( p < 0.001 ) , major portal vein invasion ( p=0.026 ) , intrahepatic metastasis ( p < 0.001 ) , higher afp level ( p < 0.001 ) , hepatitis b virus etiology ( p=0.012 ) , and liver cirrhosis ( p=0.016 ) . as the ajcc t - stage or bclc stage increased , the frequency of high mitotic index also showed a significant increase ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) .
, we evaluated mitotic index as a possible prognostic marker in a large cohort of 282 patients with primary hcc who received long - term follow - up for 120 months .
