however , levels began to decrease continuously afterward and decreased to 1.922.26 ng / ml in 3 months ( p<0.001 ) and 1.791.82 ng / ml in 6 months ( p<0.001 ) .
within 12 months , the serum psa level was 1.702.25 ng / ml ( p<0.001 ) , thus demonstrating a decreasing pattern of stabilization ( table 2 , fig .
1 ) . the serum psa level at 24 months after the operation was not checked in all patients , but it also was shown to decrease and stabilize ( table 2 ) . as a result ,
the mean serum psa value was 2.722.93 ng / ml , and mean prostate volume estimated by trus was 35.715.5 cc ( table 1 ) . the serum psa level temporarily increased and reached 3.183.23 ng / ml at 1 month after the operation ( p=0.032 ) .
the serum psa level may be temporarily increased after ktp laser vaporization for a certain period of time , but values will show a decreasing pattern within 3 months and will eventually become stabilized between 6 and 12 months .
a total of 662 patients underwent ktp laser vaporization of the prostate for bph between october 2004 and august 2008 . among these patients , those with prostate cancer , prostatitis , a history of urinary retention , or use of antiandrogen medication , all of which can influence serum psa levels ,
