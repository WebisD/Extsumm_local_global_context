specifically , this paper will survey available information on structure and function of different domains of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 and their interaction with inhibitors .
recent advances , including the sequencing of plasmodium genomes ( http://www.plasmodb.org/ ) and development of new tools for manipulating plasmodium genes , have improved our understanding of the cysteine proteases of parasites .
the understanding of the cysteine proteases of malaria parasites has increased markedly in recent years . since cysteine proteases that play an important role in the parasite life cycle by degrading erythrocyte proteins , most notably hemoglobin , are attractive targets for antimalarial chemotherapy . falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are the best characterized cysteine proteases of malaria parasite , the structure and function of different domains and their interaction with small and macromolecular inhibitors are studied
structure - guided approaches should have great role in the design of potent and highly selective inhibitor .
. the structure - function study of falcipains and interaction with inhibitors will provide detail insights to develop rational design of inhibitor against falcipains .
therefore , given the importance of the cysteine proteases , this paper will focus on structural - functional relationship of falcipains , major cysteine proteases of p. falciparum .   in cases of malaria ,
