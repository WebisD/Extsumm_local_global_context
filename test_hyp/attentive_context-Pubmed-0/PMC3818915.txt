therefore , this study investigated gender differences in body composition , systemic levels of adipokines and inflammatory markers , and aerobic fitness in a cohort of healthy qatari adults matched for age and body mass index ( bmi ) .
were not associated with any of the metabolic markers studied , whereas in women , adiponectin was negatively correlated with triglycerides ( r = 0.45 , p = 0.02 ) and insulin ( r = 0.39 , p = 0.05 ) . in both men and women ,
il-6 , leptin , and crp were strongly correlated with waist circumference and systolic bp only in men ( table 3 ) .
the accumulation of omental adipose tissue , combined with extremely low aerobic fitness , in arab women may abrogate the protective effect of adiponectin , leading to a greater risk of developing mes .
women had significantly lower levels of triglycerides ( p < 0.01 ) and ldl ( p = 0.05 ) and higher levels of hdl ( p < 0.01 ) , compared to men .
adiposity was also significantly higher in women than men in the heart intra- ( p = 0.04 ) and overall heart ( p < 0.01 ) regions , as well as in the thigh region ( p < 0.01 ) .
