further , data on appropriate management after cied removal are also not available , although management of arrhythmic support after cied removal is needed until a new cied is implanted . in the present review ,
patients dependence on pacemakers , the risk of tachyarrhythmia , and requirement of crt must be determined , and the strategy for antiarrhythmic management should be determined on the basis of these investigations .
various tools ( traction devices , mechanical sheaths , laser sheaths , electrosurgical sheaths , rotating threaded tip sheath , and telescoping sheaths ) and methods ( femoral approach , internal jugular approach , and a hybrid method with both , transvenous and surgical methods ) have been developed for lead removal , and favorable results have been reported , .
cardiac implantable electronic devices ( cieds ) have become increasingly important in cardiac disease management worldwide .
however , data to determine the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for cied infection are limited .
in fact , pacemakers , implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( icds ) , and cardiac resynchronization therapy ( crt ) have been used and developed since the 1960s . with the increase in the number of patients with cieds ,
