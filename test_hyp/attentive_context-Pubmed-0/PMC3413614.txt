the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology ( strobe ) , the meta - analysis of observational studies in epidemiology ( moose ) , and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analysis ( prisma ) guidelines were used by two reviewers ( mp and jh ) to assess the quality of the included studies ( 1517 ) .
furthermore , organizations such as siog and nccn that advocate for some form of geriatric assessment should articulate more clearly the current state of knowledge with regard to the benefits and impact of geriatric assessment on specific outcomes along with highlighting the current large gap in evidence .
, such screening tools will only be of value once randomized controlled trials have clearly demonstrated that resource - intensive comprehensive geriatric assessment is effective in improving outcomes compared with usual care in the oncology setting .
this is the first review , to our knowledge , to systematically summarize all available evidence with regard to the use and effectiveness of geriatric assessment in the oncology setting .
a study was eligible for inclusion if it : 1 ) reported on older patients ( mean or median age of study participants 65 years or older ) who were diagnosed with cancer ( any type of cancer , including hematological malignancies ) and being seen in oncology clinics ( outpatient oncology or hematology clinics or inpatient oncology or hematology units ) ; 2 ) reported on cross - sectional , longitudinal , observational , or interventional studies that either assessed the feasibility of the use of tools or instruments or the effectiveness of geriatric assessment tools on any of the aforementioned outcome measures ; and 3 ) was written in english , french , dutch , or german .
