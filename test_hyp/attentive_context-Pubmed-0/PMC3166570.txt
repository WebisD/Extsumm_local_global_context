a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease may lead to improved outcomes in patients with pcp identifying more efficient and more specific immunomodulation therapies .
the host 's immune response is one of the main pathogenic determinants of lung injury during pcp   and involves the interactions between immune cells and soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines .
is termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( iris ) .   in murine models of iris ,
the extensive interaction between the immune response and pneumocystis organisms suggests that specific immune modulation could be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat pcp patients .
cd4 t cells are most abundant during the acute stage of disease that coincides with the development of impaired pulmonary physiology and organism clearance . the severity of iris is closely related to the extent of cd4 t cell recovery , and these cells
research to date on host immune responses to pneumocystis infection has revealed some aspects of the mechanisms utilized by immune cells that contribute to the pathogenesis of pcp - associated lung injury .
it is critical for the host defense against pneumocystis , but it also plays an important role in pcp - related lung injury through the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells that amplify pulmonary inflammation and lung damage   .
