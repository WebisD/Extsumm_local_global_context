thus , we examined the intrahepatic t cell response in terms of cytokines , cytokine receptors , and adhesion molecules in a patient under ifn-/ribavirin treatment and who remained persistently infected > 18 years .
evidence of regulatory t cells installation in the liver of a chronically infected patient with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) suggests a key role for these cells in the aggravation of the liver pathology and could potentially represent a predictive factor of liver damage aggravation .
moreover , the opportunity of studying three histologically well - defined liver biopsies of an hcv genotype 1b infected patient followed from the chronic infection to the hcc allowed us to investigate the tr1 cells infiltration within these liver biospies .
as the lymphotropism of hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) has already been ascertained , and in the light of the fact that the immune defense system is an organized network composed of functionally immune cells , this study was carried out to verify the possible involvement of tr1 cells in the progression of hcv - related chronic hepatitis . in this study
the increase of tr1 cells , which suppressed protective th1 responses via their high production of il-10 , could explain the failure of the ifn treatment observed for this patient . in a more general way , the implication of tr1 in viral persistence and associated hepatic pathologies could have significant implications for our understanding of the role of t cells in immunity to infectious diseases and for the development of new therapies for the control of immune - mediated disorders .
