there has been a surge of interest in the various msc formulations commercially 
 available for clinical use in spinal surgery .
allogeneic msc therapy for spine fusion and other skeletal treatments is still in its 
 infancy .
therefore , it is imperative that the 
 spine surgery community carefully evaluate the use of msc in spine fusion through 
 well - designed and executed studies . although more than a decade of preclinical animal 
 research that has shown promising results , the safety and efficacy of these products in 
 randomized controlled trials must be ascertained . with the rapidly growing number of spine 
 fusion surgeries performed annually , further study into fusion - enhancing compounds becomes 
 increasingly necessary .
flow 
 cytometry experiments have shown that mscs express intermediate levels of hla class i and 
 little to no hla class ii or costimulatory molecules ( e.g. , cd40).11 
 36 neither undifferentiated nor differentiated major 
 histocompatibility complexes elicit lymphocyte proliferation when transplanted,36 
 37 and in fact , they tend to alter the cytokine profile to 
 an anti - inflammatory state by decreasing tumor necrosis factor- and interferon - gamma and 
 increasing interleukin-10 , interleukin-4 , and regulatory t cells.38 mscs have even been used for their immunosuppressive actions in treating acute 
 graft - versus - host disease.39 for these reasons , 
 host - versus - graft disease , or graft rejection , does not appear to be a problem with msc use 
 in spine fusion . the use of msc therapy in bone regeneration has been and is currently investigated both in 
 animal models and in the clinical setting . this is being done through both local 
 implantation of the stem cells and via gene therapy , as well as through autologous transfer 
 of engineered extracted mscs .
