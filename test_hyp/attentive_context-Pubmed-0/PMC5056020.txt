expression of mage-1 was significantly associated with tumor size ( p = 0.018 ) and lymph node ( p = 0.042 ) breast cancers .
although the exact biological function of ctas is still unknown , future studies will hopefully allow more insights into the activities of ctas in tumor cells on the molecular level . in conclusion , due to mage-1 expression ( score  2 + ) in about 30% of our patients , even more frequent than her2 positivity in breast cancer
the purpose of the present study is to assess immunohistochemical expression of cta mage-1 in tissue samples of invasive breast cancer and its correlation with known prognostic factors .
expression of mage-1 was significantly associated with lymph node ( p = 0.003 ) breast cancers , but no association was found between mage-1 cytoplasmic expression and tumor size , age , her-2 status , tumor stage , grade , and er/ pr status .
a total of 113 patients with invasive breast cancer ( 112 ductal and one lobular ) were included .
a , strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of most of neoplastic cells ( h & e , 100  ) ; b , strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of most of neoplastic cells ( h & e , 100  ) .
