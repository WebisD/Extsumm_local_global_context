it is essential that trauma providers be au - fait with the principles of damage control for they are clearly life - saving in many patients with multisystem trauma .
, damage control principles are also applied for non - trauma care , including the treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome and intra - abdominal sepsis .
the damage control concept originated over 100 years ago , and has since grown to encompass all phases of the initial care of the severely injured patient . by learning from the accumulated experience , outcomes and complications of damage control , modern surgeons can apply this strategy following a rationalized approach . nowadays
described the development of the  vicious cycle  of hypothermia , coagulopathy , and acidosis in major abdominal vascular injuries [ figure 1 ] .
damage control is a fundamental shift from the traditional surgical focus of anatomical restoration to that of physiological restoration .
the most pervasive concept in trauma care over the last 2 decades has been the adoption of damage control principles .
initially , the patient undergoes resuscitative , abbreviated surgery , where control of hemorrhage and contamination is rapidly obtained and definitive repairs deferred . the patient is then transported to the intensive care unit ( icu ) where active rewarming , correction of coagulopathy and acidosis occurs . once normal physiology is restored , definitive surgical management is completed .
