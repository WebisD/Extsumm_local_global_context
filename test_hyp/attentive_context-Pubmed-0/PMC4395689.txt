this study investigated the changes of a brain wave and visual perception following nfb and 
 the manner in which these changes affect daily life in stoke patients . also , we aimed to 
 indicate the effective therapeutic method to clinicians engaged in the cognitive 
 rehabilitation of patients with stroke .
comparison of the differences before 
 and after the interventions between the two groups revealed significant differences in mvpt 
 raw score and processing time ( p<0.05 ) .
regarding visual perception before and after nfb , both the nfb group and control group 
 showed statistically significant differences in mvpt raw score and processing time .
in addition , post - test check - ups should be performed to determine 
 how long the changes last . standardized and more elaborate eeg measurement and analysis are 
 required to provide sufficient evidence for neurofeedback brain wave training .
the nfb program is considered to have been more 
 effective in improving visual perception ability because the training was on watching and 
 focusing with the eyes .
more research into the development of an attention and concentration training program that 
 fits the rehabilitation purpose of not only stroke patients but also patients with other 
 illnesses is necessary .
