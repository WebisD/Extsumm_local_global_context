posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( pres ) was first reported as reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome in 1996 .
it is important to consider this diagnosis in children presenting with seizure , visual disturbances , headache , and altered mentation in appropriate clinical setting .
we describe a series of children with kidney disease who developed pres and describe their clinical and laboratory features .
diagnosis was made in appropriate clinical setting with neurological symptoms supported by neurological imaging by computed tomography ( ct ) scan brain , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and diffusion weighted images .
out of total 660 pediatric renal patients including renal transplant patients admitted at our institute during september 2010 to february 2012 ( 18 months ) , we identified 11 patients with characteristic neurological symptom complex in association with typical neurological images suggesting pres as described in introduction .
initially , it was described in acutely ill patients who had a reversible syndrome of headache , altered mental function , seizure , and loss of vision associated with findings indicating predominantly posterior leucoencephalopathy on imaging studies .
hypertension , renal disease , immunosuppression , and chemotherapy of malignancies are triggers for pres .
