the present study showed that without expressing any influenza 
 specific antigen , treatment of orfv significantly inhibited expression of np protein in 
 cells , and also , one dose ( 10 pfu ) of orfv immunization is able to reduce the 
 influenza viral load in mouse lung . based on the cytokine expression profile , it appears 
 orfv infection elevates levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( il-6 or il-8 ) .
orfv , an epitheliotropic parapoxvirus , causes proliferative dermatitis in goats and sheep , 
 and persistence infection usually occurs in an outbreak farm .
our results indicated that the production of proinflammatory cytokines , such as il-6 and 
 tnf- , was significantly increased in the sera of mice pre - treated with orfv compared with 
 that in the sera of mice receiving the pbs before iav infection ( fig .
the isolation 
 of parapoxviruses from cows , goats and sheep and serows as well as from ruminant animals 
 ( musk ox and sichuan takin ) of a zoo was claimed   ; two of these studies investigated diseases of 
 goats   .
however , further 
 studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of suppressing influenza virus infection . 
 in summary ,
this is in line with previous findings ; tnf- 
 contributes to resolving influenza virus infection in the host respiratory tract , and il-6 promotes viral clearance and reduces 
 mortality to influenza virus infection via enhancing neutrophil survival from influenza 
 virus - induced death .
