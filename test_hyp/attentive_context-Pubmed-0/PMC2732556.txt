virologic surveillance activities need to be initiated or expanded in countries that are in the outbreak control phase of measles control to obtain an accurate record of the pattern of endemic viral genotypes present in all areas of the world .
rather , the diversity of genotypes reflects multiple , imported sources of measles virus . when the source of virus was identified by standard epidemiologic investigation , virologic surveillance helped to confirm the source of the virus and to build a genetic database of viral sequences associated with imported cases from different areas .
virologic surveillance was especially useful for characterizing 13 chains of infection in which the source of infection could not be identified by standard epidemiologic methods .
virologic surveillance will play a key role in documenting the elimination of endemic transmission of the genotype d6 viruses in south and central america in the same manner that was used to document the elimination of the genotype d3 viruses in the united states .
sequence data obtained from 55 viral isolates or clinical specimens from measles cases in the united states during 19972001 indicated that 11 genotypes of virus were represented .
  this study demonstrates the utility of virologic surveillance , especially for countries in the elimination phase of measles control .
