the objectives of the present study were to collect epidemiological data on mi in north punjab and to evaluate the environmental risk factors responsible for mi with a view to lessening the disease burden through modifications in lifestyle .
the mean age of the participants from the rural areas was 56.8  14.34 and from the urban areas was 55.7  11.26 with a range of 20 - 80 years , while 53.79% of the patients were in the range of 41 - 60 years of age ( p = 0.270 ) among the rural and urban populations in both genders .
figure 2 depicts the relationship between the monthly income and the overall cost ( i.e. ecg , computerized tomography ( ct scan ) , angiography , surgery , and medication ) of the mi patients ( p = 0.917 ) . according to the kruskal test , however ,
our data demonstrated that the mi patients living in the urban areas , in comparison with those living in the rural regions , had a high level of mi risk factors ( i.e. physical inactivity , hypertension , and diabetes ) and should , therefore , be treated as a high - risk group for prevention and treatment .
