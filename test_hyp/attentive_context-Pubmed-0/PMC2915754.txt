therefore , the aims of this study were to evaluate infection in b10.a and a / j mice ( both h-2 ) , compare the survival rate and tissue lesions , and analyze the proliferative response and production of ifn- and il-10 in cultures of spleen cells from normal and immunized mice stimulated with the crude extract of the parasite ( ce ) or concanavalin a ( cona ) .
we are currently investigating the kinetics of cytokine production in a / j and b10.a mice infected with l. minor to better understand the immunological mechanisms involved in the resistance to the infection .
, the a / j mice , which are more resistant to infection , displayed a better proliferative response and greater production of il-10 and ifn- against ce antigen and cona when immunized with l. minor antigens , compared to the susceptible b10.a mice which presented a lower proliferative response and less il-10 and ifn-. this intense inflammatory response may be a consequence of an uncontrolled reaction caused by the small amount of il-10 produced in b10.a mice . in a / j mice ,
spleen lymphocytes from a / j mice immunized with ce and stimulated with cona ( positive control ) or ce of the parasite showed better proliferative response when compared to b10.a mice , particularly against the ce of the parasite .
