we report 2 patients infected with panton - valentine leukocidin ( pvl)positive mrsa t034 . each patient had a medical history typical of that reported for community - acquired mrsa of other lineages , which in most cases are pvl positive ( 8) . the first patient , a previously healthy 36-year - old male physiotherapist , sought medical care in march 2006 for a small abscess in his axilla . culture of the abscess grew mrsa .
these case reports suggest that strains of this lineage may impose a threat in the community , even to patients with no obvious animal contact .
since neither patient had even a remote connection to animals and we found no common source of infection , these strains may already be more common in our region than we had thought .
the second patient , a 43-year - old male clerk , also previously healthy , sought medical attention during the summer of 2007 for a mrsa - infected elbow wound .
these strains carry pvl , a toxin partly responsible for the increased virulence of several of the mrsa clones in the community ( 8) . despite several recent publications concerning st398 mrsa ,
