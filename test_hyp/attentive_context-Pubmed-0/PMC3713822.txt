, we described the characteristics of ciprofloxacin - resistant s. enterica serovar kentucky isolates in canada .
resistance to ciprofloxacin in salmonella spp . is a growing concern because it limits the ability to treat invasive disease . in this study
similar drug - resistance patterns and genetic backgrounds of s. enterica serovar kentucky have been observed in europe and linked to travel to countries in africa ( 3 ) . that most isolates had multidrug resistance phenotypes is of particular concern .
the canadian integrated program for antimicrobial resistance surveillance ( cipars ) , established in 2003 , monitors antimicrobial drug use and resistance in selected species of enteric bacteria from humans , animals , and animal - derived food sources across canada ( www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ cipars - picra / surv - eng.php ) .
many ciprofloxacin - resistant s. enterica serovar kentucky human infections identified in europe have been linked to travel to countries in africa ( 3 ) . of 23 case - patients in canada
submitted for susceptibility testing as part of the human component of the cipars program since 2003 , s. enterica serovar kentucky had a significantly higher rate of ciprofloxacin resistance than all other nontyphoidal salmonella isolates and comprised 66% ( 23/35 ; p<0.0001 ) of all ciprofloxacin - resistant isolates identified during that period . in canada , ciprofloxacin - resistant s. enterica serovar kentucky was first identified in 2005 , when 22% ( 2/9 ) of isolates submitted for drug susceptibility testing were resistant to this drug . a significant increase ( or 10.5 , 95% ci 1.1159.913 , p = 0.04 ) in the number of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin
