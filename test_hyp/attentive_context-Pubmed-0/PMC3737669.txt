development of multiple aneurysms at sites away from punctures in patients with ckd following percutaneous renal intervention is very unusual .
its causation including infection with bacteria and fungus and resultant angiopathy needs to be explored .
clinical , microbiological , and radiological findings of all the patients who underwent renal angiography for post - renal biopsy , post - pcn , or post - pnl bleed for a period of 5 years were reviewed .
percutaneous nephrostomy ( pcn ) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pnl ) are established minimally invasive renal interventions .
we encountered unusual findings of bleeding from new lesions away from initial intervention site on repeat angiography with recurrent bleeding after initial angioembolization .
patient 1 : left renal angiogram digital substraction ( dsa ) shows pseudoaneurysm ( arrow ) near the inferior pole of kidney , in relation to lower division of anterior middle segmental artery ( a ) .
preoperative renal function , presence of any coagulopathy , renal diversion if any , microbiological status of urine , site of puncture , number of puncture , per - operative bleeding complications , postoperative hematuria requiring blood transfusion , need of embolization , recurrence of bleeding , and their management and outcome were analyzed .
