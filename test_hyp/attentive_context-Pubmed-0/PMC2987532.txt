this study showed that nematodes can reduce d. v. virgifera emergence in all three of the soil types tested .
however , the higher efficacy in soils with high clay and silt content was surprising because several previous studies suggested that sandy soils provide good conditions for nematode survival , movement , host finding behaviour and infectivity ( e.g. , kung et al .
another reason might be that population pressure of d. v. virgifera is usually higher in regions with heavy and dense soils due to higher intensity of maize growing when compared to regions with sandy soils considered suboptimal for maize production due to soil aridity ( i. zseller , 2008 , personal communication ) . in conclusion , the efficacy data presented here suggest that nematodes might be suitable biological control agents for managing d. v. virgifera in most soils , including heavy non - sandy soils , such as those found in the intensive maize production areas of central europe . on average across soils , h. bacteriophora was more effective at controlling d. v. virgifera larvae ( 43% ) than h. megidis ( 23% ) and s. feltiae ( 11% )
one explanation for the apparently high efficacy of nematodes in non - sandy soils might be that the nematodes were applied too close to maize roots and d. v. virgifera ( here 150  mm ) to detect a reduction in nematode movement in heavy soils with low sand content .
