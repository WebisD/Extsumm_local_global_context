the majority of patients diagnosed with incompetent cervix can be treated successfully with a transvaginal cerclage .
a select group of patients who have failed the vaginal approach , or have extremely short cervices , anatomically deformed cervix , deeply lacerated cervices , or severely scarred from previous failed vaginal cerclages may benefit from the transabdominal approach .
the patient is a 36-year - old african - american woman ( gravida 2 , para 2 , aborta 0 , last menstrual period 4/1/03 ) referred from our maternal fetal medicine division for consideration for laparoscopic cerclage .
certainly , the usual treatment for women at risk for cervical incompetence is a cerclage placed transvaginally . when this approach has failed , or when this approach is not possible because of anatomic deformities , a transabdominal cerclage is a viable option . data clearly show an improved fetal survival rate compared with fetal survival in untreated pregnancies .
the patient was taken to the operating room after extensive counseling as to possible laparotomy and bleeding and underwent laparoscopic placement of an abdominal cerclage using a 5-mm mersilene band as is the usual suture used by our maternal fetal medicine ( mfm ) division .
