almost all the immunocompromised patients with osteomyelitis of long bones due to mucormycosis require aggressive debridement and may sometimes need amputation.2 we present a patient with acute myeloid leukemia , who was diagnosed to have mucormycosis osteomyelitis of right proximal femur and was treated with limb salvage surgery successfully .
it is a life and limb threatening fungal infection with high mortality rate of 40%.1 though mucormycosis presents as a spectrum of disease , it is very rare in the musculoskeletal system .
mucormycosis is an aggressive invasive opportunistic fungal infection belonging to the order mucorales , usually found in immunocompromised individuals .
high index of clinical suspicion , early diagnosis , aggressive debridement , and adequate liposomal amphotericin b are the key treatment modalities in the successful management of musculoskeletal mucormycosis .
a 41-year - old gentleman presented with sudden onset of pain and swelling over his right groin and upper thigh for a period of 10 days .
we present this case in view of the unusual site of presentation , limb - threatening osteomyelitis which was treated with radical debridement , liposomal amphotericin therapy , and using antifungal beads to enable limb salvage .
he was a known patient with type ii diabetes mellitus and acute myeloid leukemia m2 diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow morphology and immunophenotyping 2 years ago .
