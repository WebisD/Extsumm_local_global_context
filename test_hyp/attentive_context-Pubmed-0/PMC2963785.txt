, we investigated the risk factors for possible bowel interposition between the bladder and the skin at the routine puncture site of suprapubic cystostomy by computed tomography ( ct ) , assuming that a hypothetical suprapubic cystostomy was performed .
when performing a suprapubic cystostomy , extreme caution is needed to avoid possible bowel injury in patients who are obese , who have had previous radical pelvic operations , and who have a short distance ( 11 cm ) between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus .
the univariate analysis showed that sex ( female , p=0.028 ) , obesity ( body mass index [ bmi]25 kg / m , p=0.006 ) , a positive history of radical pelvic surgery ( p<0.001 ) , and a short distance ( 11 cm , p=0.016 ) between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus were significantly correlated with bowel interposition at the routine suprapubic puncture site ( table 2 ) . among the 22 patients who had a radical pelvic operation , 20 had lower anterior resection , and the other 2 had segmental resection of the rectum due to rectal or colon cancer . in the multivariate analysis ,
