furthermore , we evaluated the immunological responses in the peripheral blood by measuring the levels of nks and some subsets of t lymphocytes ( cd4 + t cells , cd8 + t cells , and nk t cells [ ctls ] ) and determining whether these immunoregulatory observations correlated with the progress of the disease .
interferon ( ifn ) was one of the first cytokines found to have anticancer effects , and it was introduced into the combined modality regimens used to treat small cell lung cancer ( sclc ) in the early 1980s in an attempt to overcome the problem of early relapse .
interestingly , when patients with only limited disease were considered , a significant survival benefit in group b was revealed compared with control group a ( p = 0.039 ) , group c ( p , 0.005 ) , and group d ( p = 0.038 ) .
significantly more patients in the immunotherapy groups than in the chemotherapy group experienced toxicity , but in groups b , c , and d , symptoms were mild and well manageable .
median survival was 10 months for group a ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 9.310.6 months ) , 10.3 months for group b ( 95% ci , 7.1313.5 months ) , 8.3 months for group c ( 95% ci , 6.89.8 months ) , and 11 months ( 95% ci , 9.212.8 months ) for group d. if we compare all groups together , there is no significant difference in survival , even with pairwise comparison among four groups ( p .
