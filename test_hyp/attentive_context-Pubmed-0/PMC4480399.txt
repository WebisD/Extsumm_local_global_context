comparison of the small- , medium- , and large - segment sequences of schmallenberg viruses isolated in 2012 from the blood of viremic ruminants or detected in 2014 in acutely infected adult cattle with the first sbv isolate from 2011 , germany .
virus genome with a high sequence identity to the first sbv sample was repeatedly detected in the blood of acutely infected adult cattle , and in experimentally infected animals , viremia developed that was identical to the original sbv isolate .
the infection of naive animals in autumn 2014 resulted in an increasing frequency of the birth of malformed offspring in the following winter .
the missing or markedly reduced virus circulation led to a decline in herd seroprevalence caused by a missing infection of the young stock ( 14,15 ) ; further reasons for the unexpected recurrence of sbv could be persistence within the insect vectors . as a consequence ,
phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of the medium segment of schmallenberg virus samples isolated from blood of acutely infected animals in 2011 or 2012 ( blue ) or sequenced directly from the blood of viremic cattle in 2014 ( red ) and from organ samples of malformed newborns ( black ) ( 7 ) .
