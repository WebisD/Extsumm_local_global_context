much research is needed in this area as dys - synchronies of all types can lead to overloaded muscles and dyspneic patients requiring sedation - two factors that clearly can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation days and poor outcomes .
assisted / supported mechanical ventilation is designed to interact with patient muscle activity and ' share ' the work of breathing . if properly done , assisted /
this study is important as it underscores that patient - ventilator trigger dys - synchrony is common   and can be a major barrier to niv effectiveness .
carlucci and colleagues have demonstrated how common the trigger dys - synchronies are during niv and that understanding them requires assessment not only of respiratory system mechanics , but also the complex interactions of neural drive , gas exchange , muscle function , and muscle loading .
carlucci and colleagues   have recently studied patient - ventilator interactions in 69 acutely ill patients receiving non - invasive ventilation ( niv ) for a variety of reasons .
this study also underscores the fact that the causes of trigger dys - synchrony are complex and affect all types of patients requiring assisted / supported mechanical ventilation [ 3 - 5 ] . like invasive mechanical ventilation , niv trigger dys - synchrony can stem from insensitive / poorly responsive breath triggering mechanisms . however , other factors also involved likely include ventilatory muscle loading patterns and their effects on the ventilatory controller , ventilatory muscle function , lung volumes at end - expiration ( that is , intrinsic positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) ) , gas exchange effectiveness , and cortical inputs to the patient 's ventilatory control center such as pain [ 3 - 5 ] . in addition , the triggering process with niv can be further hampered by the mask system with its inherent leaks and claustrophobia exaggerating dyspnea and neural drive .
