chiari i malformation is a heterogeneous entity characterized by impaired cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) circulation at the level of the foramen magnum due to cerebellar tonsillar ectopia .
several cases of associated syncope have been reported as a presenting symptom caused by craniovertebral junction anatomic abnormalities.1

  advanced lesions associated with chiari malformations and assimilation of the atlas may compress the medulla upon the clivus or cause temporary vascular occlusion resulting in brainstem ischemia and abnormalities in heart rate and respiration.9

  we here present a patient harboring both a chiari i malformation and atlanto - occipital assimilation contributing to cough syncope , orthopnea , and apnea .
a 54-year - old man with history of sleep apnea presented to our neurosurgical clinic with complaints of progressive orthopnea and multiple episodes of cough syncope .
concomitant with atlanto - occipital assimilation , the reduction in size of the foramen magnum may result in profound respiratory abnormalities that may require a more extensive decompression .
less common presentations include motor deficiencies , lower cranial nerve palsies , sensory dysfunctions , nystagmus , vertigo , ataxia , dysphagia , apnea , and snoring .
