thus , we recommend performing an isometric squat at 90 to maximize neuromuscular recruitment of the knee and hip extensors .
therefore , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the maximal isometric muscle activation of the lower limbs during three different knee joint - angle positions in the back squat exercise .
there was a significant main effect of vl ( p < 0.001 ) , vm ( p = 0.030 ) , rf ( p = 0.018 ) , and gm ( p < 0.001 ) for muscle activity during three different knee joint - angle positions ( 20 , 90 , and 140 ) in the isometric back squat .
an isometric back squat at 90 generates the highest overall muscle activation , yet an isometric back squat at 140 generates the lowest overall muscle activation of the vl and gm only .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the maximal isometric muscle activation of the lower limbs during three different knee joint - angle positions in the back squat exercise .
after the warm - up and familiarization , all subjects performed three trials of 10-second maximal isometric contractions against a locked smith machine under three different knee joint - angle positions in a randomized , counterbalanced order : back squat at 20 degrees ( 20 ) ; back squat at 90 degrees ( 90 ) ; and back squat at 140 degrees ( 140 ) .
