the objective of this study was to assess the prognostic role of 14f7 mab immunoreactivity in patients with cc and evaluate the relationship between its expression and clinicopathological features .
this study is the first approach on the prognostic significance of 14f7 mab immunoreactivity , against n - glycolyl gm3 ganglioside , in patients with colon adenocarcinoma .
the present study is the first to evaluate the prognostic significance of 14f7 mab immunostainingin patients with colon adenocarcinoma .
furthermore , patients with high level of 14f7 mab immunoreactivity had significantly impaired 5-year dfs ( p = 0,046 ) than those with low level ( 60,9% versus 92,3% ) .
furthermore , the role of neugcgm3 in tumor biology and its differential expression in tumor cells suggest its potential use as target for immunotherapy .
a moderate correlation was found between percentage of positive tumor cells and staining intensity ( spearman 's correlation coefficient 0,606 ; p = 0,000 ) . according to irs ,
univariate survival analysis confirmed the poor os associated with tnm stage and lymphovascular invasion , two putative pathologic markers of invasion and adverse outcome in cc .
, there was a significant difference in the 5-year os rates between high and low 14f7 mab immunostaining ( 40% versus 86,7% ; p = 0,002 ) .
