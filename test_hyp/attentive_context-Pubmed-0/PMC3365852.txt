we overview genome alterations , with a focus on unusual genome rearrangements observed in mycoreoviruses and discuss differences between other reovirus rearrangements in type of genome segment alterations and possible mechanisms underlying their occurrence .
the family reoviridae accommodates a wide range of members that infect protists , fungi , plants , invertebrates , and vertebrates , and are characterized by 912 segmented double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) genomes , multi - layered virion structures , and particle - associated enzymes for rna synthesis .
three unusual types of genome alterations are found in the genus mycoreovirus ; a s8-deficient myrv3 mutant , a myrv1 variant with two rearranged segments ( s4ss and s10ss ) each lacking three fourths of the orf , and myrv1 variants with genome rearrangements ( s1l , s2l , s3l , s6l , and s10ss ) induced by a multifunctional protein p29 of an unrelated virus , chv1 . while s8-lacking myrv3 strains have properties indistinguishable from wild - type myrv3 , most myrv1 variants with rearranged segments induced different symptoms in the chestnut blight fungus than the wild - type virus .
the chv1 p29-dependent rearrangements of myrv1 are a novel type of intriguing virus / virus interactions , and accordingly there are a few important unanswered questions . what is the biological significance of the interactions between the two viruses ?
