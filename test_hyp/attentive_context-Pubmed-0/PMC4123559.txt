in this large sample of middle - school students at increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes , we found that adiposity indicators bmiz ( with reference to cdc 2000 growth charts ) and whtr ( without reference to sex and age ) had similar utility for identifying adverse levels of cardiometabolic variables .
, we examined the performance of bmi z - score ( bmiz , referenced to cdc 2000 growth charts for the united states ) and whtr for the purpose of cardiometabolic risk assessment .
if a well - standardized waist measurement comes into widespread use for clinical assessments of pediatric adiposity , patients and their families may improve their intuitive understanding of how excess adiposity contributes to adverse health risk .
similarly , both adiposity indicators were associated with diastolic blood pressure more strongly among high - fatness students ( 0.230.32 ; p < 0.001 for each of 4 beta coefficients ) than among lower - fatness students ( 0.030.05 ; p > 0.05 for each of four beta coefficients ) . for identification of lipid outcomes , however , we found steeper beta coefficients only among high - fatness boys ( compared to lower - fatness boys ) whose adiposity was assessed by bmiz . for both sexes assessed by whtr ,
