this was a case report of a 45-year - old male patient who presented with subcuataneous swelling in the left loin , which on biopsy showed metastatic papillary cancer .
skin metastasis from a thyroid carcinoma is rarely a presenting feature of an underlying malignancy .
there are no previous reports of positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) in patients with loin metastasis from an unknown primary and identified as papillary cancer thyroid .
this is the first case of identifying primary papillary cancer with subcutaneous metastasis in pet / ct . recognizing and understanding the clinical findings
cutaneous metastasis from dtc is also a rare manifestation of thyroid cancer . a review on roughly 60 cases of dtc skin metastases , which have been documented in the literatures , stated that pc has a greater preponderance for skin metastases
subcutaneous metastasis from differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( dtc ) is a rare manifestation of disseminated disease .
some of the authors believe that follicular carcinoma of the thyroid has a higher propensity to metastasize to the skin , followed by papillary carcinoma , then anaplastic carcinoma and finally medullary carcinoma .
all agree that the scalp is the most common site of thyroid carcinoma skin metastases .
