the purpose of this in - vivo study was to determine whether a direct relationship exists between the size of articulation paper marks and the degree of applied occlusal force percentage observed on the same tooth .
however , employing a non - subjective , quantifying occlusal indicator like computerized occlusal analysis , to guide the selection of tooth contacts for occlusal adjustment treatment , may produce more comprehensive and evidence - based results .
these findings illustrate a low correlation of 38.3% between the mark surface area and force percentage , and a causative relationship of 6 2/3 % when using the coefficient of determination ( r = 0.067 ) .
south boston , ma , usa ) uses an electronically - charged , mylar - encased recording sensor ( high - definition generation iv sensor , tekscan inc . s. boston , ma , usa ) that is scanned in 0.003 second time - increments , to acquire occlusal contact relative force variances , excessively forceful tooth contacts , and occlusal contact timing sequences.16,17 the recording sensor is placed intraorally between the dental arches , to capture real - time occlusal force and time - sequence data , when a subject intercuspates , or makes excursive movements , across its ' recording surface .
