levetiracetam ( lev ) is used to treat generalized and partial seizures of various etiologies .
rhabdomyolysis postconvulsive seizure may limit kidney excretion of muscle breakdown products like creatine phosphokinase ( cpk ) . in this case report ,
although this scenario could indicate a delayed rhabdomyolysis , the rapid decline in cpk with lev discontinuation suggests that , in this patient , lev may have had effects on kidney filtration and/or muscle breakdown .
a 19-year - old right - handed male presented following a complex partial seizure with secondary generalization in the setting of stress and sleep deprivation . a second convulsive event lasting 2  min occurred in the emergency room .
this case revealed a marked and dangerous increase in cpk levels corresponding with modest lev use .
two convulsive seizures and subsequent lev therapy led to a dramatic increase in cpk in this muscular male .
epilepsy etiology was due to a right frontal arteriovenous malformation ( avm ) located in the left leg primary motor cortex ( fig .  1 ) .
a retrial of lev with cpk and renal function checks , a muscle biopsy , and a repeat renal ultrasound are not planned , given that the patient 's clinical issues have resolved .
