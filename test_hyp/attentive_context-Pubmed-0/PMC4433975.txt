accordingly , the purpose of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of an 
 accelerometer in measuring upper extremity activities .
the arat scores were higher on the 
 non - affected side ( p<0.05 ) , while upper limb activity was higher on the affected side 
 ( p<0.05 ) ( table 2table 2.median differences in arat and acceleration scores between the affected and 
 non - affected sidesaffected sidenon - affected sidearat42.8 ( 11.1)57 ( 0)accelerometer74488.3 ( 51778.1)35963.1 ( 11240.5)values are mean ( sd ) , p<0.05 ) .
however , the results of 
 this study indicate that the accelerometer is a sensitive tool for measuring upper limb 
 activity .
the correlation coefficient between arat and accelerometer results indicates 
 that the results were not significantly correlated ( table 3table 3.correlation between arat and the accelerometerarat ( affected side)accelerometer ( affected side)0.24accelerometer ( non - affected side)0.91 ) .
there was a significant difference in the median score between the affected and non - affected 
 sides both the arat and accelerometer results .
