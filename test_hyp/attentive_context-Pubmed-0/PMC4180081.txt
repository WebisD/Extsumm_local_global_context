finally , we demonstrate our parameters  in action  by 
 modeling metal substitution in the active site of the human and e. coli variants of glyoxalase i.
qvist and warshel proposed a solution to this problem 
 in 
 1990 , presenting a nonbonded octahedral 
 dummy model to describe transition metals , which allowed one to capture 
 fundamental properties of the metal center such as m 
metal ions are crucial to biology , 
 fulfilling a range of chemical 
 and structural functions that make life possible , but accurately describing 
 metal centers in molecular simulations remains a significant bottleneck 
 in computational chemistry and biology .
however , while complex metal centers are by now routinely modeled 
 in computational organometallic chemistry and in qm / mm studies of biological systems , the high computational cost associated with using a density functional 
 theory based description of the metal center makes use of such an 
 approach untenable in long time scale biomolecular simulations . additionally , 

we have tested our model using two different popular water models 
 ( spc and tip3p ) and show that our parameters are easily transferable to any force 
 field that describes nonpolar interactions using a lennard - jones potential . 

ideally , one would like to 
 have a full quantum mechanical description of the metal center , particularly 
 as this would allow one to correctly describe ligand - to - metal charge 
 transfer , and changes of spin state in the case of transition metals .
