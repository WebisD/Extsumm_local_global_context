below we present a case study of a patient whose considerable oesophageal leiomyoma was both a diagnostic and therapeutic problem .
combining the skills of a team of surgeons and thoracic surgeons provides an optimal therapeutic procedure to a patient with a large tumour . a complete resection of the lesion combined with resection of the oesophagus was the optimal therapeutic procedure , which led to the patient 's recovery .
although oesophageal leiomyoma is a benign neoplasm , its diagnostics and treatment are often a serious challenge for the whole team of physicians .
a patient , aged 54 , was admitted to the department of general surgery and surgical oncology , wielkopolska cancer centre , where she was to be treated for a posterior mediastinal tumour , which filled the left half of her chest .
the most common location in the alimentary tract is the oesophagus , where the tumour is responsible for most diagnoses of benign tumors of the organ .
the analysis of a group of 63 patients with the tumour , who were treated in one centre , revealed that the location in the central part of the oesophagus concerned 47.6% of the patients and the distal location 37.1% of the patients .
