scientists have recognized communication between the brain and the gut for more than 100 years , with studies in the early 19th and 20th centuries showing that a person s emotional state can alter the function of the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract.13 one of the best examples is the work of william beaumont , an army surgeon , who became known as the  father of gastric physiology .  in the 1830s , beaumont , who was able to monitor gastric secretions through a fistula ( a permanent opening in the stomach wall ) , noted an association between changing moods and gastric secretions . in the mid - to - late 1900s , research examining stress biology and its impact on human health uncovered clear connections between an individual s stress response and gut function .
microbiota  certainly an important modulator of health  must be considered as one component of a complex , multifaceted communication system needed to establish a healthy balance for brain development and function .
changes in gut microbiota may influence risk of disease , and manipulating microbiota may provide novel ways to intervene in clinical situations related to mood and anxiety disorders .
there is no doubt that research in the last decade has established a link between gut microbiota and brain function in mice .
