there is considerable evidence to support the hypothesis that the cluster of complications from metabolic syndrome status converges to a derangement of the cardiovascular system . in fact , cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this condition .
the use of different experimental models that mimic the metabolic derangements seen in this syndrome is extremely important in order to better understand the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular changes caused by metabolic syndrome .
studies on animal models can be relevant as they mimic the aspects of the human disease as the development and maintenance of ms characteristics , particularly obesity , type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia , and hypertension .
thus , a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome becomes of paramount importance in clinical practice .
in addition , it is well known that insulin resistance plays a key role in ms and as such contributes to the development of premature cardiovascular atherosclerosis , independent of the association with diabetes and obesity   .
it seems reasonable to assume that the association of several risk factors , as in the ms , favors an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases and death risks in humans .
