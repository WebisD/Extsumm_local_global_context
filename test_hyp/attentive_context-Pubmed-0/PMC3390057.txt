results of several preclinical and clinical studies indicate that short - term exposure of injured arteries to paclitaxel eluted from regular percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and ptca balloons may be sufficient to reduce late lumen loss and restenosis rates during a critical period of time after angioplasty of diseased coronary and peripheral arteries.- we present a case of particularly proliferative instent restenosis treated with a new type of drug eluting balloon .
a 68-year - old man with severe silent ischemia was admitted to our center for elective coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention . the patient had bypass grafting of left anterior descending ( lad , with mammary artery ) , first obtuse marginal branch and right coronary artery ( rca ) 6 years before .
drug - coated balloon has been developed as an alternative to drug - eluting stents ( des ) .
the genie catheter has been used in in - stent restenosis after bare - metal stent implantation . however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report about its use in very long proliferative and occlusive in - stent - restenosis after des treatment .
the presented case suggests that drug - infusion balloon can offer an effective therapeutic option in selected patients with very extensive in - stent restenosis after des implantation .
