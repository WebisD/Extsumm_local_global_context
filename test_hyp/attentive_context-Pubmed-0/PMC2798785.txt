the technical quality of root fillings and restoration in a turkish subpopulation was poor and was consistent with a high prevalence of apical periodontitis .
if radiographs reveal that a lesion has remained the same or has only diminished in size , the treatment is not considered a success.1,2 it is generally accepted that the outcome of endodontic treatment is positively correlated with the technical quality of the root filling , expected to provide an hermetic seal against bacterial ingress.3,4 however , it has been suggested that the quality of the coronal restoration may also have an impact on the periapical health of root - filled teeth;5,6 when the restoration quality is good , this may allow for a favorable outcome even when the root filling quality is poor.7 attention has been focused on the prevalence and the technical quality of root fillings through the evaluation of intraoral810 or panoramic radiographs.2,11,12 epidemiologic studies have been performed on the root canal morphology in turkish populations.13,14 information about the prevalence and technical standard of root - canal treatment , and the occurence of periapical lesions in turkey are scarce.12,15 moreover , there is only one investigation about quality of root fillings and coronal restorations in turkish population.16 the aim of the present study was to relate the quality of root canal treatment and coronal restorations to the periapical status of root filled teeth in adult turkish population based on radiographic examination .
