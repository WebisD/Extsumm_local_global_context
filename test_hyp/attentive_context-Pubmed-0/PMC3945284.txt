polarization of t cells and macrophages with cytokines influences every aspect of the immune response , including innate and adaptive immunity   .
lllt may be a potent immune - enhancing agent that is suitable for the treatment of allergic diseases but may not be a good therapy for autoimmune and rheumatoid disorders .
we investigated the regulatory effects of lllt on monocyte m1 polarization to provide evidence for the use of lllt for immunologic disorders .
moreover , our results demonstrated that lllt significantly increased the activities of complexes i , ii , iii , and iv and succinate dehydrogenase compared to the muscle injury group without treatment .
next , we investigated whether lllt - induced ip-10 expression in human monocytes was induced by increasing histone acetylation and trimethylation .
because tnf- , mcp-1 , and ip-10 are important indicators of lllt - induced m1 polarization , lllt may promote anti - viral and anti - tumor immunity but enhance autoimmune and rheumatoid diseases .
, our results showed that after five days of muscular lesion , the activities of complex ii and succinate dehydrogenase elevated considerably in contrast to the control group .
studies in monocytes and macrophages have shown that although there are different patterns of histone modifications , the main regulatory regions associated with histone modifications could be identified in lllt - treated monocytes . in fact , the involvement of histone acetylation in the regulation of tnf- expression was further supported by the finding that aa significantly suppressed tnf- expression in lllt - treated thp-1 cells ( figure 6(a ) ) . to determine whether histone modifications occurred in thetnf- gene locus in monocytes , chip analysis of thp-1 cells treated with lllt
