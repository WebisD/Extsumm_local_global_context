the major early causes of death are graft failure and non - cmv infections , bronchitis obliterans syndrome ( bos ) , chronic lung rejection , and graft failure after one year .
according to the statistical analysis of the international society of heart and lung transplantation , survival after lung transplantation systematically improves .
the most common indication for lung transplantation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) ( 34% ) .
a 58-year - old female with hyperthyroidism , osteoporosis , and copd in the fourth stage was classified for lung transplantation in 2011 .
finally , meticulous training of the transplantation team in surgical techniques should be continued , which is achieved in our case by practicing microsurgical techniques on rats and by using a cadaver workshops .
lung transplantation in medically incurable patients is the only method that gives a chance to lengthen their lives .
88% of recipients survive three months after operation , 79% survive for one year , and about 50 - 60% of recipients survive five years after transplantation .
the recommended operation technique is bilateral lung transplantation because of the reservoir of microorganisms in the recipient 's own lung , so nowadays in such a clinical situation probably reconstruction of the donor 's right pulmonary vein cuff would be performed .
