. we present a case of a pavm with ea that is suspected to have hht .
a pavm is a rare pulmonary vascular anomaly with an incidence of 2 - 3 per 100,000 population.1 ) pavms may be single or multiple , and the left lower lobe of the lung is the most common location of solitary pavm.2 ) greater than 80% of pavms are congenital , and approximately 50% of these are associated with hht , also known as rendu - osler - weber disease.2)3 ) a single pavm < 2 cm in diameter on chest radiography usually does not cause symptoms.4 ) the most common complaint is epistaxis . a pavm can cause dyspnea , cyanosis , hemoptysis , hemothorax , and serious neurologic complications , such as strokes , seizures , and brain abscesses.4)5 ) patients with co - existing hht tend to have multiple arteriovenous malformations , rapid disease progression , and a higher complication rate.2 ) the brain , lungs , and liver are the most frequently involved organs in patients with hht.6 ) ea is a congenital cardiac malformation characterized by downward displacement of the attachment of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve.7 ) ea is also a rare disorder occurring in 1 per 200,000 live births.7 ) most cases are sporadic , and the embryologic and genetic contributors are unclear,8 ) but the ea gene might be located on chromosome 9.9 ) the genetic linkages to hht are located on chromosome 9 or 12.10 ) patients with ea may have various additional cardiovascular anomalies.8)11 ) however , there are no reports concerning the co - existence of a pavm or hht with ea .
