here is a presentation of a birth traumatic case with bilateral pleural effusion successfully treated by octreotide .
a 3100-g - term male newborn delivered vaginally from a 33-year - old mother was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with respiratory distress signs . early chest x - ray ( cxr ) showed bilateral pleural effusion .
therefore , we started feeding with a medium chain triglyceride ( mct ) , but plural effusion was seen once again and we had to restart tpn .
a rare condition in newborns called congenital chylothorax ( cc ) occurs when lymphatic fluid accumulates within the pleural cavity .
finally , the cxr and ultrasound did not show any pleural effusion in both sides and the ultrasound done in the third month showed no pleural effusion either .
the thoracentesis pleural fluid had been drained with these characteristics : glucose : 1.9425 mmol / l , protein : 11
g / l , cholesterol : 1.295 mmol / l , and triglycerides : 3.39 mmol / l . counts of red blood cells and white blood cells were 10,000 and 2500 per cu / mm , respectively ; so , congenital chylothorax was diagnosed and total parenteral nutrition ( tpn ) were initiated .
