thirty - three eyes of 33 patients who underwent implantation of pc iols into the ac between may 2006 and july 2008 were evaluated retrospectively .
posterior capsular rupture is also a well - known intraoperative complication of cataract surgery . in the presence of a posterior capsular tear
was observed in the patients with posterior capsular rupture during surgery compared to the preoperative levels ( 20/50 versus 20/25 ) , while visual acuity increased moderately from 20/40 to 20/30 in those who were previously aphakic and underwent secondary iol insertion .
this study suggests that this technique is a practical alternative that leads to favorable visual outcomes and minimized risk of complications in eyes without adequate capsular support .
while mild guttata was seen in five eyes during the follow - up period , none of the eyes had corneal decompensation . a marked increase in visual acuity
the surgical correction of an iol dislocation in our technique is less traumatic and complicated than that for sclera - fixated or posterior iris - fixated iols .
the number of patients with complications was very small , and the complications were negligible and not vision - threatening .
pupillary block developed in two of the first five patients who had received a pmma iol , and neodymium - doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( nd : yag ) laser iridotomies were performed to relieve the block in these eyes .
