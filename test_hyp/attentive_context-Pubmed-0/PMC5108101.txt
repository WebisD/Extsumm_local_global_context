we investigated the significance of ammonia levels estimation in blunt trauma abdomen patients to predict internal hemorrhage , complications and correlated with need of intervention .
high ammonia levels in bleeding patients ( group i ) correlated well with si as 88.7% of these patients had si > 0.9 , i.e. , having potentially severe trauma requiring immediate treatment .
mean shock index and ammonia levels percentage of patients showing shock index 0.9/0.9 ammonia levels in patients with complications and mortality in group i receiver operating characteristic analysis of hospital stay , shock index , and ammonia levels the cutoff point for ammonia levels is > 58.85 mol / l ( sensitivity 77.42% and specificity 93.37% ) .
one hundred blunt trauma abdomen patients ( > 12 years old ) presented in trauma ward / emergency department of tertiary care hospital were included in the study .
significantly higher number of patients developed complications in group i compared to group ii ( 38 vs. 7 ) and 8% mortality rate was noted in group i only .
biochemical marker which is time and cost effective such as ammonia estimation can predict need of intervention in these patients and best treatment can be provided in the golden hour .
