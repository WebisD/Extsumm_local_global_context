hps is an emerging disease in south america , and investigations strengthen the belief that the disease is underestimated . despite being surrounded by hps - endemic countries ,
a prior study analyzed a collection of sigmodontine rodents from the major biomes of paraguay where 1 a. montensis and 2 o. nigripes were positive for viral rna ( 15 ) .
we characterized a distinct akodon - borne hantavirus at the biologic reserve of paraguay , although we did not investigate whether this virus can produce illness .
prg was characterized in a. azarae populations . despite the absence of reported hps cases associated with this species in the studied area ,
precise identification of source populations in the reservoir and collection of quantitative data on their relative contribution to hantavirus transmission will be essential for disease control in the 3-country frontier .
we confirmed o. nigripes as the reservoir species associated with 2 juqv cases in misiones . in eastern paraguay , itapua department , bmj lineage produced hps .
two pathogenic hantaviruses that cause hps have so far been proven to circulate in misiones : lec and juqv .
three hps cases were confirmed in misiones province , argentina , in the following patients : a 14-year - old boy from santa ana in november 2003 , a 28-year - old man from leandro n. alem in december 2003 , and a 12-year - old boy living in the dos arroyos locality of alem city . in january 2005 , hps was confirmed in a 19-year - old girl living in pirapo , a rural area of itapua department , paraguay .
