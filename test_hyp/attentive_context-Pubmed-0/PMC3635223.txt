, we describe a young girl with bilateral wilms tumor who had marked tumor response after 12 weeks of chemotherapy .
this case illustrates that if surgery is postponed , tumor lysis precautions should be considered when chemotherapy is given to patients with large wilms tumors .
children 's oncology group trial aren0534calls for pre - operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be given in order to shrink tumors to facilitate partial nephrectomies to maximize preservation of normal renal tissue . here
surgery is then followed by several weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy , with radiotherapy used mainly for cases of tumor rupture or peritoneal seeding . though primary kidney resection has long been the cornerstone of effective treatment for wilms tumors , this approach has recently been reevaluated in the context of synchronous bilateral disease .
our case illustrates that wilms tumor , being a chemosensitive embryonal malignancy of childhood , can also be associated with tumor lysis syndrome . in the past
this case also demonstrates that pathologic findings are preserved even after several weeks of chemotherapy .
her case illustrates that tumor lysis precautions should be considered in children with a large amount of disease who undergo neoadjuvant treatment and that pathologic interpretation of the tumor is possible even after many cycles of chemotherapy .
