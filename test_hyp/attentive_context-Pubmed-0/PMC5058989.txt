the risk for osteoporosis was 3.10-fold higher for women than for men ( 95% ci  =  2.813.43 ) and was higher for patients with the comorbidities of hypertension ( ahr  =  1.19 , 95% ci  =  1.071.31 ) , hyperlipidemia ( ahr  =  1.17 , 95% ci  =  1.051.29 ) , and heart failure ( ahr  =  1.23 , 95% ci  =  1.021.49 ) .
after we adjusted for factors such as age , sex , and comorbidities , namely diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , heart failure , stroke , and cirrhosis , the risk of developing osteoporosis was significantly higher in the hcv exposure cohort than in the comparison cohort ( adjusted hr [ ahr ]  =  1.35 ; 95% ci  =  1.211.51 ) . compared with
our results revealed that the hcv exposure cohort had more comorbidities ; however , the risk of osteoporosis remained higher in the hcv exposure cohort after adjusting for age , sex , and the comorbidities of diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , heart failure , stroke , and cirrhosis .
the incidence and hazard ratio for osteoporosis and osteoporosis - associated risk factor the incidence of osteoporosis increased with age , was higher in women than in men , and increased with comorbidity in both cohorts ( table 3 ) .
