44.2% were positive for at least 1 of 15 specific ana antibodies . in terms of the effect of age and sex on ana positivity , there were significant differences among the 3 groups ( ie , 20 years , 2149 years , and 50 years ;  = 275.04 ; p < 0.01 ) , and between male and female (  = 236.47 ; p < 0.01 ) , as shown in table i and table ii , respectively . the autoantibodies with the top-3 positive frequency were anti - ro-52 ( 19% ) , anti - m2 ( 17.8% ) , and anti - ssa ( 14.3% ) ; whereas anti - scl-70 , anti - jo-1 , and anti - sm were the less frequently detected antibodies among the autoantibodies detected ( table iii ) .
we aimed to evaluate the ana prevalence in a wide range of the general chinese population ( aged 288 years ) .
to assess the ana positive rate among the general population of china , we conducted a cross - sectional study .
ana positive frequency is high in the general chinese population and differs in different sex and age groups .
