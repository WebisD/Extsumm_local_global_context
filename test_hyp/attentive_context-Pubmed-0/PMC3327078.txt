we present our experience of spinal anaesthesia in a 29-year - old female with congenital complete heart block for lower segment caesarean section ( lscs ) .
to conclude , we successfully managed a case of congenital complete heart block for operative delivery with temporary pacemaker in situ with intrathecal low - dose bupivacaine 
few patients with congenital heart block may have sudden cardiac death ( scd ) for which there are no predictors .
a 29-year - old parturient ( gravida 3 , para 0 , abortion 2 ) was admitted to our hospital with 9 months of amenorrhea .
parturient with congenital heart block may be asymptomatic but can present with sudden vascular collapse , especially during labour .
also , the fluoroscopy time for positioning the lead was minimized to less than 10 s. the patient was discharged with an advice for permanent pacemaker implantation ( ppi ) . as per the recent guidelines , ppi is indicated for all congenital complete heart blocks ( class 2a / b ) as trials have shown that there is a subgroup of patients who may have scd for which there are no predictors available .
the episode was associated with bradycardia non - responsive to atropine , during which she was evaluated as having a congenital complete heart block .
