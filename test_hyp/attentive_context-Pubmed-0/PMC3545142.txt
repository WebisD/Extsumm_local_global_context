cataract surgery following penetrating keratoplasty is a safe and effective procedure , with a low but definite risk of corneal graft failure .
a 37-year - old male underwent endothelial keratoplasty in the right eye for primary graft failure following large diameter ( 11.5 mm ) therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty .
this case shows that subsequent intraocular surgery with appropriate precautions can be performed safely in post - dsaek eyes .
the graft clarity recovered in 1 month after the surgery . at 3 months postoperative visit ,
however , the long - term effect on the endothelium and graft survival needs to be better understood .
considering the patient 's age and the absence of significant cataract , simultaneous cataract surgery was deferred .
however , the safety and efficacy of intraocular intervention in eyes that have undergone dsaek is not well established .
the specific surgery - related issues to be considered in these eyes are : the site of internal incision in relation to the edge of the lamellar graft , turbulence during insertion of the phaco handpiece with irrigation , which can potentially lead to graft dislodgement , reduced working space in the anterior chamber , and endothelial cell loss during surgery .
