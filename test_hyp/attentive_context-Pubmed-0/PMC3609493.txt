the expression of this gene is modulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 ( 33 ) . in this study , a positive correlation between cdkn1a and igm antioxldl ab was found in opa . in conclusion , the results of this study show that the gene expression of the apoptosis , lipid metabolism , and inflammation metabolic pathways in the fv and opa vessels is directly related to the levels of igm antioxldl ab . because this is a cross - sectional study , we could not determine whether igm antioxldl ab has a proinstability effect in plaques , whether it exerts a protective compensatory response , or whether it is merely a correlative marker for the presence of inflammatory cells in patients with diabetes .
clinical and biochemical variables from patients with paod in addition , we investigated the possible correlation of plasma igg and igm antioxldl ab levels with gene expression of different biomarkers ( mrna levels ) in patients with paod .
we demonstrate that in both a vein and an artery , plasma levels of igm antioxldl ab correlate with these signaling pathways , indicating that this antibody was expressed in a determined environment ( atherosclerotic medium ) independently of the analyzed vessel
