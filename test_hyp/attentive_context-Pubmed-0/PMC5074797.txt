our data suggest that the vegf gene -460 c > t polymorphism is related to the risk of cscc , and both vegf gene -460 c > t polymorphism and -1154 g > a polymorphism are correlated with the prognosis of cscc patients .
therefore , the vegf gene -460 c > t polymorphism and -1154 g > a polymorphism may serve as a potential genetic marker for the risk and prognosis of cscc .
the relationship between vegf gene -460 c > t polymorphism , -1154 g > a polymorphism , and the survival of patients with cscc was examined for the first time .
this study aimed to further clarify the potential association of these 2 snps with the cscc risk and to evaluate the prognostic impact of vegf - related snps on cscc patients .
the c allele frequencies in the control group and patient group were 66.53% and 80.50% , respectively ; while the t allele frequencies in the control group and patient group were 33.47% and 19.50% , respectively ; the differences in the 2 groups were statistically significant ( t vs. c , or=0.48 , 95%ci : 0.310.75 , p=001 ) . comparing the genotype distributions of the vegf gene -1154
