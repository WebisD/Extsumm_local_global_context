in this study , we compared the efficacy of ss exercises with strengthening of abdominal and trunk muscles ( st ) on pain , functional capacity , and tra activation capacity in individuals with clbp .
all variables significantly improved with treatment ( p<0.001 ) , with the exception of tra contraction ( p  =  0.99 ) .
therefore , the sample consisted of 30 patients ( four men and 11 women in each group ) with nonspecific clbp .
all variables significantly improved with treatment ( p<0.001 ) , with the exception of tra contraction ( p  =  0.99 ) .
both treatments were effective in relieving pain and in decreasing functional impairment , but only the ss treatment improved tra muscle activation .
it is estimated that over 70% of adults have at least one episode of low back pain during their lifetimes.2 prevalence is higher in young , economically active adults in south american populations;3 indeed , low back pain is the second most common reason for absenteeism from work , and one of the most common reasons for medical consultation.4   one important risk factor for low back pain is weakness of superficial trunk and abdominal muscles,5 - 9 and strengthening of these muscles is often associated with significant improvements of clbp , as well as with decreased functional disability.10 - 15 another independent risk factor for clbp is the weakness and lack of motor control of deep trunk muscles , such as the lumbar multifidus ( lm ) and transversus abdominis ( tra ) muscles.16,17 ferreira et al.18 and hodges et al.19 demonstrated that the tra had insufficient control and speed of muscle contraction delayed in individuals with clbp .
