in the absence of an efficient adaptive immune response due to hiv - driven impairment , uncontrolled inflammation can result in lung immunopathology , and consequently , the host may induce tissue repair responses . the shift from m1 to m2 m program may become pronounced and prolonged in the sterile attempt to restore tissue integrity , elevating the level of il-10 that is typical of disease progression by both pathogens , and thus contributing to the failure of all immunological functions and clinical collapse . while highly speculative , this scenario highlights the importance to understand m polarization in the context of immune activation and pathogen - driven disease , and its potential to be yet another convergence point targeted by mtb and hiv to circumvent the host immune system .
chief among these strategies is the prevention of the inflammatory response or seizure of the anti - inflammatory mechanism in place to protect tissue integrity .
pathogens have evolved ingenious strategies to circumvent the host immune response as part of the constant evolutionary process - taking place in all living organisms .
given the pivotal role ms play as sentinels of the immune system , they represent ideal cell targets for subversion by successful intracellular pathogens . priming stimulus for the classical ( m1 ) and alternative ( m2a - c ) activation of macrophages .
