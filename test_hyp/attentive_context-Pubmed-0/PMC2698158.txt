technical limitations were encountered when using tae for the management of hepatic arterial bleeding . however , in the other locations , tae seems to be effective and safe for the control of arterial bleeding after ldlt .
in contrast , surgery did not lead to the detection of any bleeding focus in the three remaining patients . in conclusion ,
between april 1999 and march 2001 , 32 ( 26 men and 6 women ; age range , 7 - 62 years ; mean age , 43 years ) of 195 patients who had undergone ldlt underwent 42 sessions of conventional arteriography in search of bleeding foci of arterial origin within 6 months of the operation .
however , in three sessions , additional immediate surgery had to be conducted following successful tae for the evacuation of hematoma .
surgical bleeding was one of the most common causes of bleeding after ldlt , however , iatrogenic bleeding was even more common than surgical bleeding in our retrospective study .
clinical observation may be sufficient whenever the patient 's condition tolerates it . in our study , four patients with hematochezia or melena showed negative outcomes on arteriography , but improved clinically without surgery or tae . in fact , tae was very effective in cases of positive arteriography , and all four patients with arteriographically proven gastrointestinal bleeding improved after only one session of tae . in the conventional arteriogram , a negative outcome does not always guarantee the absence of actual bleeding . in our study ,
