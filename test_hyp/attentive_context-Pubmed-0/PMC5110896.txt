. herein , we present a rare case of iac with its multiple radiologic modality findings that suggests a benign rather than malignant feature on initial ultrasonography ( usg ) and mammography and the pathologic correlation .
, radiologists should consider the malignant potential of newly developed nodule and evaluate the lesion pathologically despite the benign feature seen with radiologic imaging modalities .
a 61-year - old woman presented to our hospital due to an abnormal finding on screening mammography .
malignant apocrine lesions of the breast include apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ ( adcis ) and invasive apocrine carcinoma ( iac ) ( 1 ) .
there are few case reports on radiologic findings of iac , but all cases show comparable malignant appearance to idc ( 5 - 8 )
the patient had a history of excision and biopsy on her left breast 9 years before that confirmed fibroadenoma in our medical center .
in addition , it did not contain microcalcification in mammography , as in previous cases . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report on iac presenting as non typical malignant feature . in conclusion
chest computed tomography ( ct ) showed a mild enhanced lesion in the upper center and outer portion of the right breast , but there was no evidence of lung metastasis ( figure 3 ) .
