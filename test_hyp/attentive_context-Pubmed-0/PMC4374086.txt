we asked other parents of children with autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) and many had observed similar changes while taking antibiotics . in fact , we discovered , much to our surprise , that many parents of autistic children routinely give their children antibiotics to improve their symptoms .
further , i reviewed the medical literature and found a single relevant paper that described a clinical trial that gave vancomycin , an antibiotic that is not systemically absorbed when taken orally , to a small group of severely autistic children as part of a clinical research study at chicago rush children 's hospital ( 2 ) .
there is compelling evidence of a link between autism and the microbiome in at least a subset of children .
it is difficult to think of another medical condition with such a wide and growing prevalence that science can not say what it is : neurological , genetic , infectious , autoimmune , metabolic ? all of the above ?
i was determined to better understand this phenomenon because i believed that if we could understand the biological basis of his improvements , we might gain insight into how autism works and be able to help him . to try and understand the link between autism and antibiotics
