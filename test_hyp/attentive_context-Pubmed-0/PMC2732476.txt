the results of our analyses are consistent with the findings of michel et al ( 3 ) , who demonstrated a higher incidence of human stec infection in rural areas of ontario , as opposed to urban areas , and a spatial association between the incidence of human stec infection and cattle density .
of these 33 , 9 ( 27.3% ) were based on the number of beef cattle , the total number of cattle per ccs , and measures of manure application ; 4 ( 12.1% ) were based on the number of standardized animal units per ccs ; and 1 ( 3.0% ) was based on both the number of dairy cattle and chickens per ccs .
the nested means techniques , stec incidence rates were classified as very low incidence ( 0.00 to 0.95 per 100,000 ) in 204 ccs areas , low ( 0.96 to 4.54 per 100,000 ) in 95 , average ( 4.55 to 5.38 per 100,000 ) in 15 , high ( 5.39 to 15.01 per 100,000 ) in 78 , and very high ( 15.02 to 77.52 per 100,000 ) in 41 .
the multivariate model having the highest r value , shown in table 4 , consisted of humbcow ( the ratio of the number of beef cattle to the human population in a ccs ) , pigfarm ( the total number of swine per km of farm land in a ccs ) , smanccs ( the proportion of land in a ccs in which manure is applied by a solid spreader ) , and lsmancrp ( the proportion of cropland in a ccs in which liquid manure is applied to the soil surface .
