, we could show that hco extended dialysis is very effective in lowering elevated myoglobin in rhabdomyolysis .
even the elevated amitriptyline clearance by hco membranes in the context of extended dialysis is unlikely to confer a clinical benefit , supporting a recent recommendation of extrip to refrain from any ectr in intoxication with tcas . as a finding unrelated to the topic of extracorporeal toxin removal
antidepressants represent the sixth leading substance category causing intoxication in the usa , with tricyclic antidepressants ( tcas ) being the most important category in that group .
we report two cases of amitriptyline poisoning in which we measured the amitriptyline elimination using a high cut - off ( hco ) dialyzer .
similar findings are reported all over the world : amitriptyline is the second most responsible drug for death in antidepressant poisoning in the uk , where antidepressant self - poisoning is used in 20% of all poisoning suicides .
the extracorporeal treatments in poisoning ( extrip ) workgroup therefore recommends not to use extracorporeal removal of tca , as this approach is not likely to offer a clinical benefit .
the potential benefit of modern means of renal replacement therapy was suggested in a report on haemodiafiltration after acute amitriptyline intoxication in which the patient showed an improved vigilance during treatment . as no amitriptyline blood concentrations
