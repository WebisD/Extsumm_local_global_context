the po and popen amongst the mature adults in kosovo seems to be quite low , and together with the relatively high levels of pa ( amongst the study participants ) , allows us to believe that this population stands a solid position against age related msh conditions such as osteoporosis and osteopenia .
42% of total participants met the diagnostic criteria ( 20 ) of osteopenia ( 18.8% of males and 51.3% of females ) , out of which ( total subjects ) 6.8% are on the verge of getting osteoporosis ( with t - score below -2 ) with menopausal woman being at the greatest risk ( 11.6% ) .
the same situation was encountered within males ( consumers versus non - consumers ) in bmd , t - score , z - score and hand grip , whereas significantly better results were recorded in all variables in females . when dividing the a02b drug consumers into two subgroups : ppi and h2 receptor antagonists , significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) impact on bmd , t - score , z - score and hand grip isometric strength had ppi usage comparing to h2ra , but nevertheless this was nt the case when comparing each of these groups with the rest of this study subjects ( non - consumers of a02b ) ( table 4 ) .
