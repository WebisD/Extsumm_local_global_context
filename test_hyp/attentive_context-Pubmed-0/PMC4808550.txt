it is extremely important to understand the mechanisms responsible for the disrupted influence of t3 hormone on cells of renal cell carcinoma because of its role as a cancer regulator and its link to therapy with sunitinib and other multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) is defined by the national cancer institute ( nci ) , as the most common type of kidney cancer , which develops in the lining of the renal tubules of the kidney .
it is known for a long time that t3 has high impact on cancer development and maintenance ; however , there is no fundamental and comprehensive analysis of the role of thyroid hormone in different populations of cancer . of course ,
what is more , based on these and many other publications it is possible to design and perform functional analysis of the tr1 in different populations of cancer , representing primary tumor , metastatic tumor , and cancer stem cell populations of rcc .
although novel treatment such as using sunitinib significantly prolongs time to progression , the overall survival of patients diagnosed with rcc is still not satisfactory , which justifies the search for new methods and therapy targets , for which it is necessary to understand the mechanisms responsible for the development and progression of this cancer .
