we present a case of a patient in whom calcified injected collagen showed imaging features mimicking ureteral stone .
a 15-year - old girl presented with moderate degree of right flank pain for 2 weeks .
bulking agent injection is now a standard treatment for patients with grade 1 - 3 primary vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) .
this is the second case report of ureterovesical injection calcification presenting as a ureteral stone during differential diagnosis and the first report of its imaging .
collagen , however , can get calcified in the tissue , a process that can cause a series of problems for patients .
the standard treatment for grade 1 and 3 primary vur is injection of a bulking agent into the uvj .
collagen has been used for many years as a bulking agent in ureterovesical orifice and bladder neck to treat vur and incontinence .
a kidney ureter bladder ( kub ) radiography was requested and the report indicated presence of bilateral ureteral stone [ figure 1 ] .
clinicians should be aware that calcification of bulking agent like collagen can occur and they need to differentiate this from ureterovesical stones on imaging findings .
