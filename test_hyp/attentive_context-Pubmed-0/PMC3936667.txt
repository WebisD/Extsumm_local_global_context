suprabasal expression of ck 4 and 16 and pattern of shifting to surface layer in ck 10 , compared with ras , possibly indicate the altered differentiation and hyperproliferation of cholesteatoma .
histopathologically , basal cell hyperplasia , appearance of suprabasal cells with new proliferation capacity are observed in cholesteatoma , resulting in disruption of epidermal homeostasis between proliferation and terminal differentiation rate.2 - 4 ) involucrin is precursor of human cornified envelope and can be a marker for the intermediate stage of squamous differentiation.5,6 ) filaggrin is a major component of keratohyalin , and is concerned with differentiating of granular and corneal layer.7,8 ) cytokeratins ( ck ) are known to be insoluble proteins that form the intermediate filaments of mammalian cells , and have been introduced as markers of cellular proliferation.9,10 ) the aim of this immunohistochemical study is to determine whether the hyperproliferative and hyperkeratotic characters of cholesteatoma are associated with differentiation of keratinocytes in cholesteatoma in comparison to retroauricular skin ( ras ) , by examining the localization of marker proteins , such as involucrin , filaggrin , and cks , which is typically expressed in different steps of squamous epithelial differentiation .
overexpression of involucrin and fillagrin presumed that early differentiation of suprabasal layer , especially upper spinous and granular layers in cholesteatoma , may lead to hyperdifferentiation and hyperkeratosis .
