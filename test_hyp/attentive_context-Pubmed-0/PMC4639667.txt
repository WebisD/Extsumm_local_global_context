hence , the present study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of t. crispa stem extract on renal damage and hemolysis induced by p. berghei infection in mice .
taken together , our results suggest that t. crispa stem extract shows protective effects against p. berghei - induced renal damage and hemolysis .
appropriate pharmaceutical strategies might now be devised to increase the low bioavailability of this extract and to protect against rapid in vivo metabolic transformation , in such a way to make them more amenable as alternative antimalarial drug in combination therapies .
the onset of renal damage and hemolysis in icr mice infected with pbanka come out from day 4 after infection and the incidence of renal damage and hemolysis were confirmed through manifestations such as increasing of bun and creatinine as well as decreasing of % hct in infected mice .
next , we observed that bun and creatinine levels were markedly increased in infected mice , and first significant ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 ) increases were found on day 4 after infection ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) .
hemolysis was observed in untreated control and infected mice treated with 500  mg / kg of the extract as indicated by decreasing of % hct with significance ( p < 0.01 ) , compared to normal control .
