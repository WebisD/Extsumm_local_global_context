in conclusion , the measurement of iop while positive power cls having a water content of 58% , such as those in etafilcon a , are worn , tends to give lower values than those obtained without cls .
the comparison between measures obtained with the + 2.00  d and + 6.00  d cls was not significant . in order to evaluate
none of these parameters correlated with the difference between iop values obtained with + 2.00  d and rt or + 6.00  d and rt .
the correlations between iop measurements without cls and with the positive cls were  >  0.9 ( p  <  0.05 in all cases ) .
mean of intraocular pressure without cls and with + 2.00  d and + 6.00  d was 19.0    4.1  mmhg ( range : 9.027.5 ) , 17.6    4.6  mmhg ( range : 10.525.0 ) and 17.8    4.1  mmhg ( range : 10.824.8 ) respectively ( fig .
altman plots for the comparison between the measurement with + 2.00  d cl and without cl ( rt ) and the measurement with + 6.00  d cl and without cl respectively are shown in figure 2 , figure 3 .
it has been shown that with the rebound tonometer it is possible to measure iop over soft cls , either hydrogel or silicone hydrogel , with good clinical accuracy.39 , 40 however it has been found that the type of material and the power of the cl can cause an underestimation of iop or overestimation.25 , 42 the aim of this study was to verify this effect not only for a + 2.00  d cl but also for a higher positive + 6.00  d cl .
