similar to females with earlier menarche , the trajectory to earlier sexual maturation in males is manifested by faster weight gain from birth and faster growth from early childhood and leads to higher adult bmi , greater lean mass , and greater abdominal fat mass , with potential relevance for adult health . in studies where direct assessments of pubertal development are not available , conditional
males with more advanced voice breaking at age 14 yr also showed a trend toward greater whole - body fat mass ( p = 0.1 ) , specifically greater android fat mass ( p = 0.02 ) , and a greater android to gynoid fat mass ratio ( p = 0.02 ) ; they also had greater waist circumferences at age 53 yr ( p = 0.002 ; table 3 ) .
yr , when body composition was assessed by dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) , more advanced voice breaking at age 14 yr was associated with greater whole - body lean body mass ( p = 0.002 ) and a trend toward greater appendicular lean mass ( p = 0.07 ; table 3 ) .
our new parameter , conditional hd - sds , designed to correct the bias inherent in ( unconditional ) hd - sds ( 17 ) , showed a pattern of associations with childhood and adult weight and height that was more consistent with the other physical markers of pubertal maturation at age 14 yr ( table 5 ) .
