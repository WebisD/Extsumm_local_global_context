the following research hypotheses were tested : ( 1 ) the 
 storage temperature can influence the flexural strength of the composites tested ; ( 2 ) 
 the flexural modulus of the composites stored at different temperatures will be inferior 
 to that observed at room temperature ; ( 3 ) the energy dose influences the mechanical 
 properties of the composites , irrespective of the storage temperature .
the aging protocol improves the flexural strength of filtek p60 and filtek silorane , 
 whereas storage in the oven at 37c for 24 h impacts the same parameter for all of the 
 composites tested .
this study evaluated the mechanical properties ( flexural strength and flexural modulus ) 
 of different classifications of composites indicated for posterior application as 
 functions of the storage condition ( room temperature , aged , oven , refrigerator , and 
 freezer ) and the energy dose .
all the composites exhibited significantly decreased in the 
 s means when the syringes were stored in the oven at 37c for 24 h 
 compared to that of at rt ( p<0.05 ) . on the other hand , the simplified protocol of 
 accelerated aging led to a significant increase in the s means for p60 
 and for filtek silorane ( p<0.05 ) .
