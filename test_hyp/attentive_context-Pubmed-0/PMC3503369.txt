summary of key facts on pon1 expression , activity , and effects in in vitro and in vivo studies
summary of allele differences of pon1 in vitro , and conclusions from pon1 human studies recent human studies on the role of pon1 in cvd some alleles of polymorphous genes can be causative factors in development of diseases and reliable predictors .
also , transfection of pon1-deficient peritoneal macrophages ( isolated from pon1 knockout mice ) with human pon1 decreased level of peroxides , lowered release of superoxide , and increased intracellular level of reduced glutathione , key observations are summarized in table 1 .
currently , analyses of association of pon1 polymorphism with atherosclerosis - related diseases determined just one reliable association , an association of q192r polymorphism with ischemic stroke .
after the introduction of the oxidative stress hypothesis of atherosclerosis and the discovery of antioxidant effect of high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) , pon1 attracted significant interest as a protein that is responsible for the most of antioxidant properties of hdl .
transient overexpression of pon1 in mouse demonstrated beneficial effects of pon1 beyond its antiatherogenic properties .
some in vitro data suggest that antioxidant activity might be related to other components of purified pon1 preparations .
