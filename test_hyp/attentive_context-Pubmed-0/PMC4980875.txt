this involves bladder closure shortly after birth , followed by epispadias repair at 6 - 12 months of age and bladder neck reconstruction at 4 - 5 years of age . to assess the success of staged reconstruction of the be and its effect on the upper urinary tract , we have analyzed the renal function and continence in 30
the modern staged repair offers a low risk of renal scarring with acceptable continence opportunity with acceptable cosmetic appearance of external genitalia in the males and females .
therefore , whichever treatment modality is chosen for the newborn with be ; modern type of staged reconstruction , bladder , and urethral closure by penile disassembly in the newborn or urinary diversion , follow - up must be careful and into and including adulthood . in our experience ,
classic bladder exstrophy ( be ) is a rare malformation of the genito - urinary tract affecting 1:50,000 - 1:100,000 live births .
between 1994 and 2013 , 30 patients with be have been managed at our institute in various stages of repair , 7 were females and 23 were male patients .
of 30 patients 27 patients underwent primary repair and 3 patients were referred for secondary be closure .
