the use of enzyme catalysts ( lipases ) in biodiesel production is being increasingly studied because of the advantages that these catalysts present over chemically catalyzed and noncatalytic processes .
the enzyme - based production of biodiesel is still under development , and it seems that there is a tendency for the use of conventional technologies as a new application for lipases , such as their immobilization in magnetic nanoparticles , microwave and ultrasound - assisted transesterification , esterification in pressurized fluids , and transesterification in supercritical fluids .
some of the advantages offered by the use of lipases are lower energy consumption ; lower thermal degradation of substrates and products ; versatility in the use of raw materials , including possibility to use acid oils without the decrease of process efficiency ; easier purification of the alkyl esters ( biodiesel ) and separation of the coproduct ( glycerol ) , especially if immobilized enzymes or whole cells are used ; environmental benefits , due to biodegradability of the catalyst .  
nevertheless , some process conditions should be taken into account in order to have a feasible enzyme - based technology for the production of biodiesel , and these include the establishment of descriptive correlations between the enzyme dosage and the substrate source , in order to rationalize enzyme usage and optimize costs ; deep study of reaction conditions and their optimization ; the selection of a proper biocatalyst which can be reused and maintain its stability over several cycles ; product recovery strategies , especially when a cosolvent is used in the reaction .
