our aim was to study nutritional intake and growth , with respect to plasma levels of adipokines and neonatal factors , in vlbw school children with and without severe radiographic bpd and term controls .
children with radiographic bpd presented with poorer head growth and a greater incidence of microcephaly at school age than vlbw and term controls .
short stature was found to be negatively associated with the intake of protein ( or = 0.35 ; 95% ci = 0.14 - 0.85 ) , fat ( or = 0.12 ; 95% ci = 0.02 - 0.79 ) , and carbohydrates ( or = 0.37 ; 95% ci = 0.15 - 0.37 ) and positively associated with energy intake ( or = 1.38 ; 95% ci = 1.03 - 1.58 ) .
our hypotheses were that ( 1 ) bpd children and vlbw controls would present with similar growth parameters , but term children would demonstrate better growth than vlbw cases ; ( 2 ) nutritional differences would exist between bpd children and controls ; and ( 3 ) plasma adipokine concentrations would be associated with growth parameters in vlbw children at school age .
in all , 8 vlbw children with microcephaly at school age had smaller age - adjusted head circumferences at birth , with a mean and sd of 0.5 ( 0.86 ) versus 0.39 ( 0.62 ) , and their weight gain during initial hospitalization was poorer , with a median ( range ) of 14.8 g / d ( 14.3 to 20.4 ) versus 22.8 g / d ( 7.0 to 28.5 ) , compared with vlbw children without microcephaly .
