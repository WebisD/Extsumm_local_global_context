however , as noted in the case reported here , a discrepancy between imaging findings suggestive of a submucosal tumor and the biopsy results of the adenocarcinoma may suggest the diagnosis present in this case . although mucosal ulceration can be present in both ebv - associated gastric carcinomas and submucosal tumors , the ulcerated shape of the advanced ebv - associated lesions has been thought to be related to the superficial depressed shape of the early lesions ( 12 ) . in conclusion , the mdct findings of an ebv - associated lymphoepithelioma - like carcinoma that developed in the gastric body presented as an enhancing submucosal mass with abundant lymphoid stroma admixed with adenocarcinoma . because the tumors have unique clinicopathologic features , understanding the imaging findings and clinical features of ebv - associated lymphoepithelioma - like carcinomas
is important in the preoperative diagnosis and in differentiating this entity from other submucosal tumors .
a 46-year - old man was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and management of a gastric lesion that had been detected by gastroscopy during a medical checkup at a local clinic .
it is difficult to differentiate lymphoepithelioma - like gastric carcinoma presenting as a submucosal mass from other gastric submucosal tumors such as a gist , neurogenic tumor , and glomus tumor by imaging alone .
