for patients with medically refractory forms of tn , gkrs has proven to be an effective initial and repeat treatment option .
the goal of this paper is to provide a modern review of the literature thoroughly analyzing the efficacy of gkrs in the treatment of patients with tn , as well as evaluating the treatment planning and methods associated with this evolving modality .
cumulative research suggests that patients treated a single time with gkrs exhibit similar levels of facial pain control when compared to patients treated multiple times with gkrs .
further evidence in the form of a phase iii - randomized trial is needed to confirm the clinical outcomes of patients treated with either modality .
however , patients treated on multiple occasions with gkrs are more likely to experience facial numbness and other facial sensory changes when compared to patients treated once with gkrs .
trigeminal neuralgia ( tn ) is a disorder of cranial nerve ( cn ) v that results in severe episodes of shock - like or lancinating pain in one or more of its three divisions ( v1v3 ) .
although numerous articles have reported mvd to be superior to gkrs in achieving facial pain relief , the findings of these comparison studies are weakened by the vast differences in patient age and comorbidities between the two studied groups and can not be considered conclusive .
