ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( vps ) is a well - established cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) diversion procedure in cases of hydrocephalus .
there are a lot of complications associated with this procedure and shunt extrusion via different natural orifices is one of them .
optimal management plan in such type of cases either uncomplicated or complicated is laparotomy and removal of the shunt with added appendicectomy .
the incidence of perforation is inversely related to the mobility of gut , and colon is the most frequently perforated viscus due to its immobility .
a 10-month - old male child presented with protrusion of shunt tubing from the anus , incidentally noticed by his parents .
a number of complications associated with this procedure are mentioned in literature with abdominal complications accounting for 1030% of all .
. such type of case should be consider in special category in which shunt removal without proper surgical exploration and added appendicectomy may be quite difficult and hazardous for the patient .
the first case of anal extrusion of distal vps was reported by wilson and bertan in 1966 .
the patient had a history of excessive cry along with extrusion of shunt tube through anal orifice [ figure 1a ] .
