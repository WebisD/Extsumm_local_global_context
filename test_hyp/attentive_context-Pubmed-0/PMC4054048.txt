under the limitation of this in vitro study it can be concluded that : 
 the self - etching adhesive , clearfil s bond , provide prompt bonding to dentin treated with different disinfectants compared with , adper single bond 2 , the etch - and - rinse adhesive alternative.the use of the tested dentin disinfectants before the acid etching step negated the bonding performance of the tested etch - and - rinse adhesive . 
  the self - etching adhesive , clearfil s bond , provide prompt bonding to dentin treated with different disinfectants compared with , adper single bond 2 , the etch - and - rinse adhesive alternative . the use of the tested dentin disinfectants before the acid etching step negated the bonding performance of the tested etch - and - rinse adhesive .
regression analysis for the different variables mean and standard deviations of micro - shear strength values in mpa of all tested groups in general , use of disinfectants increased the bond strength when clearfil s bond was used compared with the control specimens .
the null hypothesis examined first ; there is no differences in the -sbs between both etch - and - rinse and self - etch adhesives , second : there is no difference in the -sbs between control and differently disinfected dentin surfaces with both etch - and - rinse and self - etch adhesive systems .
