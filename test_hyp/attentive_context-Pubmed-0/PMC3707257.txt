the ability of padma 28 to increase angiogenic activity of lymphocytes may partly explain its beneficial effect on regenerative / repair processes , but for this purpose this remedy should be used in evidently lower doses than these recommended by producers , for avoiding deterioration of granulocyte function .
the effect of padma 28 ( 0.085 or 5.8  mg ) supplementation of balb / c donors on the angiogenic ability of their splenic lymphocytes to induce newly formed blood vessels in the skin of f1 ( balb / c  c3h ) recipient mice is presented in figure 1 . according to one - way analysis of variance the p value < 0.0001
that is why we decided to evaluate in the present study , on the experimental model in mice , the in vivo effect of padma 28 ( in high dose , comparable to that recommended for humans , and in low dose , comparable to these which we used previously in studies of various other herbal extracts ) on immunological angiogenesis and , simultaneously , on granulocytes metabolic activity evaluated by chemiluminescence .
bonferroni test revealed highly significantly statistical increase of blood granulocytes number in the blood collected from mice fed with lower padma 28 dose in comparison to the control ( p < 0.001 ) and significant increase ( p < 0.05 ) in comparison to the group fed with high dose of remedy .
