lag3 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily ( igsf ) and exerts a wide variety of biologic impacts on t cell function.21 lag3 is expressed on cell membranes of natural killer cells ( nk),21 b cells,22 tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes ( til ) , a subset of t cells,23 and dendritic cells ( dc)24 , 25 .
lag3 plays an important role in a variety of autoimmune diseases and promotes chronic infection and cancer .
beyond the role it plays in a variety of autoimmune diseases , lag3 can also reduce the body 's ability to resist infection and promote chronic infection .
lag3 prevents autoimmune disorders in the eye by inducing anterior chamberassociated immune deviation.45 lag3 may regulate the functions of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells during autoimmune diabetes , and limit autoimmunity in diseaseprone environments.46 in bone marrow transplant ( bmt ) patients , lag3 can regulate cd8 + cells involved in alloreactivity , t cell proliferation and activation after bmt.47 , 48 in patients with chronic viral infection , the blockade of both pd1 and lag3 could synergistically activate t cell responses and control the virus.49 lag3 negatively regulates cd8 + t cells in chronic hepatitis c patients.50 in tuberculosis , slag3 is elevated both in healthy people who have been exposed to the bacteria and in tuberculosis patients with good prognoses,51 indicating that slag3 could modulate an antibacterial immune response in mycobacterium tuberculosis.52 in acquired immune deficiency , high expression of lag3 was correlated with impaired invariant natural killer t cell cytokine production for the duration of chronic human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv)1 infection and treatment.53 , 54 targeting the lag3 pathway has an immune regulatory effect and can enhance immune reconstitution in hivinfected patients.55
