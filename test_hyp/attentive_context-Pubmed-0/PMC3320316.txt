in addition , because peak infectivity , as indicated by viral load , usually occurred during week 2 of illness ( 7 ) , when most of the patients would have been isolated in hospital ( the mean onset - to - admission interval decreased from a maximum of 9.3 days in late february to 1.0 day by mid - may ) ( 8) , transmission to close contacts in the later stages of the epidemic was less likely .
our finding of the near absence of transmission resulting in asymptomatic infection in this representative high - risk group of close contacts indicates that the prevailing sars - cov strains in hong kong almost always led to clinically apparent disease .
during the epidemic , close contacts were prospectively identified by the hong kong special administrative region government department of health through standardized telephone interviews with all 1,755 confirmed sars patients within 1 week of hospital admission ( february 15june 22 , 2003 ) .
although our results suggest that sars - cov was a new virus in humans without a close precursor or an antigenically related virus that would have induced at least a small degree of cross - reactivity on serologic testing , a recent study on a select group of 938 healthy hong kong adults , whose serum had been previously stored as part of a hepatitis b serosurvey in 2001 , indicated that 1.8% of the sample had acquired a sars - cov  related virus infection at least 2 years before the 2003 sars outbreak ( 5 ) .
