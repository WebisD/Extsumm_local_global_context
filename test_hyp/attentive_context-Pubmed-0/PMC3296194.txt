however , recent studies showing that the levels of the aicd are increased in brains of ad patients and murine models reproducing the disease , open up the possibility that this fragment participates in the molecular mechanisms contributing to ad .
the app is a type i transmembrane protein with characteristics of an orphan receptor , which shares with other members of its class a particular signaling mechanism termed regulated intramembrane proteolysis ( rip ) .
the last one accumulation and the formation of various aggregates and deposits in the brain have been the main hypothesis to explain the neuropathological development of ad for almost 20 years .
the two hallmarks of ad , the amyloid plaques , and neurofibrillary tangles , which are elegantly related through the amyloid cascade hypothesis , are the main components in the current research on the molecular mechanisms leading to this pathology . since its origin , the amyloid cascade hypothesis has accumulated substantial evidence in its support , which has virtually overshadowed the fact that clinical trials based on this hypothesis have been shown to be unsuccessful .
one of many possibilities to explain the failure of clinical trials could be related with the fact that several mouse models express the human - mutated app found in familial ad , so it is unclear which abnormalities detected in these models are product of specific a species ( like oligomers ) or another toxic metabolites of app ( like aicd ) or simply due to effects of overexpression of happ .
