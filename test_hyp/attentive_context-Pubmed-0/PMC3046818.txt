the hr of cardiovascular events for q121 carriers versus kk homozygotes was 1.47 ( 95% ci 0.802.70 , p = 0.21 ) in the ghs , 2.31 ( 95% ci 1.224.34 , p = 0.01 ) in the tvas , and 1.36 ( 95% ci 0.882.10 , p = 0.16 ) in the creed ( fig .
the addition of the k121q genotype did not improve the risk discrimination provided by the predictive model that included age , sex , bmi , smoking status , hypertension and diabetes , as indicated by the survival c - index , which went from 0.704 to 0.713 ( p = 0.94 ) , or by the idi , with 0.42% improvement ( p = 0.16 ) .
an association between the variant and risk of events was present among the 159 subjects who had a bmi 30 kg / m ( hr 3.56 [ 95% ci 1.2110.5 ] , p = 0.02 ) , but not among the 171 individuals who had a bmi < 30 kg / m ( 0.91 [ 95% ci 0.402.06 ] , p = 0.82 ; p = 0.039 for interaction ) . no evidence of gene - by - obesity interaction was instead observed in the tvas ( p = 0.53 ) and the creed ( p = 0.41 ) .
