domain variability of the ventilatory variables ( respiratory rate , minute ventilation and tidal volume ) in healthy individuals during progressive cardiopulmonary exercise tests performed on cycle and arm ergometers .
the time - domain ventilatory variabilities of young , healthy , sedentary individuals was greater during the maximal graded exercise test performed on the arm ergometer when compared to the leg ergometer . the mechanisms that influence ventilatory variability during exercise remain to be studied .
the timing of breathing was not influenced by the type of exercise performed when dynamic arm and leg exercises were compared .
all of the tests were maximal , with a respiratory quotient greater than 1.1 ( table 1 ) .
figure 1 shows there was no difference in the timing of breathing throughout the exercise when both ergometers were compared ( p>0.05 ) , but the analysis in table 2 shows greater time - domain variability in the ventilatory parameters during arm - crank exercise than during leg exercise .
the analysis of the results of this study shows that the type of exercise ( dynamic leg or arm exercise ) does not influence the timing of breathing during maximal progressive exercise tests , even during maximal ventilation .
