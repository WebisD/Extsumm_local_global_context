papers have been published with both satisfactory91011121314 and unsatisfactory results using bha.5151617 the main limitations sighted are migration of the outer cup ( secondary to the acetabular erosion ) and unpredictable pain relief.3514 incidence of groin pain varied from 11.5% to 42%181920 and incidence of acetabular erosion and protrusio is reported to range from 0% to 45%.1819 the activity of the patient and the duration of followup determine the erosion of acetabulum and appearance of symptoms.21 however , the main issue seems to be motion between the outer cup and the acetabulum , a nonconcentric acetabulum and particulate wear.16222324 to decrease this motion between the outer cup and the acetabulum a gentle reaming of the acetabulum with insertion of tight fitting acetabular cup can be done as suggested above by bateman and giliberty.78 this is thought to decrease the incidence of groin pain and the acetabular erosion and also revision secondary to these issues.2526 in this retrospective series , we have assessed the midterm outcome of bha in young adults ( age < 60 ) with ficat stages 3 and 4 avn .
this procedure can be used for treatment in young adults with ficat stages 3 and 4 avn of the femoral head to defer a definitive tha .
