two male patients with type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) and coronary heart disease had plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) and n - terminal probrain natriuretic peptide ( nt - probnp ) measured as part of routine evaluation .
these findings posed the question as to why it is that in some patients the plasma levels of cardiac natriuretic peptides ( cnp ) are unexpectedly low , and what is their value in the prognosis for these patients ?
a cnp deficit in patients with components of the metabolic syndrome might be of clinical relevance .
the cnp act as a basic functional link between cardiovascular system homeostasis , inflammation and certain metabolic functions ( fig .
together , these data suggest that a cnp deficit , as observed in obese patients with the metabolic syndrome , contributes and aggravates metabolic vascular disease , and thus , prognosis .
the glp1 receptor agonist liraglutide , which is widely used for the treatment of t2d , has been shown to induce cardiac anp release in mice , leading to enhanced natriuresis and vasodilatation ( 128 ) without inducing congestive heart failure .
insulin has been observed to induce nprc expression in human adipocytes ( 84 ) and monocytes ( 83 ) , and might , hence , link conditions associated with hyperinsulinemia ( e.g. obesity and insulin resistance ) , to a relative np deficit
