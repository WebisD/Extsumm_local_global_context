students ' perceptions of attitudes of faculty within a medical school towards rural health may be changed positively as a result of the introduction of a rural health placement to the curriculum .
the aim of this study was to test whether students ' perceptions of faculty and peer attitudes towards rural health at the dunedin school in 2007 had changed compared to those of the original cohort .
further research is required to identify features of rural health placements leading to such changes before these findings can be generalised .
we did not supply a definition of urban and rural : students self - identified into urban and rural groups ( in 2000/2001 , 24% of students were self - identified as rural ) .
these changes are important and add to the effort at undergraduate level to increase rural workforce numbers .
our hypothesis was that student pre - course perceptions of faculty and peer attitudes towards rural health might be more favourable in 2007 than earlier , as a result of the increased focus on rural health within the school following the introduction of the original course .
the study was a comparison of data from a census of the 2007 cohort of 5th year medical students at each of the three clinical schools of the otago university medical school and data from an earlier census of the cohort of dunedin 5th year medical students from 2000 and 2001 .
