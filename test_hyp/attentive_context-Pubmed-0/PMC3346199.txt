most anticancer agents used in tace are hydrophilic and usually prepared as emulsions mixed with iodized oil before intraarterial administration.3 these hydrophilic agents may cause rapid release of the active anticancer components in the bloodstream after they accumulate in the target lesions ; therefore , these agents may not be expected to yield persistent and sufficient anticancer drug levels in the plasma against tumor growth.4 miriplatin ( miripla ; dainippon sumitomo pharma , osaka , japan ) is a third - generation platinum derivative and has been developed recently for transarterial treatment of hcc.5 unlike other hydrophilic anticancer agents , miriplatin contains myristates as lipophilic side chains , which combine with the carrier ligand of platinum ; therefore , it is easily dissolved in iodized oil without the need for emulsification.6 following intra - arterial administration , the miriplatin - iodized oil suspension accumulates in the target tumor , and continuous antitumor effects caused by gradual release of active platinum compounds are expected.68 in an early phase ii trial , 56% of the patients treated with miriplatin via transarterial chemoinfusion therapy were shown to achieve a complete response without major adverse events.4 in a randomized late phase ii study in patients with unresectable hcc , the miriplatin suspension demonstrated similar therapeutic efficacy to a zinostatin stimalamer suspension ; further , it caused less hepatic vascular injury than the latter.9 these clinical studies suggest that miriplatin is a promising alternative to conventional hydrophilic chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or doxorubicin for treating unresectable hcc .
