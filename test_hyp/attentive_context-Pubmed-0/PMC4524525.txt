we also examine how old and new classification systems align with patients and their pcps perceptions of copd severity .
the goal of these changes was to improve the clinical assessment and management of copd.17 since the introduction of the new gold assessment system there has been interest in understanding how it compares to the traditional spirometry - based staging system , but most studies to date have been conducted with copd patients recruited from university specialty clinics or research cohorts enrolled in longitudinal studies.1829 very few studies have been based on primary care copd populations.30 understanding how the new gold copd assessment system relates to the older spirometry - based severity system is a practical problem for primary care practitioners ( pcps ) who need to be able to rate the severity of their patient s lung disease and communicate that to the patient and to other health care providers.31 the primary objective of this analysis is to examine in a primary - care - based cohort how copd patients staged by the traditional gold spirometry - based severity system are reclassified by the new gold 2011 assessment systems . because the history of exacerbations is an important component of the new gold system , the severity stages and assessment groups are further stratified by exacerbation history .
