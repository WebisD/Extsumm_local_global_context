however , only 31 ( 10% ) of those were in the untreated subgroup , as compared to 141 ( 46% ) in the 7 to 10 days treatment subgroup , 98 ( 38% ) in the 4 to 6 days treatment subgroup and 98 ( 33% ) in the 1 to 3 days subgroup , a statistically significant difference among the all treatment subgroups ( p  <  .0001 ) .   attempting to elucidate the possible causes for the differences between the recurrence of gabhs and the length of antibiotic treatment or clinical score on enrolment or illness severity , a multivariate stepwise logistic analysis was performed .
a more judicious use of antibiotics would promote and improve compliance , cut costs , and prove more convenient to parents and children alike .
the goal of this study was to determine whether noncompliance with antibiotic treatment affects short - term or long - term complications .
furthermore , despite the poor compliance , we found no increase in the incidence of acute rheumatic fever , the most dreaded complication of gabhs , in our patients .
110 ( 5.5% ) children developed cervical lymphadenitis , most ( 52 , 47% ) among the 6 to 7 days treatment subgroup and 33 ( 33% ) among the 4 to 5 days treatment subgroup , a significant difference among the treatment subgroups ( p < .0001 ) .
