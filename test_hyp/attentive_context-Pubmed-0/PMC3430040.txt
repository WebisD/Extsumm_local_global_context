, we concluded that same concentration of epidural levobupivacaine with fentanyl has less arrhythmogenic but similar analgesic potential than bupivacaine in major abdominal surgeries . with regard to the safety of the s - isomer of bupivacaine
18 g tuohy needle was introduced in the midline at the lumbar 3 - 4 or 4 - 5 interspace with the patients undergoing low anterior resection for rectum cancer and at the thoracal 7 - 8 or 6 - 7 interspace with the patients undergoing total gastrectomy for stomach cancer .
postoperative satisfaction with the epidural analgesia was similar with median scores of 69 ( levobupivacaine ) and 73 ( bupivacaine ) ( vas ; 100 mm = extremely satisfied ) in the first 24 hour after operation .
additional analgesic need was 25 ml for group i and 30 ml for group ii ( p = 0.185 ) .
postoperative incidence of ventricular arrhythmia ( va ) , conduction abnormalities and pauses longer than two seconds were similar in both preoperative and postoperative period ( p > 0.05 ) .
total analgesic consumption was 145 ml for group i and 150 ml for group ii ( p = 0.091 ) .
