the impression of acute retinal necrosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor by detecting herpes simplex virus type 2 ; therefore , the patient received intravenous acyclovir .
the patient had multiple foci of retinitis in the retinal periphery associated with vitritis , blot retinal hemorrhage and retinal arteriolitis .
herpetic encephalitis may be a risk factor for acute retinal necrosis . the virus may reach the eye by the trans - axonal route .
a young man was referred with a chief complaint of blurred vision and pain of the left eye 1 month after herpetic encephalitis in the left frontotemporal lobe .
acute retinal necrosis ( arn ) is one of the clinical presentations of herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) .
acyclovir used as prophylaxis for recurrent genital hsv infection in adults for 5 or more years has been associated with minimal toxicity and the selection of resistant strains has not been demonstrated , but there is little experience with the duration of prophylaxis that would have been necessary to prevent arn in our patient . with this report
other articles report that the virus accesses the retina from the brain by the trans - axonal route ; consequently , this virus can cause recurrent episodes of arn   . these reports may necessitate a prophylaxis with antiviral agents after herpetic encephalitis to prevent arn . in a study by pavsio et al . , the role of long - term prophylaxis with acyclovir in children who had herpetic encephalitis is an important issue .
