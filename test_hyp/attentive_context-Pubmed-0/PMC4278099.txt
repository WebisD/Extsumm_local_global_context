proximal embolization of the ma was considered unsafe for tumor extirpation , but embolization of both sphenopalatine arteries was a useful tool in the management of epistaxis .
a pre - operative routine angiographic study in a patient who presented with a nasopharyngeal angiofibroma revealed an m - oa anomaly .
documentation of this tumor entity and m - oa anomaly , both relatively rare , remains a valuable contribution to the literature .
the m - oa anomaly followed distinct patterns of orbital supply and was the sole supply to the eye . in this particular case , the m - oa anomaly was not tumor related and was considered incidental .
upon reviewing the literature , it was found that nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and meningo - ophthalmic artery ( m - oa ) anomaly are relatively rare phenomena . in denmark ,
embolization of the external carotid artery ( eca ) is a useful tool in the devascularization of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and in the treatment of epistaxis .
a 12-year - old boy was admitted to our academic hospital and diagnosed with nasopharyngeal angiofibroma . computed tomography ( ct )
tumor extirpation is the mainstay treatment , but the recurrence rate ( 20% , ranging between 5 and 50% ) remains a challenge for the surgeon . in the case of m - oa anomalies , the ophthalmic artery ( oa )
