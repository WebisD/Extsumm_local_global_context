overall , our findings agree with the results of earlier investigators who reported no adverse effects associated with fish consumption [ 22 - 24 ] and support the voluminous body of literature denoting gestation , male sex , parity , cigarette smoking , placental infarction , and birth defects as determinants of fetal growth and birth size .
in addition , we attempted to assess risks posed by such chronic low levels of exposure by estimating the effect of fish consumption on the proportionality of birth size .
consistent with this exposure scenario , we undertook a study to assess consumption of contaminated fish and birth size in the context of other determinants of gestation and fetal growth .

* p < 0.05 no significant mean differences in any measure of birth size ( including percentiles , ratios or indices ) were observed across categories of fish consumption and gestation .
we are using fish consumption as a proxy for pcb exposure while simultaneously assessing the effect of fish consumption on pregnancy outcomes such as gestation and birth size .
