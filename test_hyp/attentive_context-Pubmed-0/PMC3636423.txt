the universal problem of how to select among the promising approaches and candidate vaccines is particularly acute in china .
nevertheless , the basic research problems are being tackled with some enthusiasm and creativity , and the new 5-year program to improve tb control that was announced by the chinese ministry of health on 1 april 2009 will have an impact .
there has been a striking upsurge in tuberculosis ( tb ) vaccine research in china in recent years .
, we can note that there are at least two additional restricting factors limiting the progress of the field in china : few research groups have access to facilities for safely working with animals infected with a dangerous pathogenic organism such as the tubercle bacillus ; infrastructure for undertaking vaccine clinical trials to international standards is sparse . in consequence ,
the potential benefits of adding immunotherapies / therapeutic vaccines to tb chemotherapy have been recognized in china , but both preventive and therapeutic approaches against human tb await development of clinical trial capacity for their proper assessment .
researchers are now able to exploit cutting edge technologies in designing new tb vaccines and are increasingly able to test the vaccines in relevant animal models of infection .
