two different methods were used to quantify the expression of tpm1 and tpm1. we determined the absolute copy number as well as relative expression compared to a reference gene ( 18s rrna ) in mouse heart and skeletal muscle . unlike in humans ,
, we are unsure whether the absolute overexpression of human tpm1 and/or its altered exon 2a protein relative to the mouse sequence explains the dcm - like phenotype observed in transgenic mice . obviously , one should consider creating transgenic mice with mouse tpm1 to better understand the physiological relevance of tpm1 protein .
, we report the expression of tpm1 in mouse heart and skeletal muscles . to the best of our knowledge ,
hence , we decided to explore tpm1 expression in mouse hearts by rt - pcr and sequencing . in this study
the expression level of tpm1 transcripts in mouse heart is much lower compared to tpm1. further , there are three amino acid changes in mouse relative to human tpm1.
cdna sequencing confirmed the expression of both tpm1 and tpm1 expression in mouse heart and skeletal muscle .
both the rna and protein of this sarcomeric tm isoform is expressed in both heart and skeletal muscle in axolotl .
