the eurodia database has been built using gene expression data analysis interface ( gedai ) , a flexible framework for storing , analyzing and sharing gene expression data and results .
a consortium of recognized european experts in the field of t2 dm initiated eurodia , an integrated project devoted to understanding the biology of the pancreatic beta - cell .
the eurodia database has been developed as a tool to integrate heterogeneous gene expression datasets , to enable sharing of data and to provide efficient analysis methods to mine the information content .
the eurodia database is a unique collection of beta - cell gene expression datasets generated by a consortium of european experts .
having the data repository integrated with the analysis tools also avoids the cumbersome steps of data extraction , reformatting and loading of data into an external tool .
the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying beta cell failure remain poorly understood , limiting the availability of novel approaches to treat or prevent t2 dm . monitoring the transcriptome of functional and disturbed beta - cells might reveal genes and pathways involved in the maintenance of normal beta - cell functional capacity . in march 2006 ,
glucose homeostasis is maintained through the efficient modulation of insulin production and release by the pancreatic beta - cells coupled to a correct response of insulin - sensitive cells to the hormone .
