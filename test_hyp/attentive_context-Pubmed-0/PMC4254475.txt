in our early experience , the robotic - assisted technique is a safe and efficacious approach to colorectal surgery , in addition to preserving oncologically sufficient outcomes .
this study aims to compare and contrast our experience with robot - assisted and laparoscopic approaches to colon and rectal procedures to elucidate any differences in outcomes .
we performed a retrospective review of 40 patients who underwent either standard laparoscopic or robotic colorectal surgery with the da vinci si robot ( intuitive surgical ) at tulane medical center , new orleans , louisiana , between january 2008 and february 2013 .
further investigation into the comparative costs and into the magnitude of the effects in a larger patient population is necessary to better elucidate the differences between laparoscopic and robot - assisted techniques in colon and rectal operations .
the mean age of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery versus robotic surgery was 61.1  10.7 years versus 61.1  8.5 years ( p = .997 ) , the mean bmi was 28.9  6.3 versus 26.2  4.2 ( p = .158 ) , and the percentage with a history of abdominal surgery was 44.0% versus 26.7% ( p = .273 ) . there was a significant difference in terms of sex , with more patients being male and undergoing robotic surgery ( 86.7% vs 52.0% , p = .026 ) .
