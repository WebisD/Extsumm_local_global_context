for example , judging of animals always has a degree of human subjectivity associated 
 with it .
one observation is very interesting , that the showing success achieved by the 
 only possible parental combination which guarantees a palomino foal is disproportionally 
 larger than that seen for registration of foals with the society .
this in turn poses an additional 
 question ; has the society s ideal colour definition been influenced in favour of matings 
 which are most likely ( or even guaranteed ) to produce a palomino foal ?
the reasons for this are uncertain , as there are a range of shades which are acceptable for 
 society membership and a range of parental combinations which can achieve a palomino 
 offspring .
in addition , due to 
 restricted information being provided to the society by owners at the time of registration , 
 only around a third of horses registered with the society met the criteria regarding 
 parental information needed for inclusion in these analyses . despite these possible 
 limitations ,
hence it is possible that some of the animals which could have been prize - winning 
 stock were not given the opportunity to fulfil their potential .
registration details of all 2,431 horses registered with the british palomino 
 society were collected for the period 19832007 inclusive . of these animals ,
