understanding which healthcare interventions were available and how they resulted in improvements in the probability of survival could be important , especially for designing programs in resource - constrained settings where breast cancer case fatality is high and many of the most costly and technology - intensive diagnostic and therapeutic options are not available .
breast cancer is a leading cause of death and disability among women , especially young women , in low- and middle - income countries . though incidence and overall mortality rates continue to be lower than in most high - income countries , case fatality rates from breast cancer are very high .
early detection through the use of mammography , high - quality surgery , and adjuvant therapies including chemotherapy and targeted therapies , such as hormonal therapy and , more recently the her2-directed agent trastuzumab , can be credited for much of the recent improvement in outcome for women with breast cancer in the usa . however ,
these high case fatality rates are likely due to a lack of awareness of the benefits of detection and treatment and a scarcity of adequate facilities for detection and diagnosis , as well as poor access to primary treatment .
