three young men ( case a 19  year - old , case b 21  year - old , case c 25  year - old ) came to our observation for recurrent attacks of migraine - like headache of a pulsating quality and severe intensity , with nausea , photo- and phonophobia , that resolved spontaneously within 12  h if untreated .
we describe the cases of three patients with recurrent episodes of migraine with aura induced by physical activity .
aura is defined as attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms ( visual , sensory and/or speech symptoms ) that last more than 5  min and no longer than 1  h. migraine - like headache usually occurs at the onset , during or follows aura symptoms .
it is well known that physical activity can lead to an aggravation of the intensity of the headache and a primary exertional headache is described in the current ihs classification under other primary headaches as a migraine - like headache unleashed by physical exertion .
since there are many cases described in the literature of migraine with aura triggered only by exercise , to faciliate the diagnosis it may be helpful to specify , in the typical aura with migraine headache comments , that in some cases it can be exclusively triggered by sport / exercise .
