of the diabetic patients admitted , 52.9% were women in comparison to 45.0% of the control group ( p = 0.0003 ) .  
, we hypothesized that we will find substantial number of patients in the internal and the intensive coronary unit ( icu ) wards diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetic patients .
the indications for hospitalization were different between diabetes and controls and between genders : the main difference was in the higher occurrence of hospitalization due to atherosclerotic related diseases  both cardiovascular disease and strokes in the diabetic group versus controls ( 37% versus 27% , resp .
no significant differences in discharge status were noted between the two groups with the majority of patients being home discharged and with a low rate of in - hospital death2.6% control and 2.3% diabetic ( table 4 ) .
we found high percentage of diabetes among the patients hospitalized in the internal medicine wards and cardiac intensive units , reflecting the high prevalence of diabetes in the population .
there was a female preponderance among patients admitted with diabetes 52.9% while only 45.0% of patients without diabetes , hospitalized , were women ( p = 0.0003 ) .
mortality during the first year following discharge was 11.5% in the control versus 13.2% in the diabetic group ( p = 0.48 ) . a high readmission rate for both groups 19.9% and 20.3% control and diabetic group respectively , but there was an inequality between the two hospitals with one hospital demonstrating a significant difference between the two groups in the rate of readmission being significantly higher in the diabetic group during the first year after discharge in comparison to the control readmission rate .
