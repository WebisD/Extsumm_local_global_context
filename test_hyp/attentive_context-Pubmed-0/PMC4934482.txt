. a tof ratio of 1.0 represents complete recovery from paralysis , while residual neuromuscular block ( nmb ) is defined as a tof ratio of < 0.9 ; the latter is associated with impairment in swallowing , airway obstruction , and heightened risk of gastric content aspiration.14,15 in this study , we analyzed and compared the costs and the recovery times after sugammadex or neostigmine administration , and estimated the time of operating theater occupancy ( time from 
the clinical application of a tof - driven protocol to reverse neuromuscular paralysis in morbidly obese patients should be encouraged .
starting anesthesia  to when the patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit [ pacu ] ) , in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery .
the sugammadex dose used to reverse neuromuscular paralysis was 258.8 ( 58.4 ) mg ( table 2 ) , and the mean cost per treatment was  146.7 . in neo group ,
the overall number of elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery performed in our institution ( university of naples federico ii ) from 2009 to 2013 was 321 . in our analysis , we included 99 patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria , allocating them in one of the two groups : in group 1 ( n=50  sug ) , rocuronium administration was used for neuromuscular paralysis and sugammadex was used for reversal ; in group 2 ( n=49  neo ) , rocuronium ( 35 patients ) or cisatracurium ( 14 patients ) were used for neuromuscular paralysis and neostigmine for reversal .
