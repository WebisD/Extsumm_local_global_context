dysphagia can be classified into an oropharyngeal or an esophageal location , and it is caused by neuromuscular motility disorders and mechanical obstruction.1 ) mechanical dysphagia is associated with intrinsic or extrinsic compression , resulting in progressive intolerance to solids . the term , dysphagia aortica , has been used to describe difficulty in swallowing caused by external compression from an ectatic , tortuous , or aneurysmal aorta as a result of age - related degeneration.2 ) dysphagia aortica is classically seen in elderly women with short stature who have hypertension and kyphosis.3 ) we report herein a patient with dysphagia associated with an aortic aneurysm .
an 86-year - old woman presented with worsening nausea and vomiting . because of her progressive dysphagia to solids for the last 6 months , she had ingested only semisolids and liquids .
dysphagia is the subjective awareness of difficulty in the passage of solids or liquids from the oropharynx to the stomach .
although we recommended surgical correction of the aortic aneurysm or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy , the patient declined any invasive procedures and she was transferred to a nursing home on the 12 hospital day .
dysphagia aortica is an uncommon type of dysphagia that is caused by extrinsic mechanical compression .
