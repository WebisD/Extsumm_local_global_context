the purpose of the current study was to examine whether healthier family dynamics were associated with higher resilience , sense of coherence , and optimism among dementia caregivers in argentina .
the primary results of the study found that greater empathy was uniquely associated with greater resilience and was trending in significance with increased sense of coherence . having few family problems was uniquely associated with greater resilience and increased sense of coherence , while greater communication was independently associated with greater sense of coherence .
after controlling for significant demographic and caregiver characteristics , family dynamics explained approximately 32% of the variance in resilience and 39% of the variance in sense of coherence .
this study demonstrated that family dynamics were associated with personal strengths in an argentinian sample of dementia caregivers . in general , greater empathy , more communication , and fewer family problems were unique predictors of greater personal strengths suggesting that healthier family dynamics may be important for caregivers with strong family values . while the findings of this study are preliminary , they in part do suggest that they may be important for informing family systems intervention research for dementia caregivers particularly on increasing empathy and communication and decreasing family problems in the family system .
