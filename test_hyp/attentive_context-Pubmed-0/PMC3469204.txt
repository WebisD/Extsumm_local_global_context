thus , this study compared the effects of fermented and nonfermented mung bean extracts on normoglycemic , glucose - induced hyperglycemic and alloxan - induced hyperglycemic mice .
the serum antioxidant levels of extracts treated alloxan - induced hyperglycemic mice were also evaluated in this study .
thus , the significant reduction of no by a high concentration of fermented mung bean extract may indirectly help to reduce the damage of -cell .   in this study , fermented mung bean extract further improved the antihyperglycemic effect of nonfermented mung bean extract in both glucose and alloxan - induced hyperglycemic mice .
however , in both glucose- and alloxan - induced hyperglycemic mice , m. charantia , fermented and non - fermented mung bean extracts were able to reduce oral glucose tolerance to prevent drastic glucose increase in the blood .
, our results also showed that fermented mung bean extract was able to reduce the nitric oxide ( no ) level in the serum of the alloxan - induced diabetic mice in a dosage dependent manner .
where ethanolic extract of mung bean showed anti - inflammatory effect and reduced no synthesis in a macrophage cell line .
similar to the effects on serum lipid profile and insulin levels , untreated diabetic mice in group 2 exhibited significantly higher mda and no levels . both m. charantia and
