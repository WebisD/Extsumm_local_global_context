, this secondary angle closure glaucoma and myopic shift resolves rapidly with discontinuation of the medication and management of intraocular pressure ( iop ) with topical therapy .
a 36-year - old caucasian female presented to the emergency department with a one - day history of severe headache , abdominal pain , and decreased vision in the left eye ( os ) .
topiramate is a sulfamate - substituted monosaccharide , used in the treatment of epilepsy , depression , migraine , and neuropathic pain .
furthermore , the medication is associated with drug - induced myopia , due to anterior displacement of the iris - lens diaphragm . in most cases
further analysis of combined - mechanism angle closure is warranted to elucidate whether exclusion of patients with narrow angle glaucoma from topiramate treatment would reduce the occurrence of this side effect .
banta et al1 , sanka et al2 , and rhee et al3 were among the first to report cases of secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with the use of topiramate in 2001 .
while angle closure secondary to topiramate therapy has been widely recognized as a potential side effect of this medication , our report suggests that perhaps baseline ophthalmic examination should be performed prior to initiation of therapy , and that findings of narrow occludable angles should be a relative contraindication to treatment with this medication .
