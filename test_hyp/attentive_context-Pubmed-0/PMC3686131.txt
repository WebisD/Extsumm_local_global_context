, we sought to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of ssa and pla in tle patients undergoing epilepsy surgery .
most patients with pharmacoresistant lesional tle appear to have a favorable outcome following temporal lobectomy , even in the presence of ssa and pla .
clinical observation of patients with insular seizures proven by depth recordings and after cortical stimulation using insular contacts has revealed a high prevalence of somatosensory and pharyngolaryngeal auras ( ssa and pla , resp . ) , including a characteristic sensation of laryngeal constriction ( lc )   . in this study
we performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent surgery for refractory tle at our institution between january 1980 and july 2007 .
the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of ssa / pla as a potential marker of insular epilepsy and thus a predictor of poor response to surgery in tle patients .
this group of patients was composed of 3 men and 8 women with mean epilepsy duration of 27 years ( range 246 ) and
compared to patients without ssa or pla , those with ssa and/or pla were older at surgery ( p = 0.049 ) , had a higher prevalence of early ictal motor symptoms ( p = 0.022 ) , had a higher rate of cns infections ( p = 0.022 ) , and were less likely to have a localizing spect study ( p = 0.025 ) ( table 3 ) .
