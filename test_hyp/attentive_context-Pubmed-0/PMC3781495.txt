we conclude that stress - induced hyperglycemia increased the risk of ami in patients with hip fractures .
the incidence of ami in the stress hyperglycemia group was significantly higher ( 12.46% [ 75/602 ] ) than in the non - hyperglycemia group ( 6.41% [ 42/655 ] , p < 0.05 ) .
the number of amis was correlated with the occurrence of hyperglycemia and was significantly higher 3 days after injury in the hyperglycemia group ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas the temporal distribution of ami in the non - hyperglycemia group was not different between 3 and > 3 days after injury ( table 2 ) . in all patients with ami
repeated anovas showed that at each time point in the stress hyperglycemia group , the blood glucose values were significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas in the non - hyperglycemia patients , they did not change ( p = 0.10 ) ( fig .
in addition , our study showed stress hyperglycemia ranges of 6.19.7 mmol / l after hip fractures for the first time , and we recommend that stress - induced hyperglycemias after hip fracture should be identified early .
