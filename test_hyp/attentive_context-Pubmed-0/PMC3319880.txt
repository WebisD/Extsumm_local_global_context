additional risk factors of plph were observed to include female gender , history of headaches , and decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels . finally , within the 24  h following puncture , significant decreases in vmean and vmax were observed in bilateral mcas of patients who developed plph .
transcranial doppler ultrasonography ( tcd ) enables us to assess blood flow in the intracranial arteries non - invasively . assuming that tcd parameters are influenced both by changes in cerebral vessel diameters and by fluctuations in icp   ,
post - lumbar puncture headache was observed in 21 out of 66 patients who underwent dlp ( 32% ) , whereas symptoms of post - lumbar puncture syndrome were not noted in the remaining 45 subjects ( 68% ) . in most patients ( 86% ) , the symptoms manifested on the first day following dlp , on average 17.7    10.2  h after the procedure ( range 744  h ) .
l ) middle cerebral arteries of patients who developed post - lumbar puncture headache ( plph ) and in plph - free individuals in patients who developed plph , bilateral pre - puncture values of vmean and vmax were significantly higher and pi was significantly lower compared to unaffected individuals .
