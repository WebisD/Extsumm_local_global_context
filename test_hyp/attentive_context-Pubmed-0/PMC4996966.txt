infectious disease modelling can provide important and useful data to inform public health policy by improving our knowledge of epidemic disease spread , comparing the impact of potential public health interventions and understanding gaps in existing data used to inform public health decision - making . for models to be most useful ,
collaboration between public health stakeholders and modellers is essential to heighten the transparency and public health relevance of models , to optimize the use of epidemiological data for decision - making , and to develop policies that incorporate scientific evidence to improve the control of infectious diseases worldwide .
, the potential role of mathematical modelling in decision - making for health policy in the realm of infectious diseases is explored , and key reasons why mathematical models have historically not fulfilled this potential are evaluated . to do this ,
for example , in the setting of a high - profile outbreak , the probability of making political gains or alleviating public fears is not objectively quantifiable ( despite their importance to the decision - making process ) , but scientific outcomes , such as potential trajectories of the outbreak under different policy decisions , can be estimated quantitatively with appropriate tools using the best available data as inputs , such as the known incubation period . in the realm of infectious diseases ,
