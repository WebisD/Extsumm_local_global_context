a 59-year - old japanese man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a 7.0 cm mass in the posterior segment of the liver or right adrenal gland in november 2009 .
, whether the lesion is benign or malignant is an important issue but is difficult to determine prior to surgery .
an accurate diagnosis of idiopathic adrenal hemorrhage is quite difficult to make prior to surgery .
it is caused by trauma , stress , sepsis , adrenal tumors , anticoagulation , hemorrhagic disorders and pregnancy .
this mass was discovered when abdominal ultrasonography was obtained to evaluate a weight loss of 8 kg from may to november 2009 .
adrenal tumors associated with hemorrhage primarily include pheochromocytomas , adrenocortical cancers and metastatic lesions from other organs . from a clinical perspective
in fact , his weight loss ceased after he consulted our hospital , and the pivka - ii value also normalized prior to surgery . in conclusion , we report herein a case of idiopathic adrenal hematoma .
some imaging modalities are useful in generating a differential diagnosis , but if the potential for malignancy is not excluded , surgical resection should be taken into consideration .
