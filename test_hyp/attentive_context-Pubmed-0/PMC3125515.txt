thus , dbs could become an exciting method in the treatment of depression and obsessive  compulsive disorder ( ocd ) and offers unique possibilities to gain more insight into the underlying neurobiology of psychiatric disorders .
both clinically and scientifically the most promising method of neuromodulation might be deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) .
deep brain stimulation is a unique and very promising method for the treatment of therapy  resistant psychiatric patients .
it is very important to point out that in the actual stage of research ; dbs for psychiatric diseases is clinical research on therapeutics .
, 2009a,2009b,2009c ) and combining these data with functional neuroimaging in order to map the spatiotemporal unfolding of dbs - elicited whole brain activity will lead to a much broader knowledge on functional and dysfunctional circuits processing affective stimuli revealing fundamental mechanisms of brain function .
thus , dbs could become an exciting method in the treatment of depression and obsessive  compulsive disorder ( ocd ) and offers unique possibilities to gain more insight into the underlying neurobiology of psychiatric disorders .
the main focus of studies on the underlying neurobiology of major depression ( md ) has focused on the description of biological differences between patients and healthy subjects such as alterations of monoaminergic or endocrine systems .
