a young female patient who underwent appendicectomy elsewhere for acute appendicitis presented to us with a persistent enterocutaneous fistula of 6 weeks duration .
while appendicitis in a patient who was previously diagnosed to have ileocaecal crohn 's may be managed with appendicectomy and ileocaecal resection , appendicectomy alone when performed for appendicitis in a patient with unsuspected ileocaecal crohn 's disease could lead to postoperative complications including enterocutaneous fistula .
isolated involvement of the appendix in crohn 's disease is reported to be 0.2% to 1.8% , and is usually associated with ileocaecal crohn 's disease in 25% of ileal and 50% of caecal disease .
she underwent excision of the enterocutaneous fistula and ileocaecal resection , and histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed crohn 's disease . in the postoperative period she received mesasalazine .
she had complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to the acute appendicitis presentation .
our investigations , including a ct scan , suggested the possibility of ileocaecal crohn 's disease .
the possibility of ileocaecal crohn 's disease should be considered in patients presenting with unexplained postoperative enterocutaneous fistula following appendicectomy .
when last seen 2 years later during her regular follow - up , she was found to be in good health .
