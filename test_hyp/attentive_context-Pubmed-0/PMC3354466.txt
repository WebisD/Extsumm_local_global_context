, we present a rare case where myocardial infarction was seen as a presenting feature of an underlying hematologic disease , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ttp ) .
this case highlights the importance of a thorough , yet efficient , clinical evaluation in which the history , physical exam , ecg and laboratory data were needed to make the appropriate triage decision and not miss an unusual diagnosis .
acute coronary syndrome ( acs ) marked by ste on the ecg warrants consideration for emergent cardiac catheterization and possible percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) .
a 48-year - old woman with no known coronary risk factors was transferred from an outside facility to the cardiac catheterization laboratory of our hospital with the diagnosis of ste myocardial infarction for primary pci .
patients who present to the emergency department with chest pain require rapid triage , evaluation and management .
myocardial infarction with st segment elevation ( ste ) on electrocardiography ( ecg ) is a common presentation in emergency rooms across the world .
although cardiac involvement is common in ttp , as an index event it can be misleading . as swift protocols are activated in the emergency room and catheterization laboratories to ensure quality control , it is equally important to integrate all aspects of patient 's clinical and objective data to detect unusual disease entities
