further , a combination of pulmonary endarteritis with a systemic suppuration in chd invites greater attention .
pulmonary arterial endarteritis is a rare event , even in patients with congenital heart disease ( chd ) .
a 4-year - old male child , born from a non - consanguineous marriage , was admitted with the history of fever and progressive right - sided weakness for 1 week and cyanosis noted since 6 months of age .
these low - perfusion areas commonly occur in the junction of gray and white matter , and they are prone to seeding by microorganisms that may be present in the bloodstream . the advent of ct scans and their use in the management of these abscesses has resulted in a fourfold decrease in the mortality rate in patients with brain abscesses , secondary to cyanotic heart disease - from 40%-60% in the pre - ct era to ~10% . the threshold for ct scans in a cchd should be low , and regular ct scans should be obtained to monitor the size of the abscess . in conclusion , this case report aims to highlight the considerable and varied morbidity associated with cyanotic congenital heart diseases ( cchd ) . the presence of a relatively common infectious complication ( cerebral abscesses ) and a rare infectious complication ( pulmonary endarteritis ) in the same child with a cchd ( single ventricle ) validates the need for a heightened clinical awareness and a prompt and meticulous investigational approach for diagnosis and therapy in this group of patients .
