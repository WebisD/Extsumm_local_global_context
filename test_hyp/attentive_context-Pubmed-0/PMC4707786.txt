the present study was undertaken to study the cytomorphological features of lch , along with the differential diagnoses so that a rapid and accurate diagnosis on fine - needle aspirates can be made .
seven cases of lch diagnosed on fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) over a period of 10 years ( 2004 - 2013 ) were retrieved from the archives .
a high index of suspicion , awareness of cytological features of lch , and the diagnostic pitfalls hold the key to an accurate diagnosis .
langerhans cell histiocytosis ( lch ) is a rare disease affecting predominantly children and young adults but can be found in any age group .
areas of necrosis were seen in one case and staining for acid - fast bacilli done in this case was negative ( case 2 ) . on cytology , the diagnosis rendered was lch in all the cases .
to conclude , fna procedure , which is rapid , quick , and easy may be helpful in the early identification of lch patients so that appropriate therapeutic measures are instituted .
all the seven cases were confined to the head and neck region , which included three cases of lymphadenopathy , three cases of scalp swelling , and one case of orbital swelling as shown in table 1 .
