glaucoma is genetically heterogeneous and the detection of susceptibility genes could provide useful information for early diagnosis of glaucoma . to date , over 30 genetic loci for glaucoma have been identified by linkage analysis in multiple pedigrees ; 1012 14 loci of poag , 3 loci of primary congenital glaucoma ( pcg ) , and 1 locus of pigment dispersion syndrome have been designated glc1a - glc1n , glc3a - glc3c , and gpds1 ( with approval from the hugo genome nomenclature committee ) , respectively . among them , glc3a harbors cytochrome p450 , family 1 , subfamily b , polypeptide 1 ( cyp1b1).13 cyp1b1 sapans 8.5 kb on chromosome 2p21 with three exons , and mutation of this gene is a major cause of pcg.10,13 most cyp1b1 mutations are genetic insertions , deletions , or missense mutations , indicating that cyp1b1 is relatively susceptible to recombination events.10 cyp1b1 has also been found to be involved in the development of juvenile - onset glaucoma ( juvenile open angle glaucoma [ joag]).1416 in addition , recent studies have shown that cyp1b1 mutations are related to poag in several ethnic groups,10 and there have been reports of delayed expression of a cyp1b1 mutation and coexistence of pcg and poag in the same pedigree.17,18 these recent studies suggest that cyp1b1 mutations in the glc3a locus may contribute to a broader range of glaucoma phenotypes than the pcg phenotype alone , including ntg . in this study , with prospective snp analysis of the cyp1b1 gene in ntg patients in mind , we performed comprehensive microsatellite mapping in and around the glc3a locus and investigated the disease - susceptibility of this locus in ntg patients .
