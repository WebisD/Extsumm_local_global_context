these somewhat contradictory findings may be explained by the possibility that mci subjects have different patterns of plastic organization during the disease , and that the activation ( or hypoactivation ) of different cerebral areas is based on various degrees of hippocampal atrophy .
obviously , this physiological model needs further evidence supporting the relationship with the clinical symptoms .
if this hypothesis is true , then eeg changes of rhythmicity have to occur non - proportionally to the hippocampal atrophy , as previously demonstrated in a study of auditory evoked potentials ( golob et al . , 2007 ) .
recent postmortem data from subjects  who had been prospectively followed and clinically characterized up to immediately before their death  indicate that hippocampal choline acetyltransferase levels are reduced in alzheimer 's dementia , but in fact they are upregulated in mci ( lavenex and amaral , 2000 ) , presumably because of reactive upregulations of the enzyme activity in the unaffected hippocampal cholinergic axons .
a reasonable explanation is that there is a removal of excitatory , synaptic inputs in intracortical networks which would produce a decrease in synaptic efficacy and functional disconnection of cortical circuits ( steriade , 2006 ) .
