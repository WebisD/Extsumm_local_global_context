 dsrcts are rare tumours of young adults ( mean age 28.3  years ) with a male predominance ( 4:1 ) .  painful abdominal masses clinically predominate .
this is the largest imaging review of dsrct to date in the context of the demographic and clinical data , describing the imaging features on computed tomography ( ct ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , ultrasound and positron emission tomography ( pet ) that are most suggestive of dsrct .
the imaging of 28 patients with biopsy - proven dsrct was referred to the royal marsden hospital soft tissue tumour unit for diagnosis and management over a 21-year period ( from 1st january 1991 to 21st may 2012 ) .
 multifocal peritoneal masses with a dominant soft tissue lesion is a distinctive imaging finding . 
a large desmoplastic reaction differentiates dsrcts from histologically similar round cell subtypes .  despite debulking surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy , median survival from diagnosis is 22.3  months .
our case series of 20 patients , support smaller cohort studies in the characteristic imaging features and the diagnosis should be suspected in adolescent / young males in whom imaging studies demonstrate : diffuse peritoneal involvement with multiple soft tissue lesionsdominant soft tissue lesion measuring at least 5  cm without a visceral organ of origin diffuse peritoneal involvement with multiple soft tissue lesions dominant soft tissue lesion measuring at least 5  cm without a visceral organ of origin supporting ancillary findings include : heterogeneous tumoral enhancementcystic change and calcificationmetastatic spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes , liver and spine these imaging features were not found frequently enough to be characteristic of dsrct , and although their incidence varies throughout the literature , they are in line with smaller cohort groups .
