use of existing breast archival ffpe material is optimized by microdissecting samples to obtain homogeneous histologically defined cell populations from small - volume lesions .
combined , our results show that of the methods tested scomp is the most suitable method for wga of ffpe tissues and delivers results similar to nonamplified samples .
we compared the techniques and tested further the better performing method by a high - resolution acgh .   to initially test the methods , we used better - quality dna extracted from fresh samples and found scomp superior to dop - pcr ( figure 1 ) . to validate the acgh platform before further analysis , we used quantitative pcr ( q - pcr ) and tested 22 genes in the three groups of data  nonamplified , scomp - amplified , and dop - amplified .
acgh analysis showed consistently better performance of the scomp technique compared to dop - pcr . since acgh has been successfully used in breast cancer research to characterize breast cancer cell lines and identify regions of common genomic alterations in different cancer subtypes   , we used current approaches of acgh analysis to study the effect of wga on accurate detection of alterations .
