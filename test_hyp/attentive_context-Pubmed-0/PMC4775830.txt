this article reports the research findings of the interpretive component of the study that answers the research question ,  how do rural radiographers construct ways to negotiate communication and disclosure of their radiographic opinion within their practice world?
a twophase doctoral study was undertaken to examine australian rural radiographers ' and their experiences and perceptions of radiographic interpretation and subsequent disclosure .
in australia , the educational preparation of radiographers for the higher level competencies required in image interpretation and communication of their radiographer 's opinion is currently ad hoc .
awareness of the barriers and enablers of communication in rural radiographic practice will enable a move towards stronger collaborative partnerships between radiographers and their medical colleagues .
it is essential for safe care that communication is open , direct and transparent7 , so that health professional , such as radiographers , do not feel the need to enter into game playing . improving radiographers ' image interpretation skills , and making the communication pathways between radiographers and referrers more explicit , will positively impact on patient care through the timely collegial sharing of knowledge .
this limits radiographers capacity to contribute to patient care and also limits the capacity of the health system to provide higher quality care through interprofessional teamwork .
