soluble oligomers of iapp also have been shown to be responsible for activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome that leads to increased interleukin-1 production in type 2 diabetes ( 22 ) . in type 1 diabetes , similar smaller aggregates of iapp
it is quite conceivable that such oligomers would be taken up by antigen - presenting cells and processed in a way that leads to the formation of neoantigenic epitopes .
, we have provided definitive evidence that diabetogenic cd4 t cells in the nod mouse react to iapp as an antigen , including the identification of a peptide containing a natural ligand for one of these t cells .
such deposits are not found in type 1 diabetic patients , but it has been demonstrated by others that the initial step in amyloid deposition is the formation of toxic iapp oligomers ( 21 ) .
the other indicator that iapp might have a role in type 1 diabetes , and the first evidence from the nod mouse , was a genetic mapping study in which we reported linkage of the iapp gene with the antigen locus for a cd4 t - cell clone bdc-6.9 ( 18 ) .
iapp is of particular interest in this regard because of its propensity to form amyloid deposits in type 2 diabetic patients .
