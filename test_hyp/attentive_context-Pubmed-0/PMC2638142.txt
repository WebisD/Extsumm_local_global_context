we and others have demonstrated that proangiogenic factors , such as vegf and plgf , exert direct proinflammatory   and antiapoptotic effects   . in this regards , the developments of synovial inflammation , hyperplasia , and angiogenesis in the joints of ra patients may all be regulated by vegf . given the importance of vegf in the pathology of ra , antiangiogenic therapies , particularly those involving an anti - flt-1 blocking agents , could when administered as a monotherapy or in combination with other biologic agents selectively ameliorate ra symptoms and reverse its fundamental pathology .
the   pathology   of   rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is characterized by the proliferation of synovial cells and angiogenesis , pannus formation .
the antiangiogenic peptides , rrkrrr and gnqwfi , introduced here represent a promising development in the antiangiogenic field .
we integrate current knowledge concerning how angiogenesis , specifically vegf , contributes to disease exacerbations in ra .
in addition , we present a new therapy for ra based on a synthetic anti - vegf hexapeptide that specifically targets the interaction between vegf and its receptor .
moreover , the pathology of ra suggests that it is unlikely that a single biologic agent that targets a specific subset of immune cells is capable of effecting cure . in this review ,
