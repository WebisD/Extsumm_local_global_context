preparation of this commentary was supported in part by the 6th and 7th framework programme of the european community in the context of the projects ' changing behaviour of health care professionals and the general public towards a more prudent use of anti - microbial agents ' ( champ , contract sp5a - ct-2007 - 044317 ) and ' impact of specific antibiotic therapies on the prevalence of human host resistant bacteria ' ( acronym saturn , agreement fp7-health-2009-n241796 ) .
one of the main study findings is a decreasing rate of methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) and a dramatic increase of third generation cephalosporin ( 3gc ) resistant enterobacteriaceae over the study period . in recent years
in a recent issue of critical care , meyer and colleagues   report interesting surveillance data from icus in 30 german hospitals , based on a large amount of microbiology and pharmacy data gathered between 2001 and 2008 .
3gc : third generation cephalosporin ; esbl : extended - spectrum betalactamase ; mrsa : methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus .
the ecological nature of the data , however , makes it difficult to infer clear cause - and - effect relationships , as does the failure to differentiate between hospital- and community - acquired isolates and clinical versus surveillance cultures .
