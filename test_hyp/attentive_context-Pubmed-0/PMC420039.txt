clinical research in the intensive care unit ( icu ) setting is essential to ensuring that patients are treated with interventions that are both effective and safe .
a comprehensive and systematic approach to the ethical analysis of research benefits and harms by institutional review boards ( irbs ) , called component analysis , was recently proposed .
recently , the us office for human research protections investigated three ardsnet clinical trials for purportedly exposing trial participants to undue risk . during the protracted review , enrollment in the fluid and catheters treatment trial
unfortunately , lack of clarity as to when research risks are acceptable in relation to anticipated benefits has impeded important clinical trials .
the focus is shifted away from the life - threatening complications of the patient 's illness , which are present regardless of whether the patient participates in research , to the incremental risks posed by study participation .
the present commentary provides the reader with a brief introduction to component analysis and highlights its application to icu research .
federal regulation governing ' exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research ' considers research risk on the aggregate , and as a result it imposes considerable restrictions on the conduct of research without consent .
