we report herein the case of a patient with severe uc that had developed during the first trimester of pregnancy and was refractory to combination therapy with high - dose corticosteroids and intensive gma , but was successfully treated with tacrolimus following cesarean section early in the third trimester .
in july 2009 , a 36-year - old pregnant woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of refractory uc .
this therapy ultimately resulted in clinical remission . in conclusion , for pregnant uc patients , combined therapy consisting of high - dose corticosteroids and intensive gma is recommended until it is impossible to prolong gestation any further . when clinical remission can not be obtained , rescue therapy using tacrolimus after cesarean section may be useful .
we report herein the case of a patient with flared refractory uc during pregnancy who underwent a bridging therapy consisting of high - dose corticosteroids combined with intensive gma until it was impossible to prolong gestation any further . at that point ,
in addition , the risk of flare - up and the development of associated inflammation during pregnancy is known to be increased in both the remission and the active stages of inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) , including uc and crohn 's disease .
