as there is limited literature on eegs after first seizure in varying age groups , conducting a prospective study to evaluate the eeg after first seizure is needed . in particular , to assess the influence of the eeg results on treatment decisions , social and emotional implications and seizure recurrence .
if we decide not to arrange an eeg this time and to do so if any further seizures occur , are we practicing evidence based medicine ? a recent guideline published by the royal college of pediatrics and child health ( rcpch ) asserted :  there is no need for an eeg following a first simple afebrile seizure .
the international league against epilepsy suggests that following such a diagnosis , the next step should be the appropriate classification of the seizure type , after which an appropriate syndrome diagnosis should be made .
a child is brought into a pediatric emergency unit with an unprovoked , afebrile first seizure .
we conduct a clinical assessment of the child and rule out any acute metabolic , traumatic or infectious causes and consequently , make the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure .
 this is a very bold and clear statement however , what evidence and what quality of evidence is this statement based upon ? this review analyses and discusses prominent literature regarding this widely - discussed topic .
