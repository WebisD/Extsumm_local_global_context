cystoscopy revealed a normal anterior urethra with a large protruding prostatic mass and normal bladder .
the patient has been followed - up for two years and has no urinary symptoms in this period .
the nuclei of the stellate and spindle cells are hyperchromatic and pleomorphic ; few , if any mitoses are seen and none are atypical . despite the rarity of pfmt , it is important for urologists and pathologists to recognize and be aware of its benign course in order to avoid unnecessary radical procedures .
