increasing thickness reduction reduces lightness and increases a reddish , bluish appearance , and translucency of monolithic zirconia ceramics .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the amount of thickness reduction on color and translucency of dental monolithic zirconia ceramics .
highly significant correlations were found out between tp values and the amount of thickness reduction in all groups ( r > 0.94 , r > 0.89 , p < .001 ) .
one - hundred sixty - five square - shaped specimens from presintered yttria - stabilized tetragonal zirconia blocks ( lot no . : b 105566 , b 105583 , b 105565 , b 88712 ; bruxzir , glidewell laboratories , newport beach , ca , usa ) were colored with coloring liquid ( lot no . : 40127 , 40129 ; tanaka zircolor , a2 , tanaka dental , skokie , il , usa ) and assigned to 5 groups according to the number of coloring liquid application ( group i ( one time ) to v ( five times ) , n = 33 per each group ) following the same protocol used in our previous study.7 the specimens were heated in a furnace ( austromat basic , dekema dental - keramikfen gmbh , freilassing , germany ) with a step sintering procedure ; sintering at 950 for 10 minutes and at 1,500 for 2 hours .
