raccoon dogs are naturally susceptible to rfav infection , and rfav is most likely the etiologic agent responsible for the disease manifestations of the sick raccoon dogs .
we identified a new virus species , rfav , from farmed raccoon dogs and arctic foxes in jilin and liaoning provinces , china .
during july  december 2012 and 2013 , sick raccoon dogs and arctic foxes , which were farmed for fur products on 6 farms ( farms a 
cytosine nucleotide content of 62-bp gap , were recovered , which are consistent with the sequences acquired by sanger sequencing of viral dna amplified from tissues .
we further proved that rfav is the predominant virus in the lesion tissues of sick animals .
this result indicates that the spleen and kidney of the sick raccoon dogs contained viral antigens that share immunogenicity with amdv - g .
we sequenced av7 primer - amplified pcr products of rfav dna from the tissues of 32 animals ( genbank accession nos .
we used indirect immunofluorescence assay ( ifa ) to probe rfav antigens in spleen and kidney of the 2 rfav pcr 
for the raccoon dogs showing similar clinical signs , rate of illness was 4%8% ; death rate was 60% before the age of 4 months ; and rate of illness increased by years on the farms that initially had sick animals . among arctic foxes , signs varied : emaciation and growth retardation in 3-month - old cubs with pale and swelling kidneys in dead foxes ; and severe diarrhea or intermittent tar - like feces in 37-month - old cubs .
