the patient s cornea must be irradiated with a small peak - like sector of the ultraviolet a spectrum ( 370 nm ) with 3 mw / cm irradiance for 30 minutes , which corresponds to a dose of 5.4 j / cm.3 the ultraviolet a irradiance must be checked before each treatment using an ultraviolet a meter to ensure that the optimal irradiance dose is delivered .
we describe how to perform collagen crosslinking in the protocol setting using a slightly modified ultraviolet a dermatological lamp and preparing the riboflavin 0.1% solution inhouse .
in recent years , corneal specialists have shown a fast growing interest in collagen crosslinking using the photosensitizer riboflavin and ultraviolet a light as a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of progressive keratoconus .
the aim of this treatment is to modify the biomechanical properties of the cornea , thus increasing its rigidity and preventing the progression of keratoconus.1 promising results have been published recently , and data from the dresden clinical study have shown stabilization of the disease , even after 5 years.2,3 it is necessary to follow strict treatment settings and patient eligibility criteria to avoid serious ocular side effects .
thus far , we have successfully treated 12 patients with progressive keratoconus using this ultraviolet a lamp and riboflavin 0.1% solution ( figure 4 ) prepared inhouse .
