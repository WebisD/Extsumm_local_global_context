therefore , cre may be useful as a drug for the treatment and prevention of high blood pressure associated with ca - dependent contraction of smooth muscle .
recently , we reported that cr ethanol extract ( cre ) reduces vascular contraction through the inhibition of voltage - dependent ca channels .
cre significantly reduced the magnitudes of transient contraction by pe and caffeine , suggesting cre inhibits ca release from the sr by blocking the ip3-induced ca release and ca - induced ca release mechanisms .
these contractions were significantly reduced by 1.9  2.2% , 5.8  4.1% , 8.3  6.3% , 11.4  4.4% , 22.3  1.9% , 24.8  6.2% , and 29.7  3.8% ( same respective cacl2 concentrations ) with cre - pretreatment ( figure 2 ) . to discern the effect of cre on the l - type calcium channel , the influence of the l - type calcium channel blocker nifedipine ( 100  m ) or verapamil ( 1  m ) , and the l - type calcium channel activator fpl64176 ( 10  m ) on vasorelaxation of cre against pe - induced contraction of aortic rings was measured .
presently , fpl64176 induced contraction , which plateaued at 3.75  0.22  g in 30  min , was inhibited by 2.4  0.1  g with preincubation of cre ( figure 3(b ) ) . to assess whether cre is involved in ca release - mediated vasoconstriction from intracellular stores , the transient contraction by pe or caffeine was examined in cre preincubated aortic rings .
