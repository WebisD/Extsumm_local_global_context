while the results of this case study identify critical themes of migrant farmworker health among a small , rural population of farmworkers in southern georgia , the salience of invisibility , isolation , and limited access to healthcare has been noted in several previous studies .
as with all case studies , our ability to generalize the findings of this case study to other cases is limited .
it is important that future studies be conducted that employ a variety of methodologies to strengthen the body of knowledge of migrant farmworker health , which in turn will inform interventions and policy decisions .
multiple theories have been proposed to understand the health of migrant workers , with several focusing on the health of migrant farmworkers in particular . while certain aspects of these theories capture elements of the health concerns voiced in this case study , they all fail to capture the impact of isolation from family and community , as well as the invisibility of farmworkers before institutions .
this paper utilizes narrative analysis of a case study to illustrate , through the relationship of the narrator to migrant farmworkers and the participant observations of the co - authors , how isolation from family and community , as well as invisibility within institutions , impact the health and well - being of migrant farmworkers .
