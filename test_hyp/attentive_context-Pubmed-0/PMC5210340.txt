the early varc2 safety end point occurred in 14.3% of patients treated with the lotus and 14.6% of patients treated with the edwards sapien 3 prosthesis with no difference in crude ( hr , 0.97 ; 95% ci , 0.611.56 [ p=0.915 ] ) and adjusted ( hr , 1.03 ; 95% ci , 0.641.67 [ p=0.909 ] ) analyses ( figure  1 ) .
in a nationwide registry , no statistical difference was found between the repositionable lotus valve system and the balloonexpandable edwards sapien 3 prosthesis with respect to the varc2 early safety outcome for the treatment .
we therefore performed an adjusted comparison of the lotus valve system with the balloonexpandable edwards sapien 3 prosthesis in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing tavi within the nationwide swiss transcatheter aortic valve implantation registry ( nct01368250 ) .
the need for new permanent pacemaker implantation was more frequent among patients treated with the lotus valve .
