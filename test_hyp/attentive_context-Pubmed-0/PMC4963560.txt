we conducted a study to identify the facilitators and barriers to linkage to hiv care among the fsws who tested positive in order to design appropriate hiv interventions for this key population group .
our study of facilitators and barriers to linkage to hiv care among female sex workers in kampala and wakiso districts in uganda shows that health system and social network factors are the major facilitators and barriers to linkage to hiv care .
these findings call for a need to design interventions that utilize a multichannel , multipronged approach to increase access to hiv services among fsws .
good quality health services ( especially polite and caring providers , strong follow - up structures using peer educators , and provider telephone calls ) and social network factors ( encouragement from peers and membership of savings group and the need to maintain good health ) were the primary facilitators of linkage to hiv care among fsws . on the other hand , perceived stigma ,
hiv programs for fsw should focus on enhancing these as well as dealing with the barriers that mainly stem from stigma , ignorance , and work - related challenges .
our study shows that fsws ability to be linked to hiv care is largely influenced by good quality friendly services and community support systems especially from their peers .
