we found that ee not only induces an earlier recruitment of mpfc , but also induces the progressive activation of a distributed cortical network that is not activated in standard housed mice .
a recent study showed indeed that cortical tagging seems to be highly specific for precise memory trace and the impairment of early cortical tagging tampers with the postacquisition hippocampal - cortical dialogue , preventing the formation of remote memory .
c57bl/6 mice , housed in standard or in enriched condition , were subjected to spatial learning and then tested up to 50 days after learning to evaluate consolidation process . using the expression of c - fos protein as an indicator of neuronal activity in a brain - wide manner we have found indications for a difference both in the time course and in the network of cortical areas recruited for recent and remote recall between ee and non - ee animals .   in agreement with previous studies
moreover , they demonstrated that early tagging triggers specific signaling cascades , leading to histone - tail acetylation in the cortex and that the histone deacetylase inhibitor improves remote memory retrieval .
many studies point out that the privileged final storage site for remote spatial memories is the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) and in particular the medial pfc ( mpfc ) , including the anterior cingulate , prelimbic , and infralimbic cortices   .
