furthermore , we showed that ventricular orexin levels were not correlated with mean sleep latency , suggesting that orexin deficit might not be involved in daytime sleepiness in pd.11 thus , the clinical expression of orexin deficit in pd remains unknown.12 the objective of this study was to determine whether orexin - a levels in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) from pd patients were correlated with rem sleep without atonia .
orexin - a levels did not correlate with total sleep time ( p = 0.23 ) , rem duration ( p = 0.45 ) , or rem latency ( p = 0.66 ) .
the loss of rem atonia in patients with higher orexin levels illustrates the complexity of the symptoms induced by altered orexin neurotransmission in pd.28 experimental trials of orexin antagonists could be of interest in the transgenic mouse model of rswa .
sleep disorders and diurnal sleepiness are frequent in parkinson s disease.1 polysomnography studies have shown rapid - eye - movement ( rem ) sleep dysregulation with rem sleep onset on diurnal naps2,3 and loss of muscle atonia,4 which is defined as  excessive amount of sustained or intermittent elevation of submental electromyographic tone or excessive phasic submental or limb electromyographic twitching.4 loss of rem atonia is a core phenomenon of rem sleep behavioral disorder ( rbd),5 a condition characterized by vigorous and injurious motor behaviors during rem sleep.6 the orexin system plays a key role in rem sleep regulation .
