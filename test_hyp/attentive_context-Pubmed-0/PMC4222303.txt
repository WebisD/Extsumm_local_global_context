here , we describe a case of a hispanic male with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura induced by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) . the patient was a 21-year - old latino male who presented to the emergency department reporting a five day history of nausea , vomiting , and decreased urine output .
nonetheless , because of the widespread use of nsaids and the high mortality associated with undiagnosed ttp , we present this case - report to shed light into a possible , unknown association between ibuprofen and ttp .
the patient reported that symptoms began shortly after a purposeful consumption of a large quantity of ibuprofen ( 600-mg pills ) in a suicide attempt .
our patient presented with clinical symptoms that included altered mental status , acute renal dysfunction , thrombocytopenia , and evidence of red blood cell fragmentation .
psychiatry also evaluated the patient and concluded that the suicidal incident was rooted to an adjustment disorder .
other possible disease entities were considered but excluded such as hemolytic uremic syndrome ( no history of diarrhea and negative e. coli 0157h7 study ) , autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( coombs test was negative ) , disseminated intravascular coagulation ( coagulation factors were normal ) , hiv , and absence of other known drugs .
