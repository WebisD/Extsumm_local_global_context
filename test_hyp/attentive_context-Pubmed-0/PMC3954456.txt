in 
 summary , we have elucidated the effect of linking hydrophobic 
 organic cores to the 3- and 5- ends of the dna components 
 used in the assembly of smdh2 materials .
herein , we present a 
 detailed computational study , supported by 
 experimental results , which suggests that both the hydrophobic nature 
 and the flexibility of the organic core play very important roles 
 in the self - assembly of smdh2s into cyclic dimers and higher - order 
 nanostructures . while duplex alignment may be important , the interactions 
 between the cores and the dna duplexes to minimize their sasa comprise 
 a dominant force that can not be ignored , especially when there is 
 restricted flexibility . indeed for cyclic dimers involving core 3 , when the cores are attached to the 3-ends of the 
 dna component strands , they prefer to insert into the minor groove 
 of the dna duplexes in the product dimers to minimize their sasa . 

computational 
 results indicate a high correlation between the linkage type ( 3 
 or 5 ) and the final sasa of organic cores that can be attributed 
 to the extent that the cores can insert into the dna minor grooves 
 in the duplex arms of the resulting smdh2 . while 3-linked 
 organic cores can insert almost perfectly into the minor groove , 5-linked 
 cores can only insert partially , resulting in less - stable dimers ( i.e. , 
 with higher sasa ) .
