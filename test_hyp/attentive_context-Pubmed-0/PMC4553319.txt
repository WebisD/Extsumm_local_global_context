the aim of this review is to discuss the immunogenicity , safety , and tolerability of 4cmenb vaccine in infants and toddlers , and the efficacy of different vaccination strategies .

 neisseria meningitidis is one of the most frequent causes of meningitis and septicemia worldwide   , being not only responsible for 1020% of specific meningococcal - related mortality but also the cause of ( particularly pediatric ) long - term morbidity   as it leads to permanent neurological sequelae and disabilities in an additional 20%   .

 n. meningitidis is still one of the major causes of sepsis and meningitis among children worldwide and is associated with a high mortality rate .
considerable efforts have therefore been made to prevent meningococcal disease by means of vaccination , and two effective conjugate vaccines have recently been licensed and led to good results ( men c and menacyw ) .
some large - scale randomised phase iii studies were planned in order to assess its efficacy and describe adverse reactions , but due to the rarity of the diseases caused by n. meningitides serotype b ( which have annual rates of 0.55 per 100,000 people ) laboratory - based methods were developed with the aim of predicting the vaccine 's effectiveness and coverage . in europe ,
