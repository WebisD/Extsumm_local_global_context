most notably , in the case of capnothorax which resolves spontaneously as time goes on , the unnecessary insertion of a chest tube may be avoided by observing alterations in the lung point sign .
capnothorax due to co2 during laparoscopic surgery is rare , but , it has been described as a complication of almost every type of laparoscopic surgery [ 1 - 3,6 - 8 ] .
, the lung point sign may predict the range and amount of pneumothorax during laparoscopic surgery .
a 40-year - old woman , 169 cm , 57 kg , underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy due to an adrenal pheochromocytoma .
when pneumothorax is suspected , it is traditionally diagnosed by portable chest radiography in the operating room .
however , chest radiography may take a considerable amount of time and demonstrates a sensitivity of 31.8 - 75.5% for the diagnosis of pneumothorax [ 10 - 12 ] .
patients under general anesthesia may develop pneumothorax due to a variety of reasons , such as barotraumas , rupture of the lung bullae or needle insertion into the pleural cavity .
in many different fields , lung ultrasonography is often used to diagnose pathological conditions of the lung . in particular , ultrasonography has received attention as a very effective method for confirming pneumothorax at the bedside in the operating room . in numerous studies ,
