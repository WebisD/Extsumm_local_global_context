menopausal women had worse indicators of disease severity ( fibrosis : p < 0.001 ; activity : p = 0.045 ) and reduced response to treatment ( p < 0.001 ) compared to reproductive aged women .
further grouping of female patients according to ( 1 ) treatment ( combined interferon and ribavirin therapy ) response ( nonresponders : patients who had detectable hcv rna at weeks 12 , 24 , and 48 ; relapsers : patients who had detectable hcv rna 24 weeks after stopping treatment ; and responders : patients with sustained virological response ( svr ) with undetectable hcv rna six months after stopping treatment ) , ( 2 ) viral load ( < 600,000 and 600,000 ) , and ( 3 ) fibrosis stage ( f2 and >
the study of menopausal patients included one patient who showed relapse in response to treatment with hormonal levels ( e2 = 97.3 , tt = 29.00 , and prg = 0.60 ) . 

we observed that lower estradiol level is significantly related to fibrosis severity in chc females , while higher total testosterone and progesterone levels are significantly related to fibrosis severity in chc menopausal females only . besides
