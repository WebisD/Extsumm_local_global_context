in many ways , cidp resembles a chronic form of gbs.10,14 cidp differs from gbs in that few patients recall preceding infections or other triggering events . also , unlike the putative role of antiganglioside antibodies in some gbs variants ( e.g. , aman ) ,
this can only be achieved with the use of frequent monitoring of patients ' responses and periodic re - assessments of therapeutic efficacy .
no single major target antigen(s ) has been identified in cidp.14,23 nevertheless , plasma exchange ( plex ) , which presumably removes autoantibodies , complement , and cytokines / other soluble factors , is very effective in cidp as well as in gbs , with many patients responding within a few days.10,2326 reports of clinical improvement after the use of immunoadsorbents to selectively remove immunoglobulins in small series of cidp and gbs also suggest a direct role of autoantibodies in these conditions.27,28 the importance of autoantibodies may also be supported by reports that some mmn and cidp patients improve with the anti - b cell antibody , rituximab,8,29 although this effect was not observed in all studies.30 antibodies against peripheral myelin proteins including neurofascin and contactin-1 , pmp 22 , and p0 ; nodal proteins including gliomedin ; and/or gangliosides have been reported in sera of cidp patients.3141 antibodies against any individual defined antigen are relatively infrequent in any particular series , however , and in the majority of cidp patients the antigenic target is unknown.14,23 animal studies , including induction of cidp - like experimental
