the present study indicated the protective efficacy of glp against etoh induced gastric ulcer in sd rats .
recentiy , pharmacopuncture treatment has been widely used and different types of herbs have been found to be effective for treating various diseases . this study was accomplished to investigate the effect of ganoderma lucidum pharmacopuncture ( glp ) in treating chronic gastric ulcer induced in rats by using ethanol ( etoh ) .
the rats of the control group showed loss of mucosa , but compared with control group , the mucosal losses were less in the np and the glp groups ( fig .
the level of bax protein was increased in the control group , but in the np and the glp groups , the level of bax protein were decreased compared with the control group . especially in the glp group ,
the np and the glp groups had reduced areas of gastric ulcer formation when compared with the control group ( fig .
this conclusion was based on gross appearance , histology , and immunohistochemistry staining for bax , bcl-2 and tgf-1 .
this indicates that tgf-1 expression is part of the normal healing response of gastric tissue . in this study , the level of tgf-1 was significantly increased in the glp group ( figs .
