scge assays confirm the occurrence of efficient cleavage of highly compacted intracellular dna by a light - activated c - lysine acetylene conjugate .
the aim of this work is to test the efficiency of our light - activated ds - dna - cleavers towards intracellular dna using single cell gel electrophoresis assay which can measure dna damage in individual eukaryote cells   .
this result provides a key mechanistic link between efficient dna cleavage and significant cytotoxicity in cell proliferation assays .
tail moment values are also consistent with different levels of dna damage . after confirming that assay conditions work in the control cells , we proceed to investigate dna damage induced by conjugate 3 in lncap cancer cells . to find whether uv itself or thermal reactions of compound 3 may be responsible for the dna cleavage in cancer , we included two control experiments with cells exposed to uv for 10 minutes in the absence of a dna - cleaver ( figure 3(f ) ) and with cells treated with 50  m of compound 3 for 4 hours without photochemical activation ( figure 3(g ) ) .
as expected , while scge assay with healthy cells showed no tails indicative of dna damage , the assays with the damaged cells produced characteristic tails , the size of which correlates with the extent of dna damage in these cells .
