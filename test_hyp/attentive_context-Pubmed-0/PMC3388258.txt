the purpose of this study was to compare these novel parametric pti images with late gadolinium - enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( lge - cmr ) imaging , an established method for quantifying scar size and a marker of viability .
the values of ptf and pti for predicting myocardial viability in all 736 segments were comparable ( auc 0.87 , ci 0.830.90 , and 0.86 , ci 0.820.91 , respectively , p  =  0.541 ) .
atf values remained relatively constant , except for a significant decrease in the ( near ) transmurally enhanced segments ( p  <  0.001 by anova).table 2segmental pet / ct and lge dataextent of lge ( % ) control
mbf was able to predict myocardial viability with less accurate ( auc 0.69 , ci 0.630.75 , p  <  0.001 ) .
