high ct calcium scores in this cohort of intermediate to high ( framingham score ) risk patients correlated strongly with the subject 's global burden of the cad as derived by the ss , more so for subjects with very high scores . similarly , high ccs predicted significant stenosis at both individual and arterial levels ; also , the arterial vessel scores correlated strongly for any lesion but only weakly for the presence a significant stenosis . in spite of this association between ccs and the flow - limiting disease on conventional angiogram , a proportion of patients may still have insignificant disease when ccs is between 350 and 1000 .
hence , contrast computed tomography coronary angiogram ( ctca ) is more accurate than coronary calcium score ( ccs ) in diagnosing or excluding a significant coronary lesion , and it is considered appropriate to perform a ctca in low and intermediate pretest probability ( ptp ) patients based on their age , gender , and symptoms .
the correlation between ccs and significant stenosis is moderate ( r = 0.3 , p = 0.005 ) for the whole cohort , but become insignificant when analyzed separately for the high and very high ccs groups . in the roc analysis , an individual 's calcium score of 777 has a sensitivity and specificity of 77% to predict a flow - limiting lesion [ figure 3 ] . coronary calcium score versus significant lesion at patient level coronary calcium score versus significant lesion at patient level . both high and very high coronary calcium score group
