we herein describe the case of a man with recurrent episodes of bilateral focal myositis .
focal myositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and a rare inflammatory pseudotumor of the skeletal muscle with unknown etiology ( 1 ) .
a 38-year - old man presented with myalgia of the right gastrocnemius muscle in may 2005 . a needle biopsy of the muscle was performed in another hospital and indicated no malignancy .
this myositis can be treated successfully with steroids or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) ( 1,2 ) .
further studies are needed in order to clarify the sparing effect of treatment via mtx in steroid - resistant cases of focal myositis .
the majority of focal myositis cases involve a limited lesion , and bilateral lesions are rare . in our case ,
the differential diagnoses of inflammatory myopathy were postulated to be polymyositis , dermatomyositis , inclusion body myositis , eosinophilic myositis , and sarcoidosis .
the disease typically disappears spontaneously , does not last more than 4 years , and has no recurrence ( 1,2 ) .
although the present patient demonstrated a good response to steroid treatment , psl dose reduction induced the recurrence of myalgia . because he experienced repeated myositis
