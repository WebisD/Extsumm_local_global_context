to our knowledge , this is the first report on internal mammary lymph nodes as a site of late and very late solitary ovarian cancer recurrence and on the determining role of pet / ct scan for the diagnosis of isolated tumor involvement and therapeutic decisionmaking . surgical dissection or radical radiotherapy
recently , we have observed internal mammary lymph node metastases diagnosed by f - fdg - pet / ct as a solitary recurrence site in 3 ovarian cancer patients .
we have been unsuccessful in finding reports on internal mammary lymph nodes metastases from ovarian cancer in the recent literature . in this case report , we have presented 3 cases of recurrent ovarian cancer in which pet / ct detected internal mammary lymph node metastases as unique site of disease , 6 , 9 and 11 years after the primary surgical operation , respectively . in the first and third case ,
recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma has a poor prognosis and is almost always fatal   .
the pet / ct scan has enabled a local therapeutic approach : a surgical treatment in two patients and radiation therapy in 1 patient , permitting a local control of the disease . at , respectively , 4.5 , 8 and 2 years after the diagnosis of internal mammary lymph node metastases our patients are still alive .
