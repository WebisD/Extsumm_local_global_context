in this study , two aspects of our smartphone - based ras application 
 were investigated : ( 1 ) the effects of various ras tempos on stroke gait patterns and ( 2 ) the 
 effects of short - term gait training on spatiotemporal gait parameters in stroke 
 patients .
m / min , f=34.219 ) and cadence 
 ( 53.73  6.5 steps / min , f=114.253 ) increased significantly , while gait cycle duration ( 1.13 
  0.16  s , f=150.236 ) decreased significantly compared to baseline ( p < 0.05 ) . in the + 10%

 ( 46.30  5.35 steps / min , f=114.253 ) , stride length ( 1.27  0.17 m , f=12.082 ) , step length on 
 the affected side ( 0.65  0.09 m , f=14.026 ) , and step length on the unaffected side ( 0.61  
 0.1 m , f=13.066 ) decreased significantly compared to baseline ( p < 0.05 ) .
