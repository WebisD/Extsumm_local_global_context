a new form of rosehip powder has enhanced in vitro anti - inflammatory and chondroprotective properties in human peripheral blood leukocytes and primary chondrocytes .
three different pcas were run , illustrating the global effects of rh - a and rh - b on pbls at the protein and gene level and on nhac - kn gene level .
given the demonstrated health benefit of rose hip in clinical studies ( for review see , e.g. , ) , we hypothesize that in clinical studies rh - b is more efficacious or can be used in lower doses than rh - a in the treatment of oa conditions . indeed , a recently completed randomized active - controlled trial provided evidence that , taken at half the original dose , the novel enhanced rosehip powder ( rh - b ) had similar effects in patients with symptomatic oa as the original rosehip product ( rh - a ) .
, the rh - b counterpart had a stronger impact on the expression of inflammatory genes .
the current study aimed at the identification of biological activities of different parts of the rose hip fruit and an improved use of rose hip preparations in the management of oa conditions .
