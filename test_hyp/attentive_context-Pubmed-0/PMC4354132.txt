, we aim to clarify the tpa - independent roles of neuroserpin in the cns .
neuroserpin , or proteinase inhibitor 12 ( gene symbol serpini1 ) , was first found in cultured chicken neuronal axons and is predominantly expressed in human neurons of both the central and peripheral nervous systems .
neuroserpin also has roles that are independent or partly independent of its tpa inhibitory capacity . in this review
a better understanding of the roles of neuroserpin in the inflammatory system will widen its use in the treatment of adult stroke as well as neonatal hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy . additionally , neuroserpin is a tpa - independent mediator of neurite - like outgrowth , cell - cell adhesion , and n - cadherin and nf-b expression .
neuroserpin is an important protein in the cns . through its interaction with its main substrate , tpa , to maintain a proteolytic balance , neuroserpin plays essential roles in both physiological and pathological processes .
the co - expression and preferential interaction with tpa indicates that neuroserpin is a selective inhibitor of tpa in the cns .
the spatial and temporal analysis of neuroserpin and tpa expression suggests a role for neuroserpin in maintaining the proteolytic balance in the cns , which is crucial for axonogenesis , synaptic connection , and synaptic plasticity .
