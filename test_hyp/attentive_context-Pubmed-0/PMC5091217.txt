, it was necessary to perform a meta - analysis to determine the association of cav1 rs3807989 polymorphism with the risk of af in the present study .
we found a significant association of cav1 gene rs3807989 polymorphism with af risk under 5 comparisons : allelic , homozygous , heterozygous , dominant , and recessive genetic models .
our results revealed a significant association between cav1 gene rs3807989 polymorphism and susceptibility to af , suggesting that the presence of allelic g might be one of the genetic factors conferring susceptibility to af . to confirm this association ,
these findings suggested that individuals with g allele of cav1 gene rs3807989 polymorphism may experience a higher risk of af .
as shown in figure 2 , all 5 comparisons revealed the association between cav1 rs3807989 polymorphism and af risk after meta - analysis with fixed- or random - effects models : allelic model ( g / a ; or=1.228 , 95%ci : 1.0611.420 ; p=0.006 ) , homozygote model ( gg / aa ; or=1.439 , 95%ci : 1.0941.894 ; p=0.009 ) , heterozygote model ( gg / ga ; or=1.257 , 95%ci : 1.0641.486 ; p=0.007 ) , dominant model ( gg / aa+ga ; or=1.287 , 95%ci : 1.0761.540 ; p=0.006 ) , and recessive model ( aa / ga+gg ; or=0.738 , 95%ci : 0.6290.867 ; p<0.001 ) .
