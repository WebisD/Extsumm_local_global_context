we describe an uncommon late biliary complication that occurred after slt and was successfully treated by a multidisciplinary approach .  
split - liver   transplantation ( slt ) is an   attractive alternative procedure to expand the donor pool in patients waiting for liver transplantation .
the use of nbca in obliteration of a dilated bile duct seems to be a safe procedure with good results providing a less invasive option than hepatic resection above all in high - risk patients with posttransplant bile duct injuries , decreasing the morbidity associated with chronic external biliary drainage .
biliary complications continue to be the major cause of morbidity after slt with a reported high incidence ranging between 10% and 32%   . as a consequence of bile duct anatomic variations
described the use of a cyanoacrlylate in the treatment of a pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy .
chemical bile duct embolization treatment could represent a valuable   solution to treat uncommon biliary complications .
the percutaneous interventional technique represents an effective valuable approach to reduce mortality and morbidity in the treatment of biliary complications after liver transplantation .
the standard split - liver procedure for a child and an adult ( adult / pediatric split liver ttransplantation , a / p slt ) , by splitting segment ii - iii for pediatric recipient and segment i - iv - v - vi - vii - viii for an adult , is an accepted surgical option with good results both for the adult and for pediatric recipient .
