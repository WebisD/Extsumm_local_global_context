all of the individuals with a cdr  =  1 had a primary clinical diagnosis of dementia of the alzheimer 's type at baseline .
we examine the relationships between a deposition , white matter damage , and dementia in a population of cognitively normal , very mildly demented , and mildly demented individuals .
white matter damage in the brain can be assessed using visual ratings of wmh , quantification of wmh volumes , and using diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) .

the work presented here demonstrated the detrimental influences of advancing age , amyloid deposition in the brain , and white matter damage .
these factors independently discriminated healthy controls from very mildly and mildly demented individuals . from a clinical standpoint , this suggests that easily available radiological measures of white matter health could be an asset in disease diagnosis in addition to psychometric testing and ad biomarkers such as amyloid imaging .

of the 51 individuals with a cdr rating of 0.5 , 21 had a dat diagnosis at baseline and 14 received a diagnosis at a later clinical point .
