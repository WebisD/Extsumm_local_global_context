clinical and histologic investigations were used to evaluate the preformed titanium mesh 's efficacy as a barrier membrane against a mixture of autologous and fdba in localized alveolar bone regeneration .
preformed titanium mesh supports the grafted space for new bone formation , makes application and removal convenient , and minimizes the risk of mesh exposure in the reconstruction of peri - implant alveolar bone defects .
the customized , three - dimensional , and preformed titanium mesh used in combination with autologous bone and fdba induced successful bone regeneration in peri - implant defects occurring after implant placement . even in the cases of titanium mesh exposure ,
we used a customized , three - dimensional , preformed titaniumn mesh ( smartbuilder ; osstem , busan , korea ) to reconstruct the peri - implant defects occurring immediately after implant placement .
postsurgical complications were observed in three of the 10 patients ( 30% ) . in two of these patients ,
radiologic evaluation at mesh insertion , removal and 12 months after definitive prostheses were placed showed stable marginal bone in all implants.(fig .
the quality and quantity of the regenerated bone was clinically acceptable ; however , at the exposed site , there was some resorption of graft materials .
