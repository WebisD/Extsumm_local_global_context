recollapse of augmented vertebrae may induce severe kyphotic deformity.22 ) the purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for gradual vertebral body height decrease in augmented vertebrae after vertebroplasty .
more than 4 cc of injected cement and air cleft within the fractured vertebrae on admission induced gradual height decrease of augmented vertebrae . thus , longer
from january 2012 to december 2013 , we performed 186 level vertebroplasties for compression fractures in 160 patients .
follow - up is needed in such cases , even when patients do not complain of the reappearance of severe back pain .
percutaneous vertebroplasty is a procedure used to treat a painful compression fracture in the absence of a neurologic deficit .
percutaneous vertebroplasty is a relatively safe and effective treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures.2 ) after vertebroplasty , progressive decrease of augmented vertebral body height is noted .
we selected 44 patients , with a first occurrence of a single vertebral compression fracture at the thoracolumbar junction ( from t11 to l2 ) .
vertebral body height often increases during vertebroplasty , although the clinical significance of restoring height is unknown.7 ) kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty showed similar reduction in pain and disability , with similar safety and complication rates.4 ) vertebroplasty was not associated with increased refracture rates in different vertebrae.2123 ) however , other report showed refracture of different vertebrae in the vertebroplasty group occurred much sooner than that in a conservative treatment group.21 ) recollapse of augmented vertebrae is not relatively common . in our study ,
