doing so , we wished 
 to complement existing studies targeted at evaluation of chemokine 
 inflammatory response in pathogenesis of these two 
 atherosclerosis - associated complications .
emphasis should be given to patients ' stratification in order to 
 ascertain clinical utilisation of mcp-1 measurements , namely in 
 ischemic stroke .
the 
 differences between both investigated patient groups and controls , 
 therefore , reached high significance ( is versus   c , p < .001 ; mi 
 versus   c , p < .002 ) , while there was no difference between 
 patients ' groups themselves ( is versus   mi , p > .05 ) .
recently , it has 
 been shown that the levels of several cytokines are elevated in 
 the blood of patients with is and mi  
this increase was more apparent 
 in the is group ( 384    pg / ml ) , for which also a greater degree 
 of interindividual variability was observed than among patients 
 with mi ( 360    pg / ml ) . while only 10/40 ( 25% ) of control 
 subjects had mcp-1 level higher than 314 pg / ml ( 75th percentile of 
 the control group ) , in patients with is this proportion reached 
 68% ( 27 /40 ) and in mi group it was 61% ( 39/64 ) .
