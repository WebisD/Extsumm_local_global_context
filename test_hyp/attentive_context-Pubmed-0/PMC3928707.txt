chikungunya fever is a global health problem and several outbreaks have occurred in the last 50 years in asia and africa .
, we report on the advancements made towards the development of anti - inflammatory agents , antivirals and vaccines for the efficient control of chikv infections .

recent outbreaks in la runion and italy have raised the awareness of the need to develop effective antiviral drugs or vaccines against chikv .
owing to the recent outbreaks of chikv in asia , africa and la runion island there has been a renewed interest in the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to manage chikv infections . in this article
intensive studies are needed to evaluate the effect of appropriate compounds in animal models and humans .
although many antiviral compounds have been shown to be effective in cell culture , very few compounds have been evaluated in animal models .
however , this is not cost - effective and it is critical to develop antiviral drugs and/or vaccines for the control of chikv infections .
