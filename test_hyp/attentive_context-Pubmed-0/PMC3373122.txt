alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common form of dementia with a progressive course .
ad pathology evidences neuronal damage in specific vulnerable brain regions and circuits involved in memory and language , namely , the hippocampus and cerebral cortex , which appears to be preceded by synaptic and neuronal dysfunction . from a pathology perspective , the presence of extracellular plaques , mainly composed of amyloid beta peptide ( a ) , a 39- to 42-aminoacid residue peptide , derived from the processing of amyloid precursor protein ( app ) , and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles , consisting of tau protein aggregates , constitute , important hallmarks of the disease and serve , as a dividing line between ad and other dementias   .
one hypothesis that may account for the heterogeneous nature of ad and the fact that aging is the most obvious risk factor is the increased generation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) ; indeed , neurons are extremely sensitive to attack by destructive free radicals .
it has been hypothesized that multiple factors , including genetic components , oxidative stress , intracellular and/or extracellular accumulation of a , excitotoxicity , inflammation , mitochondrial dysfunction , alteration of cytoskeleton and synapse components and neuronal loss , may play important roles in the onset of the disease .
