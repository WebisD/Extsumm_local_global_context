, we conducted a systematic review on currently available molecular diagnostics for bbsi with the main aim of presenting their clinical significance in healthcare settings .
google scholar has been of our interest because it covers a broad range of scientific papers in different research areas ; the same is for pubmed which covers around 26 million of biomedical papers from medline and life science journals .
the online paper search was conducted on two different dates ( february 12 and 27 , 2016 ) .
in conclusion , it is noteworthy that molecular techniques are now emerging as another promising option for diagnosis of bbsi . in this review , pcr - based assays
published papers related to our review topic were carefully searched through google scholar and pubmed searching tools .
we are all convinced that elaboration of a quick and affordable tool for detecting bacterial pathogens in patients ' blood sample is of great interest in global public health .
poor healthcare settings , as bc runs slowly , this can sometimes oblige the physicians to prescribe nonspecific antibiotic treatment to patients necessitating initial use of empirical therapy   . therefore , a quick detection of bacterial infection is one of the most crucial and foreseen functions of most of laboratory bacteriology units . therefore , the discovery and application of rapid and reliable diagnostics for bbsi would represent a major unattainable need in curing seriously ill patients . in this regard
