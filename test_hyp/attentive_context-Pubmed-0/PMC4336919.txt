this paper aims to appraise this evidence , and discuss it in the context of potential future applications of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in the clinical management of psychoses .
why have we not been able to use neuroimaging in the clinical management of psychoses ?
still , the time may now have come when quick and noninvasive structural neuroimaging abandons the academic solitude in which it has been operating , and brings its novel methods and findings into the clinical arena .
after 30 years of using this approach , we have established that structural brain alterations are present in individuals with psychoses . while this information has advanced academic knowledge on the pathophysiology of these disorders , it has had limited utility in clinical practice .
it will then discuss studies that have examined the relationship between brain alterations and various medium- to long - term clinical and functional outcomes . in the third section
, it will discuss more recent evidence on the relationship between brain alterations and early outcomes , with a particular focus on the relationship between symptomatic responses and initial treatment with antipsychotic drugs .
finally , it will discuss the implications of having strong and valid neuroimaging markers of psychosis outcomes in developing targeted , as well as novel , treatment interventions for these disorders .
