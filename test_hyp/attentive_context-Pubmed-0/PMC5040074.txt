this case report describes the finding of a. ceylanicum in an australian soldier who developed symptomatic disease after returning from a deployment in solomon islands with ramsi .
the key points from this case report are : a. ceylanicum should be considered as a cause of acute eosinophilic enteritis in returned travellers , workers , or defense force personnel who have lived or visited tropical and subtropical countries ; laboratory confirmation may require persistence to make the diagnosis of hookworms and will require special tests ( morphology of adults after treatment ; molecular taxonomy on stools or infective larvae ) to identify the species ; and human infection with a. ceylanicum is probably endemic in the solomon islands and further study of the prevalence of different hookworm species present in this country is warranted .
the patient was a 26-year - old male living in townsville , north queensland , australia who presented in march 2004 with central poorly defined abdominal pain of 4 weeks duration and increased frequency of defecation .
a fourth hookworm also reported from humans , ancylostoma caninum represents a canine species with zoonotic potential .
human hookworm is common in the solomon islands , with an estimated 192,000 people ( 36% of the population ) infected , but the different species involved are yet to be determined [ 9 - 11 ] .
