the primary objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with pkc modulators or activators , particularly the phorbol ester prostratin , might elicit a severe cytotoxic profile or induce development effects in tissue systems within a tractable vertebrate model .
one purpose of this study was to rapidly assess the gross effects of pkc activation or modulation on zebrafish embryos and larvae , particularly morbidity or lethality , as major indicators of whether nontumor promoting phorbols , including prostratin , or the lactone bryostatin-1 , could be regarded as serious candidates for use in humans at reasonable and effective doses .
  . these studies also demonstrate that the nontumor promoting phorbol ester prostratin had no obvious deleterious effects on zebrafish development at concentrations below 10  m , which is sufficient to upregulate latent hiv-1 expression in human cellular systems   .
zebrafish embryos and larvae were particularly useful to study the effects of pkc activators or modulators in a whole animal model , since the compounds can be absorbed directly from the media and have clear effects on this organism 's development and survival .  
specificity was further noted by modest upregulation in the expression of the signaling factor , mapk-8 , within phorbol treated larvae .
