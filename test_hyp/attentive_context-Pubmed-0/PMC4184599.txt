we report a case of a patient visiting africa for the first time presenting with malaria and arf .
the foregoing report conclusively outlines the importance of rapid recognition , proper case assessment , and early initiation of repeated sessions of hemodialysis in addition to fluid replacement and appropriate antimalarial therapy for early recovery of renal function in marf .
p. malariae has been associated with chronic progressive renal failure , while p. falciparum is usually associated with arf as in our patient .
, marf manifests clinically and pathologically as acute tubular necrosis as is reported in this case .
marf is almost always caused by p.falciparum infection although renal involvement has also been reported in p. malariae , and recently in p. vivax infections .
we are reporting a case of a 55-year - old male caucasian referred from morogoro regional referral hospital to the university of dodoma haemodialysis unit , with a 3-days history of acute onset of high - grade fever associated with episodes of nonprojectile vomiting with the vomitus being mostly comprised of recently eaten food .
it is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus plasmodium , namely , p. falciparum , p. vivax , p. malariae , and p. ovale , while p. knowles commonly affects nonhuman primates .
