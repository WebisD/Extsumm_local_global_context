therefore , the present study was conducted to examine the effects of 
 exercise on the recovery of spinal cord nerve cells damaged due to pain signals , which are a 
 major symptom of osteoarthritis .
injected rats were randomly divided into 4 
 groups : sham control group without mia injection ( sg ) , control group with injected mia ( cg ) , 
 oa without exercise ( neg ) , oa with exercise ( eg ) .
in this study , a results of measuring the expression of gap-43 , gap-43 was observed in all 
 groups , showed that the significant difference in each group ( table 1table 1.the comparison of expression of ngf in spinal cord between four groups unit ;

 sd : mean  standard deviation . significant difference from sg .
when the above - mentioned results were viewed comprehensively , it could be seen that 
 exercise increased the gap-43 expression in the spinal cord to promote the regeneration of 
 spinal cord nerve cells damaged due to chronic osteoarthritis .
