myocardial bridging is defined as an epicardial coronary artery that goes intramurally through the myocardium beneath the muscle bridge . while generally benign , myocardial bridges can cause ischemia , ventricular tachyarrhythmias , atrioventricular block , and sudden cardiac death.1)2 ) for symptomatic patients , various therapeutic approaches have been attempted , but the optimal treatment of myocardial bridging still remains controversial.3)4 ) coronary stenting has been another therapeutic option with medical and surgical treatment , but the high risk of perforation and high rate of in - stent restenosis have limited its use.5 - 10 ) recently , we experienced a patient with a perforated coronary artery after implantation of a drug - eluting stent ( des ) that was successfully rescued by deployment of covered stent in symptomatic myocardial bridging .
a 46 year - old woman who had no coronary risk factors , presented with exertional chest pain for several weeks .
we performed coronary angiography which showed significant stenosis ( up to 80% ) aggravated by severe myocardial bridging at the mid - portion of the left anterior descending ( lad ) artery ( fig .
although coronary stenting is an effective interventional approach to improve symptoms in selected patients with myocardial bridging , it is associated with a high risk of coronary perforation.5 - 7 ) the reason for this phenomenon is not clear .
