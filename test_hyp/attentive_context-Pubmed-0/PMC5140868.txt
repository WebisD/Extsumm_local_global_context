we herein report the successful bronchoscopic resection of a symptomatic localized polyp due to to using a high - frequency snare .
an 80-year - old japanese man was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation and management of multiple tracheobronchial polyposis and right middle lobe atelectasis . he had a history of polyarteritis nodosa and had been treated with corticosteroids ( prednisolone 6 mg / day ) .
tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica ( to ) is a rare benign airway disease typically characterized by the presence of multiple rock - garden - like nodules in the lower trachea and upper main bronchi ( 1 ) .
physicians should therefore be aware of this disease and its clinical symptoms and include it in the differential diagnosis .
several reported cases have demonstrated successful surgical intervention and bronchoscopic laser therapy for advanced symptomatic patients ( 2,3 ) .
no guidelines have yet been established for the management of to , and systemic or inhaled corticosteroid treatment might be one of treatment choices for to without any problematic clinical symptoms , as seen in the present patient . in conclusion , we herein reported a rare case of to accompanied by unusual bronchoscopic features , such as multiple tracheobronchial polyposis , which was successfully treated using a high - frequency snare .
