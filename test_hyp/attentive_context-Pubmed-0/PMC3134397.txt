the human cmv ( hcmv ) as well as its murine relative ( mcmv )   and other species such as the guinea pig ( gpcmv )     , rhesus ( rhcmv )       , and chimpanzee ( ccmv )         have been the subject of recent studies designed to understand not only the basic genetics , biochemistry , and biology of these complex organisms but also to discern the immune responses of their hosts , with an ultimate goal of developing effective vaccines to alleviate pathogenic effects of the viruses .
these viruses exhibit similarities in the life cycle of acute infection , persistence and latent infection or superinfection , and reactivation under conditions of immune suppression      . the subject of this review is a structural , genetic , and functional analysis of a set of genes and their encoded glycoproteins that have been adapted by mcmv to assure the continued survival of the virus .
because of the structural similarities of these encoded proteins to mhc - i and other mhc - i - like molecules of the host ,   we argue that these molecules were derived from lateral ( horizontal ) genetic transmission from host to virus .
a rate of 14% is also a major concern , leading to long - term sequelae such as neurodevelopmental disabilities , including mental retardation and sensorineural hearing loss .
