when measuring the expression levels of inflammatory molecules , the rbcgs - vaccinated mice also displayed reduced levels of expression which were in accordance with the remissive granulomatous inflammation ( figures 5 and 6 ) .
consistent with the protective efficacy , the inflammation responses in the infected lungs alleviated greatly in rbcgs - vaccinated mice after infection ( figure 5 ) .
however , the two rbcg strains between themselves , which expressed the chimeric antigen ag856a2 at different levels , induced different antigen - specific ifn- production and comparable number of m. tb - specific cd4 t cells expressing il-2 . and the protective efficacies imposed by the two rbcg strains displayed no significant differences although higher protection was observed in rbcg486 vaccinated mice than that in rbcg186 vaccinated mice .
they vaccinated mice with different doses of fusion protein ag85b - tb10.4 which were emulsified in adjuvant ic31 , and the higher immune response and protective efficacy were only observed when the antigen was administered in proper doses , and decreasing or increasing of the antigen dose would dramatically dwarf the protection efficacies of the antigens . in our study ,
we used flow cytometry to measure the capacity of m. tb - specific cd4 t cells from spleens of vaccinated mice producing cytokines ifn- , tnf- , and il-2 at single cell level after stimulation in vitro with ppd .
