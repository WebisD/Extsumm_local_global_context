we recently reported that platelets are an important component of the host innate immune response against malaria infection .
the protective power of the platelet in malaria infection is only beginning to be appreciated . while convincing evidence of their importance in clinical infection is still needed , advances in understanding the molecular detail of parasite killing process have led to some very interesting findings .
malaria remains one of world s major infectious diseases and an impediment to economic development .
the findings may also help to explain why p. falciparum is a particular problem in africa .
it also allows time for the subsequent development of an adaptive response , which is capable of clearing the infection and protecting against clinically symptomatic malaria .
useful novel antimalarial molecules based on the pf4 platelet effector molecule are an exciting prospect .
novel approaches to treatment and a greater understanding of disease pathogenesis and the host response to infection are desperately needed .
it is also antigen - specific , and several years and many exposures are needed to build an effective immunity against the multitudinous array of parasite antigens in any given endemic region .
innate immune mechanisms are therefore crucial in all malarial infections to buffer against the early growth of blood - stage parasites .
