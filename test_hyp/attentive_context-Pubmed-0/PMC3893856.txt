bnr is a rare phenomenon ( 12 cases of bnr in a 10-year period ) and can be a severe form of rejection in that there is cardiac dysfunction .
since the outcome of patients with bnr ( which includes cardiac dysfunction ) has not been well established , we sought to review the characteristics and treatment response of patients who have developed bnr after heart transplantation .
although the prevalence of the so - called biopsy - negative rejection has declined with the clinical diagnosis of amr , there are incidences of patients who present with cardiac dysfunction ( left ventricular ejection fraction , lvef  45% ) but have no biopsy findings of cellular or antibody - mediated rejection .
the mean time to the first incidence of bnr is 7.8  7.5 months and no patient had treated rejection before onset of bnr except for the patient at the second onset . among the 106 biopsies that have been done before bnr , 24 ( 23% ) demonstrated low grade acute cellular rejection ( 1r , 1a , or 1b ) and 1 ( 0.9% ) showed suspicious antibody - mediated rejection ( amr 1 ) . de novo circulating antibodies developed in 3 cases ( in 3 patients ) and 1 of them had donor - specific antibodies . 4 out of the 12 cases presented with lvef  35% and presented with heart failure symptoms . of these 4 heart failure cases ,
