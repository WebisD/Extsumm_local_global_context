therefore , we conducted the present meta - analysis to explore the relation between the level of dcr3 , clinicopathological characteristics , and survival of female reproductive cancer patients .
our meta - analysis indicates a positive association between the overexpression of dcr3 and carcinogenesis , deterioration , and progression of female reproductive cancers . in conclusion ,
furthermore , subgroup analysis showed a consistent trend ; for example , cervical cancer ( or=7.97 , 95% ci : 4.7013.49 ) , ovarian cancer ( or=14.03 , 95% ci : 3.1662.01 ) , and breast cancer ( or=19.35 , 95% ci : 4.4684.03 ) . in analysis of female reproductive cancer patients
regardless of subtype , 3 clinicopathological parameters were found to be significantly associated with overexpression of dcr3 as compared to controls : advanced tnm stage ( or=5.51 , 95% ci : 2.8310.71 ) , poor grade of differentiation ( or=4.16 , 95% ci : 2.287.60 ) , and lymph node metastasis ( or=5.89 , 95% ci : 3.1610.96 ) . in the sub - analysis , a stronger association was found between tnm stage and patients with overexpression of dcr3 in ovarian cancer ( or=6.80 , 95% ci : 2.5018.50 ) than in cervical cancer ( or=4.76 , 95% ci : 1.7413.01 ) or breast cancer ( or=3.73 , 95% ci : 0.7319.09 , figure 3 ) . as shown in figure 4 , for each type of cancer , a concordant relationship
