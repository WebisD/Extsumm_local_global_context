the aim was to detect and investigate if the effects of il-10 on prohibitin has antifibrotic effects and prevents the progression of intestinal fibrosis in the il-10ko mice model of cd and to determine the role of prohibitin in intestinal fibrosis of murine colitis .
the animals were randomly allocated into three groups : group a ( control group , 18 wt mice ) , group b ( il-10ko mice group , 18 il-10ko mice ) , and group c ( il-10 treatment group , 12 il-10ko mice ) .
therefore , we demonstrated that regulation of prohibitin plays an important role in preventing and ameliorating intestinal fibrosis related to intestinal inflammation . in conclusion , lowered expression of prohibitin is associated with intestinal fibrosis progression , and il-10 treatment is associated with increased prohibitin in il-10ko mice .
, we found that il-10 treatment in mice was associated with increased expression of prohibitin and nrf2 , attenuation of the lesion in the intestinal fibrosis , and significant reduction in the expressions of tgf-l ,  -sma , and collagen .
were treated with intraperitoneal injections of il-10 ( 5  g / kg body weight , three times per week ) and 0.9% physiological saline since week 12 .
