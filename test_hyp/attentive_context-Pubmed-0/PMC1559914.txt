prevention and reversal of abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau as 
 a potential promising therapeutic strategy is also discussed .
therefore , for developing rational therapeutic 
 treatment of ad , it is essential to understand the molecular 
 mechanism by which tau abnormalities lead to neurofibrillary 
 degeneration . because tau aggregated in the brain of ad and all other 
 tauopathies
because abnormally 
 hyperphosphorylated tau is pivotal to ad and has been extensively 
 studied , this review focuses on tau hyperphosphorylation . 

is always abnormally hyperphosphorylated , numerous 
 studies have focused on the roles of the abnormal 
 hyperphosphorylation and the mechanism leading to tau 
 hyperphosphorylation .
several other brain proteins such as 
 neurofilaments , microtubule - associated protein ( map ) 1  b , 
 -tubulin , and -catenin are also found to be 
 hyperphosphorylated   , suggesting that the 
 protein phosphorylation / dephosphorylation system might be 
 dysregulated in ad brain .
abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau and its deposits in 
 the brain is also seen in several other neurodegenerative diseases 
 that are collectively named tauopathies ( for review , see 
   ) .
although alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) and its main brain histopathology , that is , senile plaques and 
 neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) , were described a century ago , 
 significant research advances in the disease began only a few 
 decades ago .
