in the present study investigating the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ngf and development of oa pain , higher expression of the genes encoding tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , and ngf was observed in the st of an oa str / ort mouse model compared to that in c57bl/6j mice .
notably , the treatment of cultured synovial cells with tnf- and il-1 stimulated ngf expression and tnf- also stimulated ngf expression in cd11b - positive and cd11b - negative cell fractions .
in addition , the regulation of ngf expression by inflammatory cytokines in synovial macrophages and fibroblasts was also examined .
finally , present study did not confirm that the protein levels of these cytokines correlated with the expression levels . in conclusion , the present results support the hypothesis that tnf- regulates ngf expression in synovial fibroblasts and macrophages and il-1 regulates ngf expression in synovial fibroblasts in oa mice .
in addition , ngf expression was specifically detected in the cd11b - positive and cd11b - negative cell fractions isolated from st , whereas higher tnf- , il-1 , and il-6 gene expression was observed in the cd11b - positive cell fractions .
, we characterized the expression profiles of several inflammatory cytokines and ngf in the st of str / ort mice .
