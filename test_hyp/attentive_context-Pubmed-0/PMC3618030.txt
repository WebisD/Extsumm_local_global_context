, we report a case of a hemorrhagic cmv colitis that occurred in an immunocompromised patient after a colectomy due to colon cancer and was successfully treated with ganciclovir .
, the number of high - risk patients who undergo surgery is increasing ; therefore , the reactivation of latent cmv infection in immunocompromised patients should be actively considered for the differential diagnosis , leading to timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment .
cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) colitis is common among immunocompromised patients who are more prone to opportunistic infections .
after the infection of cmv is detected by histology or serology , antiviral treatment is usually chosen initially . since cmv disease
can not be diagnosed on clinical symptoms alone , diagnosis and treatment are sometimes delayed . here
after improvement of the colitis - related symptoms , the patient was discharged from our hospital .
an 85-year - old woman underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for investigation of anemia . a laterally spreading tumor of the granular type , 85 mm in diameter ,
the case we mentioned above can potentially occur in immunocompromised patients . with recent progress in medicine
the patient underwent ileocecal resection followed by stapled functional end - to - end anastomosis ( fig .
