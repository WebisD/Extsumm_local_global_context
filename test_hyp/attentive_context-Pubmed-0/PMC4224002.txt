cutaneous amyloidosis were classified into primary cutaneous amyloidosis ( pca ) , secondary cutaneous amyloidosis , and systemic cutaneous amyloidosis .
we report a case with peculiar mottled pigmentation originally referred for vitiligo , but later proved as acd by histopathological examination .
the disorder was thought to be familial as his siblings were affected with the similar condition .
a 12-year - old boy presented with asymptomatic , generalized mottled hypo- and hyper - pigmented lesions of 6-year duration .
therefore , it is possible that several cases of this elusive disorders exist , but are often misdiagnosed . on the other hand , the treatment of acd still remains a challenge .
etiological factors associated with pca is still unknown , but its striking familial occurence suggests the role of genetic .
pca is a rare , chronic progressive skin disease , defined as deposition of amyloid in previously apparent normal skin without systemic involvement .
based on clinical presentation and the histopathology examination , we made the diagnosis of primary cutaneous amyloidosis , presented as amyloid cutis dyschromica .
the diagnosis of acd in our patient was not readily recognized as it mimicked , to some degree , other relatively common disorders with pigmentation feature .
