mp combined with emg 
 es  over a 6-week period of daily training in patients showing right brain damage with 
 un .
this study showed that mp - emg es is an effective method for reducing unilateral neglect in 
 stroke patients .
however , several factors need to be considered when applying this method . 
 because mp - emg es requires the patient to be capable of imaging movement of the body on the 
 neglect side
the 
 experimental group ( n=16 ) received mp - emg es in addition to conventional rehabilitation 
 therapy ( crt : physical therapy and occupational therapy ) , whereas the control group ( n=17 ) 
 received cyclic es in addition to the same crt .
the inclusion criteria for participation were : ( 1 ) onset duration of 
 > 6 months , ( 2 ) right hemisphere stroke with un , ( 3 ) mini - mental status 
 examination score > 24 , ( 4 ) ability to imagine ( average score on the 
 vividness of movement imagery questionnaire < 3 ) , and ( 5 ) active wrist muscle strength 
 > 2 on the medical research council ( mrc ) scale .
mp - emg es seems to remedy 
 the deficiencies of mental practice alone . in this study , patients were instructed to imagine a large and powerful movement of the 
 neglected u / e during the mental practice stage of mp - emg es treatment . when imagining the 
 movement of the neglected u / e , the muscles in the u / e show dynamic regulation and 
 changes5 .
