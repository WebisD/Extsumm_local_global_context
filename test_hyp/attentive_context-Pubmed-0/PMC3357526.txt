we set out to measure intra - abdominal and subcutaneous fat ultrasonographically in healthy 5-year - old children , to study whether differences in growth in the first 3 postnatal months , in particular increased weight gain accounting for length gain , are associated with increased central adiposity in early childhood .
after multiple imputation of birth length , to have complete data on size at birth for all 360 children in which an ultrasound was successfully performed and growth data was available , the associations between postnatal wlg and bmi , waist circumference , and subcutaneous fat strengthened . regarding intra - abdominal fat , a trend towards significance was observed : per 1 unit increase in z - score wlg , intra - abdominal fat was 0.51  mm higher ( 95%-ci : 0.14 , 1.2 , p value : 0.12 ) .
relative to length gain is associated with increased general and central adiposity , characterized by higher bmi , larger waist circumference , more abdominal subcutaneous fat , and likely more intra - abdominal fat at 5 years of age .
median bmi , waist circumference , subcutaneous fat , and mean intra - abdominal fat were 15.1  kg / m ( interquartile range ( iqr ) : 14.316.1 ) , 52.5  mm ( iqr : 50.554.8 ) , 6.3  mm ( iqr : 5.07.9 ) , and 36.4  6.5  mm , respectively .
