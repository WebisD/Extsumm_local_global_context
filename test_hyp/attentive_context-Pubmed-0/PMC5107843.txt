since trx have been reported to act as chemoattractant for leukocytes and to induce cytokines   we wanted to examine if srtrx - lp has similar impact on monocytic cells . in the present study we cloned and characterized two trx - lps and investigated some functional activities including their chemotactic activity , their ability to promote wound healing processes in the intestinal epithelial cell ( iec ) caco-2 model , and their involvement in cytokine release in a three - dimensional- ( 3d- ) cell culture model
in summary , we identified and characterized the secreted trx - lps from s. ratti and t. suis .
in particular , the promoting wound healing effect indicates the involvement of trx - lp in many pathways that are initiated in the local parasite - host interaction
both multifunctional proteins expressed antioxidative activity and the capability to interact with the host 's mucosal cells , indicated by chemotactic activity for monocytic cells , binding to host 's epithelial cells as well as to immune cells , by the release of cytokines .
the molecular mass ( 3033  kda ) as well as the proteins structure suggested similar functions to those of the human trx - related protein ( trp32 ) , also known as txnl-1 , which protects the cell against glucose deprivation - induced cytotoxicity and is involved in antiapoptotic signaling   .
