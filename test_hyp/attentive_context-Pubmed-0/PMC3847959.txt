our findings indicate that the disease typically occurs in the fourth decade of life and has a statistically significant association with pregnancy / parity , lactation , breastfeeding patterns , menopausal status , employment status , history of use of contraception , having mice in one 's household , and not wearing a bra .
cases were more likely to experience their breast problem in the left breast ( 55% ) than the right breast ( 34% ) ; however , this information was reported for too few of the cases for the finding to be significant .
use of only one breast as a risk factor appeared to have a significant interaction with whether or not the breast problem was associated with lactation ( or = 0.32 , 0.220.46 ) .
previous studies have suggested risk factors for cm involving parity , breastfeeding habits , contraception use , socioeconomic status , and treatment patterns ; however , ours is the first study to present statistically significant findings   .
we preformed a retrospective hospital - based case - control study and identified 85 cases of cm and 112 controls from 5 hospitals in morocco and egypt .
the majority of the cases were granulomatous mastitis ( n = 37 , 43.5% ) , one of the types of chronic mastitis included . in terms of temporal proximity to lactation ( defined as problem within 6 months of lactation ) , no significant differences were seen between cases and controls ; however , information was missing for the majority of both cases and controls .
