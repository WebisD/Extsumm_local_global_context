inbred balb / c , cba / ca , and c57bl/6 strains of mice ( with different mhc - i haplotypes ) were compared for their capacity to cope with a n. caninum infection .
in this study , we compared the capacities of three inbred mouse strains expressing different mhc - i molecules to cope with a n. caninum infection .
the results demonstrate that a meaningful evaluation of the efficacy of , for example , vaccine candidates and/or chemotherapeutically interesting compounds against experimental infection with n. caninum in mice requires standardization with regard to the mouse strains used for such experiments .
thus , there is clearly a need for a standardisation of experimental murine infection models for n. caninum in order to achieve comparable results between research groups that work with different tools for immunoprevention and chemotherapy .
in contrast , the use of balb / c mice , although extensively employed , is debatable due to their inherent th2 bias , resulting in increased susceptibility to n. caninum .
the present study showed high variations in morbidity and mortality in the three inbred mouse strains balb / c , cba / ca , and c57bl/6 after inoculation with different numbers of n. caninum ( nc - liv ) tachyzoites , demonstrating that the choice of mouse strain plays a crucial role for the assessment of experimental infections and agents that could potentially interfere therein .   while balb / c mice did not suffer from clinical signs of neosporosis after a challenge dose of 1  10  n. caninum tachyzoites , infection with 5  10 tachyzoites resulted in severe clinical symptoms starting at day 20 pi .
