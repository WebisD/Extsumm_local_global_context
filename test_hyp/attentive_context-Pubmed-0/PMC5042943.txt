a cross - sectional retrospective study was carried out according to world health organization guidelines over 6  months and included 197 general practitioners ( gps ) and 19,700 prescriptions.this study revealed that the overall index of rational drug prescribing ( irdp ) indicator for gps was below the optimal prescribing practice level.we found disparities in the irdp between gps at different health facilities .
values for nhif facilities were farther from the prescribing indicator standards than were smoh and other health facilities , except for the percentage of prescriptions containing antibiotics ( nhif 45.91 vs. smoh 57.24 vs. others 56.84  % ) ( table  3).table  3prescribing indicators and health facility typestype of health facility owner or operatorsmohnhifotheroverallnumber of gps1264328197average number of drugs per prescription2.442.972.42.55medicines prescribed by generic name ( % ) 48.9638.4749.2846.34prescriptions containing antibiotics ( % ) 57.2445.9156.8454.71prescriptions containing injectable formulations ( % ) 12.5515.589.9712.84drugs prescribed from gp s medicines list ( % ) 82.9772.6589.2781.19average cost of prescription ( sdgs)36.0759.5431.6940.57irdp3.463.083.753.39
