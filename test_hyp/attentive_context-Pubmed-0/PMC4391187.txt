thus , the aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of semi - quantitative methods to assess rv function using tapse with a reference point within the ventricle ( tapsein ) or with one outside the ventricle ( tapseout ) and rv fractional shortening ( rvfs ) derived from cmr images in comparison to rv volumetry in patients with hcm .
furthermore , we performed a subgroup analysis in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( hocm ) , as well as in patients with hypertrophic non - obstructive cardiomyopathy ( hncm ) to test these measurement approaches .

 out tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion with a reference point outside the right ventricle in the subgroup analysis of patients with hocm ( n  =  40 ) , rvef showed a significant but weak correlation with tapseout ( r  =  0.36 , 95  % ci 0.140.62 , p  =  0.02 ) and no correlation with tapsein ( r  =  0.05 , 95  % ci 0.190.29 , p  =  0.7 ) and rvfs ( r  =  0.20 , 95  % ci 0.040.44 , p  =  0.2 ) . in patients with hncm ( n  =  65 ) , there was a moderate correlation between rvef and tapseout ( r  =  0.57 , 95  % ci 0.490.81 p  <  0.0001 ) but a weak correlation with tapsein ( r  =  0.39 , 95  % ci 0.250.57 , p  =  0.001 ) and rvfs ( r  =  0.38 , 95  % ci 0.240.56 , p  =  0.002 ) . in healthy controls
