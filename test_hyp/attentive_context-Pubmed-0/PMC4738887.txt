however , data comparisons against adiposity - based health risk percentiles were not preformed in that study . given the potential use of lbia in the school setting , the impact that a structured in - school physical education class has on lbia % bf measurements and the childs adiposity - based health risk classification is in need of clarification . therefore , the purposes of this investigation were to determine : 1 ) whether participation in a structured in - school physical education class altered the lbia - determined % bf value ; and 2 ) whether the potential exercise - induced % bf magnitude of change altered the health risk classification of the child .
however , in 19.7% the % bf value increased and 6.6% of the girls experienced no change pre- to post - exercise
as such , adhering to the pre - test exercise guideline appears unnecessary when using lbia to categorize the health - risk of an adolescent girl .
significant reductions ( p<0.0001 ) were observed for % bf , impedance , body mass and fat mass in the girls when compared to pre - exercise values ( table 1 ) .
(  95th percentile for body fat ) , following the exercise class : only 2 girls had changed classification categories : 1 from the  healthy - fat  to  underfat  category and 1 from the  obese  to  overfat  category . despite these two changes , when using the 85th percentile as the cutoff point to determine cardiovascular risk related to adiposity level ( > 85th percentile = unhealthy body fat ) , both girls remained in the same adiposity classification category ( healthy vs. unhealthy ) following exercise .
