in conclusion , considering the poor clinical outcome of the available systemic and topical treatments for nail psoriasis , hpch nail lacquer is a valid , effective , and safe option that can be used to decrease the signs of nail dystrophy in psoriatic patients .
the present placebo - controlled study was designed to confirm whether the strengthening and hardening properties of this product could improve the structure of the nail plates on psoriatic nails .
a product currently on the market , consisting of a hydro - soluble nail lacquer and containing hydroxypropyl - chitosan ( hpch ) , horsetail extract ( equisetum arvense ) , and methylsulfonylmethane , as its main ingredients , has shown its effectiveness in the management of nail splitting and nail brittleness.9 in a previous , preliminary study , we reported the effectiveness of this nail lacquer on signs of dystrophy in psoriatic nails,10 where the hpch nail lacquer was able to improve clinical signs such as pitting , leukonychia , and onycholysis ( ie , the most common manifestations of nail psoriasis ) .
the clinical cure rate , which was defined as the primary end point and evaluated every 4 weeks , showed that after 24 weeks ( end of treatment ) there was a statistically significant superiority of the hpch nail lacquer compared to placebo in both the itt ( fisher s exact test , p=0.0445 ) and pp populations ( fisher s exact test , p=0.0437 ) . to be precise , in the itt dataset , 55% ( 22/40 ) of patients treated with the hpch nail lacquer versus 31.7% ( 13/41 ) of the placebo patients were cured after 24 weeks ( figure 1 ) .
