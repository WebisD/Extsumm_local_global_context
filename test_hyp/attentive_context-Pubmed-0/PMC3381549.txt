our results show the potential role of ev68 infection in infants and children with rtis .
because 14 patients with ev68 were detected during 20062009 ( 8) , detection of 15 patients with ev68 during a 4-month period suggests an ev68 epidemic in the summer of 2010 in japan .
phylogenetic analysis with vp1 sequences showed that osaka strains differed genetically from previously reported strains . for precise analysis of osaka , fermon , and 3799 strains ,
alignment of partial 5 utr sequences showed that osaka and 3799 strains had deletions in 2 regions in contrast with the fermon strain , and the amplicon was shorter than expected .
results showed that osaka strains more closely resembled the 3799 strain than the fermon strain .
ev68 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid of a young adult patient with acute flaccid paralysis ( 5 ) .
during october 2009october 2010 , a total of 448 respiratory specimens were obtained from 448 patients ( 258 male patients and 190 female patients ) with rtis and fevers in a virus surveillance system in osaka , japan ( 9 ) . the mean  sd age of the patients was 41.4  53.7 months ( range < 1404 months ) , and 351 ( 78.3% ) were < 5 years of age .
