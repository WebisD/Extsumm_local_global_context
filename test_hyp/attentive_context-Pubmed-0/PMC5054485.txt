in our view , the properties of radicals and the reactions they enable 
 can have a profound impact in drug discovery , agrochemicals , material 
 science , and fine - chemical manufacturing .
progress in so many areas of societal need , from agrochemicals 
 to drugs , relies on advances in organic chemistry .
a perfect storm 
 of shortened timelines , increased regulatory hurdles , and shrinking 
 ip space has created an ideal opportunity for synthesis to make a 
 real difference .
in fact , the studies originating from our laboratory outlined in 
 this perspective were born out of necessity : simplifying the synthesis 
 of complex natural products in many cases required the invention of powerful radical - based reactions .
looking forward , one 
 can anticipate exciting new frontiers enabled by radical chemistry , 
 such as asymmetric cross - couplings of unstabilized systems , regiocontrolled 
 minisci - type functionalizations , and programmed cross - couplings 
 of olefin - derived radicals .
, they can save chemists enormous amounts of time 
 and can access wide areas of unexplored chemical space .
it is our hope that some of the transformations highlighted 
 will find use by those making materials for the betterment of humankind .
