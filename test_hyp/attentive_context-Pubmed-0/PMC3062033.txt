acl injury prevention programs addressing explicit rules regarding desired landing positions by emphasizing proper alignment of the hip , knee , and ankle are reported in the literature .
the purpose of this paper is to highlight the issue of motor learning in relation to acl injury prevention and to post suggestions for future research .
one problem could be the difficulties with the measurements of injury rates and the difficulties with the implementation of thorough large scale injury prevention programs .
the transition from conscious awareness during technique training sessions to unexpected and automatic movements during a training or game involves complicated motor control elements that might not fit in explicit learning strategies .
a second issue could be the transition from conscious awareness during training sessions on technique in the laboratory to unexpected and automatic movements during a training or game involves complicated motor control adaptations .
future acl intervention programs may need to provide individualized visual instructional review of jump - landing technique to allow individuals to view how they personally perform the movement task and actively problem solve ( by evaluating the mistakes and corrections of their trials ) to develop techniques , and find individual ways to achieve those techniques , to obtain proper jump - landing .
