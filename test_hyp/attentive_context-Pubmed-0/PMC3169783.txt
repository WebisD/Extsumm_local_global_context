our work demonstrates the usefulness of a computer vision - based system for identifying behavioral effects of novel compounds and mechanisms in a relatively high - throughput in vivo assay .
this approach is ideally suited to screening collections of existing drugs or drug candidates for previously unknown neuropharmacology , which could expedite the development of new and unexpected treatments for psychiatric disorders . in this paper , we demonstrate that this system can detect relevant cns activity of compounds representing mechanisms beyond those used clinically to treat psychiatric disorders .
this approach is ideally suited to screening libraries of existing drugs or drug candidates for previously unknown neuropharmacology , which could expedite the development of new and unexpected treatments for psychiatric disorders .
as one example , the pde10a inhibitor tp-10 demonstrated a behavioral signature in the pgi analytical system that was more similar to that of known antipsychotics than to that of other classes of neuropharmacological agents .
pgi analytical systems uses data from smartcube to compare the behavioral signature of a test compound to a database of behavioral signatures obtained using a large set of diverse reference compounds . in this way ,
our data demonstrate that the pgi analytics computer vision - based system rapidly detects relevant behavioral effects of compounds acting through new mechanisms .
