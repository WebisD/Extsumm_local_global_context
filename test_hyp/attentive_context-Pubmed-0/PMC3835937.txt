we focus on three specific molecular mechanisms that are potentially involved in the antidepressant action of ketamine : increased neuroplasticity and synaptogenesis via enhancement of glutamatergic signaling , changes in immune function and ( more preliminary ) regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( gsk-3 ) activity .
recent clinical research has provided evidence demonstrating that low - dose intravenous infusions of ketamine , a drug originally developed as an anaesthetic , can improve depressive symptoms within hours in subjects with treatment - resistant depression .
indeed , ketamine has been shown to induce psychosis in healthy subjects and to exacerbate psychotic symptoms in individuals affected by schizophrenia , and has also been abused as a  club drug ' . elucidating the molecular pathways via which ketamine
, there is a pressing need to identify novel antidepressant drugs that are fast acting and show better rates of response . despite the promising rapid antidepressant action
the growing understanding of the mode of action of ketamine has triggered an increased interest by pharmaceutical companies in the development of novel and more effective antidepressant drugs .
interestingly , glyx-13 is currently in a phase ii clinical development programme for treatment - resistant depression . given the evidence that ketamine is effective in cases of suicidal ideation , improved agents will clearly help to deal with this medical emergency .
