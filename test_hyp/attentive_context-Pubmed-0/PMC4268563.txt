, we review recent reports investigating the skin - whitening effect of ginseng and its components and the underlying mechanisms of action , and then discuss their potential as candidates for novel skin - whitening agents .
although issues surrounding the antimelanogenic activity of ginseng still remain controversial , especially in its effect on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and no , these recent findings suggest that ginseng and its constituents might be potential candidates for novel skin - whitening agents .
recently , several reports have shown that extract , powder , or some constituents of ginseng could inhibit melanogenesis in  vivo or in  vitro
, it has been proved that ginseng extracts actually show a wide range of effects against human diseases .
panax ginseng ( ginseng ) has been used traditionally in eastern asia over thousands of years .
. the underlying mechanisms of the antimelanogenic effect of ginseng or its components included the direct inhibition of key enzymes of melanogenesis ( tyrosinase and dct ) , inhibition of transcription factors ( mitf , nf-b ) or signaling pathways ( protein kinase a pathway and protein kinase c pathway ) involved in melanogenesis , decreasing the production of inducers of melanogenesis ( camp , gm - csf ) , and enhancing production of antimelanogenic factor ( il-13 ) . fig .
