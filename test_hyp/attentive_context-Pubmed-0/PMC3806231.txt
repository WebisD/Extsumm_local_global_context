we have summarized current knowledge on the pathogenesis of pvr and its correlation with ocular trauma and discussed how a fundamental understanding of the biochemical / molecular events involved is instrumental in developing novel treatment strategies .
those eyes that develop pvr after a trauma have worse visual outcomes , with pvr considered as the primary reason for the loss of vision . in this review ,
eye injury is a significant health problem worldwide that often results in disability ; the national research council reported eye injury as the most underrecognized major health problem affecting those living in industrialized countries .
the high incidence of pvr after ocular trauma is thought to be due to the inflammatory reaction that follows injury , which may have involved the direct introduction of cells from outside the eye .
such ocular trauma is the major cause of vision loss in young adults and children . up to 14%
is a frequent sequel of severe ocular trauma , and rd often leads to proliferative vitreoretinopathy ( pvr )   .
it is hoped that our treatment strategies will evolve and become even more effective in achieving complete vision recovery .
pvr is a complex cellular process characterized by the proliferation of membranes on or beneath the retina , intraretinal degeneration , gliosis , and contraction   . by a mechanism
