the present study was thus designed to investigate the association between polymorphisms of the vegf gene ( rs2010963 ) and the kdr gene ( rs2071559 ) and markers of carotid atherosclerosis ( such as carotid intima - media thickness ( cimt ) , the number of affected segments of carotid arteries , and the sum of plaques thickness ) in patients with t2 dm .
in contrast to the minor effect of the rs2071559 of kdr and the absence of the rs2010963 of the vegf , an association of either rs2071559 or rs2010963 with mi has recently been reported in caucasians with t2 dm   . our present findings and previous reports are additional evidence that markers of carotid atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic events ( i.e. , mi ) are most probably not regulated via similar genetical / biological mechanisms . to conclude , in our study we demonstrated a minor effect of the rs2071559 of kdr on markers of carotid atherosclerosis ( cimt , sum of plaque thickness ) in subjects with t2 dm , whereas we failed to demonstrate an effect of tested polymorphism of the vegf gene ( rs2010963 ) on markers of carotid atherosclerosis
the genotype distributions in both patients with t2 dm and controls were in hardy - weinberg equilibrium for both vegf gene polymorphisms [ rs2010963 : t2 dm ( genotype frequencies : cc genotype 8.7% , cg genotype 47.1% , and gg genotype 44.2% ;  = 3.48 ; p = 0.06 ) and controls ( genotype frequencies : cc genotype 9% , cg genotype 48% , and gg genotype 43% ;  = 1.46 ; p = 0.22 ) ] .
