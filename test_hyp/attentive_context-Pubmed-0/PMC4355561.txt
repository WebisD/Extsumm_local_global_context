the present analysis showed a regulation , up and down , of many more transcripts in the cd8 conventional dendritic cells of the lung tissue as compared to the cd8 dcs supporting the pathophysiological predominance of the cd8 subset .
surprisingly , the transcriptional reaction in the dendritic cells of the draining lymph nodes was moderate indicating the role of the lymph nodes more as a stabilizer or controller than as a booster of the allergic inflammation .
dendritic cells are present in low numbers in lung tissue and in very low numbers in lung - draining lymph nodes .
our approach to the gene expression of conventional dendritic cells compared cd8 and cd8 conventional dendritic cells , revealing an interesting panel of regulated genes .
dendritic cells and their subsets play a key role in initiating and maintaining allergic inflammation .
the dendritic cells isolated and analysed in this study were the so - called conventional dendritic cells , which are positive for cd11c and mhcii .
conventional cd8 and cd8 dendritic cells are distinct subsets with differentiated roles in allergic inflammation .
gene analysis requires the separation of dendritic cells from huge numbers of animals , limiting the analysis of very rare subsets .
