, succinate is reputed not to cross the plasma membrane , but methyl succinate ( a cellpermeant succinate ) has been used to bypass metformin blockade of respiratory chain complex i .
another condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction , succinate can bypass respiratory chain complex i inhibition and restore oxygen consumption . in isolated cells
in this issue of critical care , protti and colleagues   report the effects of metformin on human platelets both in vitro and ex vivo . in vitro experiments
metformin is a biguanide that has been used as a first - line drug for type 2 diabetes treatment since 1957 in europe and 1995 in the us .
currently , the treatment is only supportive : increasing blood pressure with fluid infusion and catecholamines and promoting metformin elimination by renal replacement therapy . restoring atp production during energy failure due to mitochondria dysfunction is still challenging .
moreover , physicians do not really monitor adequately their prescription . as a result , numerous publications reported the association between metformin and lactic acidosis . when a cause of lactic acidosis such as shock state or acute renal failure is present , the responsibility of metformin could be questioned .
