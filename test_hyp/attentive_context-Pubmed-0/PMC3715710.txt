therefore , we aimed to determine the factors affecting the outcome of eswl for unilateral urinary stones in children by reviewing 17 years of experience at samsung medical center .
in our 17-year single - institution experience , most pediatric urinary stone patients ( 58 of 64 [ 90.6% ] ) were successfully treated by eswl alone without additional procedures .
four of 13 patients ( 30.8% ) with stones in multiple locations were treated with additional surgical treatments : two with urs , one with pcnl , and one with urs and pcnl . when the shockwave - related parameters and treatment outcomes were analyzed according to the method of anesthesia , the general anesthesia group was younger ( p<0.001 ) and was more likely to have multiple stones ( p=0.005 ) .
a total of 81 pediatric patients with urinary stones treated by eswl from january 1995 through may 2012 at samsung medical center were retrospectively reviewed .
multiplicity ( odd ratio [ or ] , 0.080 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.012 to 0.534 ; p=0.009 ) and large stone size ( or , 0.112 ; 95% ci , 0.018 to 0.707 ; p=0.020 ) also decreased the success rate within three eswl sessions ( table 5 ) .
