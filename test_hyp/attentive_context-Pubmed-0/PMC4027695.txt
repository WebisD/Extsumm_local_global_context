a 15-year old boy attempted suicide by taking a high dose of disulfiram ( 20 mg ) . upon arrival at the hospital , he was alert and vital signs were stable .
disulfiram is metabolized to cyanide disulfide ( cs2 ) and produce lesions at the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata in monkeys.7 in huans , pallidal or lenticular lesions after disulfiram intoxication have been reported.6,7 however , to our knowledge , lesion at the substantia nigra after disulfiram intoxication is rarely documented on brain mri studies .
ogc occurs frequently in association with neuroleptic treatment , postencephalitic parkinsonism , and focal brain lesions at the putamen or globus pallidus.1,2,4,5 these findings suggest that ogc can be caused by basal ganglia dysfunction , particularly of the dopaminergic system . in our patient ,
we reported a patient who developed disulfiram induced parkinsonism , dystonia , and ogc , responding markedly to the anticholinergics treatment .
t2-weighted brain mri studies showed high signal intensity lesions at the bilateral globus pallidus and left substantia nigra ( figure 1 ) .
levodopa treatment was not effective , but the frequency of the attacks decreased markedly after trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride ( 2.5 mg tid ) treatment . also , the foot dystonia improved partially and the patient could walk a short distance without assistance .
