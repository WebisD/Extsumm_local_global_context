we report 3 adults with acute encephalopathy ( altered consciousness , confusion ) associated with influenza .
the low csf drug - penetration , together with high cytokines in csf and symptom progression despite drug withdrawal suggest that the manifestations of patient 3 may have been disease - related .
further studies on the clinical spectrum of influenza encephalopathy and encephalitis in adults ( 1,6 ) and their pathogenesis are indicated . in conclusion ,
further investigations on the cns effects of oseltamivir in the clinical setting are needed .. our study is limited by the small patient number and the lack of feasibility in obtaining csf for study / comparison in influenza patients without neurologic symptoms .
at prince of wales hospital , hong kong ( 7 ) , from january 2007 through august 2008 , influenza infection was diagnosed for > 460 hospitalized adult patients for whom acute febrile respiratory illnesses had been diagnosed .
we measured oseltamivir concentrations because of the concerns over its neuropsychiatric side - effects in children and adolescents .
high levels of cytokines ( e.g. , il-6 , soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ) can be consistently found in csf / blood specimens , correlating with disease severity and outcomes ( hyperactivated cytokine response is absent in febrile seizure associated with influenza ) ( 24,8 ) .
