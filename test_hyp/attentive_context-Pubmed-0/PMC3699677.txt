the aim of this paper is to review the clinical findings of recent studies on pd and alpha - synuclein from the perspectives of physicians .
the finding of alpha - synuclein as the main component of lewy bodies has underscored the critical role of alpha - synuclein in the disease mechanism of pd .
these findings are anticipated to aid the development of a premortem biomarker crucial in the diagnosis , clarification of the mechanism , and new treatment methods of pd .
parkinson 's disease ( pd ) is a movement disorder characterized by tremor at rest , rigidity , and bradykinesia and it is the second most common degenerative disorder followed by alzheimer 's disease .
this outcome aligns with the finding of reduced amyloid protein levels in the csf of patients with alzheimer 's disease and has drawn attention to the similarity of two proteins regarding the disease mechanism . in a model of neuron injury by alpha - synuclein
the prevalence of pd increases with age and the incidence is reportedly 1 - 2% over the age of 60 years . a large number of clinical and basic studies have been performed to elucidate the pathogenesis of pd .
