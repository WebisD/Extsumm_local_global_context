a network is generated by determining the first- and second - order interactions of cd proteins associated with a given morphological subgroup in a human protein interaction network consisting of refined experimental proteomics data .
a set of raw candidates were determined by querying all proteins in our interaction network for the amount of interactions to the cd set and determining the hypergeometric probability of this interaction profile .
out of all proteins in the proteome , 49 novel candidates had a significant interaction profile to the cd proteins after adjustment for multiple testing ( described in detail in supplementary information and supplementary figure s5 ) .
the expression levels of the candidates were compared with the expression levels of a different set of 49 randomly chosen controls after normalizing both gene sets against gene expression in glioblastoma tissue . here
interactions of the cd proteins are integrated into a network by always including direct interactions between cd proteins , and only including indirect interactions mediated through proteins with q percent of its interactions to the cd set .
could account for the observed differential expression trends reported by qpcr , we also used polony multiplex analysis of gene expression ( kim et al , 2007 ) to measure the expression of the 49 candidates in right ventricular outflow tract from tof patients at the time of primary surgical repair and left ventricle collected from patients with either heart failure or diabetic cardiomyopathy .
