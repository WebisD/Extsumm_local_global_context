removal of experimental propolis pastes from the root canals was difficult and similar 
 to that observed for calcium hydroxide paste , which is a standard intracanal dressing . 

the purpose of this study was to evaluate the cleaning of the root canal walls after the 
 placement of calcium hydroxide- or propolis - based intracanal medications , using scanning 
 electron microscopy ( sem ) .
group i - no drug ( control ) , group ii - calcium hydroxide / distilled water paste , 
 group iii - propolis paste a70d , group iv - propolis paste d70d .
therefore , the experimental propolis pastes a70d and d70d presented acceptable physical 
 characteristics to be used as intracanal medicaments .
there was no statistically significant difference ( p>0.05 ) among the other groups - 
 group ii ( calcium hydroxide : 142.367.02 ) , group iii ( propolis paste a70d : 12711.69 ) 
 and group iv ( propolis paste d70d : 147.336.51 ) -showing that cleaning of the root canal 
 walls decrease after the use of the intracanal medications .
scanning electron microscopy micrographs representative of the four groups : a  
 control ( no drug ) ; b 
the root canals were dried using 
 conventional paper points , and the teeth were divided into four experimental groups 
 ( n=5 ) .
