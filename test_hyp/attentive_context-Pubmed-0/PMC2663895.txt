a kruskalwallis h test was employed to establish if 1 was equally distributed throughout plant parts ( leafy branches , stem , and root ) ; to determine if plants with high stem concentrations also have high concentrations in the leaf or roots , we calculated a spearman s rank correlation coefficient and tested for significant correlation at the p < 0.05 level .
a chi - square test for independence was employed to ascertain if the occurrence of exceptionally high concentration plants was equal between populations and also to determine if the falealupo population had a greater than expected number of exceptionally high - yielding prostratin plants .
nine stem samples were collected on additional expeditions to the island of tutuila in american samoa in may and november of 2005 for a total of 45 samples including 27 stemwood samples .
the observed concentrations of 1 were ranked , and 95% confidence limits for the distribution of these concentrations around the median were constructed using eq 8.2.2 in snedecor and cochran.(35 ) to determine if the median prostratin ( 1 ) concentrations of all populations were equal , statistical hypotheses were tested using a kruksalwallis h test , the nonparametric analogue of anova .
