factitious disorder ( fd ; pathomimia ) , which has been described as both disease and deception , presents to the clinician as one of the most challenging conditions in medical experience .
only eight individuals have been diagnosed as having fd in this time - frame , and a review of their clinical features and management indicates the use of psychotropic medications based approach for comorbidity and symptomatic treatment .
this is a retrospective study based on screening of all adults seen in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary institution over a 10-year period .
this study from a neuropsychiatric center aims at reviewing the database for the clinical details of patients with diagnosis of fd from the year 2001 to 2010 .
practical difficulties in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in people with fd include factors such as varied presentations in different medical specialities , lesser index of suspicion in specialists , presentation in emergency settings where one can not afford to wait for being investigated extensively to avoid untoward happenings , and lack of thorough knowledge about the symptoms and disease in one who is presenting .
although there are some case reports on fd , there is still a paucity of research .
