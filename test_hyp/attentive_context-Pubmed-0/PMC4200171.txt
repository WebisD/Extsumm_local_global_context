cross - sectional studies show that the prevalence of copd is around 50% of those diagnosed with lc , although the prevalence might change depending on the patient s age , sex , and smoking exposure.15 in recent decades , it has been described that copd is an indicator of greater risk of respiratory complications and that it significantly increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and supraventricular tachycardia in patients undergoing lung resection surgery.68 for this reason , it is not surprising that the assessment of copd in patients with lc has great interest mainly in patients eligible for surgery , since the mortality rates are significantly higher in patients with lc who have other pulmonary comorbidities and therefore higher risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.9,10 so far , most lc studies regarding copd have been focused on the early stages of the disease , trying to prevent complications and mortality related to surgery.9,11,12 despite these advances in surgery and the introduction of new radiotherapy techniques on these days , most lc patients are being treated with chemotherapy or new tyrosine kinase inhibitors , which is the standard treatment for most patients with lc regardless of whether they have copd.13 while it is relatively well recognized that after resection , the prognosis of those with copd is worse than that of those without copd,10,14 in patients with lc not subject to surgery due to advanced stages of the cancer , it is unknown whether copd impacts in the prognosis when they are treated with chemotherapy and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitiors . the objective of our study is to analyze the clinical characteristics and survival rates in patients with lc and copd , and to compare these to the patients without airflow obstruction .
