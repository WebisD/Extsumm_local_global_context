the presence of polymorphisms rs6265 and rs4923463 of the bdnf gene and its correlation with inflammatory and clinical parameters were also assessed .
the levels of bdnf and the inflammatory mediators cxcl10 and tnf- were increased in gg genotype of bdnf rs6265 polymorphism ( figures 3(a ) , 3(b ) , and 3(c ) ) , but mpo levels did not alter significantly ( figure 3(d ) ) . in bdnf
the results obtained here provide a benchmark for future studies with a large cohort of patients to help strengthen and understand the influence of neurotrophins in periodontal disease .
the levels of il-17a , cxcl10 , il-10 , tnf- , and bdnf in periodontal tissues were greater in cp patients than in controls ( figure 1 ) .
the aim of this study was to measure the levels of bdnf in periodontal tissues from patients with chronic periodontitis .
rs4923463 polymorphism the levels of bdnf and mpo did not differ , but the levels of cxcl10 and tnf- were higher in patients with aa genotype ( figures 3(e)3(h ) ) .
the bdnf and il-10 levels in periodontal tissues were negatively correlated ( r = 0.691 , p = 0.002 ) , whereas no correlation between bdnf and il-17a , tnf- , cxcl10 , or clinical parameters was observed ( pd , cal , and bop ) . following the clinical investigation , the frequencies of polymorphisms ( bdnf ) were assessed in blood samples of hc and cp subjects ( table 2 ) . the frequency of these genotypes agreed with the hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( p > 0.05 ) .
