the overall decrease in respiration we detected during sts treatment of pc12 cells can obviously be related to the release of cytochrome c. however , we also found an impairment of the uncoupled respiration occurring in the first phase of sts - induced apoptosis and preceding the release of cytochrome c. this phenomenon was also reported in 143b cells , while in anti - fas antibody - treated jurkat cells , the loss of tmpd - dependent and of endogenous respiration occurred nearly simultaneously and followed cytochrome c release from mitochondria .
this difference in the sequence of events might rely on different pathways taking place in fas- and sts - induced apoptosis . regarding the cause of this early respiration impairment independent of cytochrome c release ,
this finding may shed new light on the mechanisms leading to the release of cytochrome c. indeed , considering the interdependencies existing between bioenergetics and apoptosis , their coinvestigation in a holistic approach is strongly needed .
, we found that mitochondrial bioenergetics is perturbed previously and independently of the release of cytochrome c during apoptosis .
indeed , cl is intimately linked to the mitochondrial bioenergetic machinery and is also actively involved in the release of cytochrome c. it has also been demonstrated that the modifications of the binding between cl and cytochrome c and also the binding between cl and some bcl-2 proteins precede and prime mitochondria for momp and for cytochrome c release .
