early studies concerning the developmental biology and immunology of the apicomplexans have provided valuable insights into the immune mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of parasite growth and development and in the establishment of host resistance to infection   .
it is hoped that unravelling the proteomes and genome sequences of these protozoan pathogens will facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the infectious process and lead to the design of new effective control strategies .
efforts by research laboratories across the globe have demonstrated that , in order to control the infection , both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are crucial for resistance and cross - protection .
it is , therefore , of great hope that in the battle against these pathogenic protozoan parasites , including plasmodium , cryptosporidium , and toxoplasma , the completion of their genomes and proteomes may provide information needed to design vaccines , assess the effects of immunization on parasite pathogenicity and the selection of unwanted mutants , and in the final analysis control the diseases caused by this class of parasites .
it also addresses the evolutionary relationship of these parasites and their hosts and the modulation of the host immune response that are critical in determining the outcome of an infection .
