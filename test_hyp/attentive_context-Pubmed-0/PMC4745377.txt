the eye is an immune privileged site where the introduction of antigens does not elicit an inflammatory immune response .
in conclusion , several lines of evidence provide compelling evidence for a role of the il-20 family of cytokines in glaucoma .
this may lead to the development of novel therapeutic treatments to maintain tissue homeostasis and prevent glaucomatous vision loss in this large oregon poag family .
in addition , low expression of major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii molecules limits antigen presentation to immune cells reducing the chances of an immune response .
first , we have identified a mutation in il-20rb at a residue that is critical for binding of the receptor to the il-20 family of cytokines in a large poag pedigree .
future studies will focus on the role of the il-20 subfamily members in both aqueous outflow regulation in normal trabecular meshwork and their anti - inflammatory role in the posterior tissues of the eye .
a regional immune system provides a second multilayered defense in case the blood - ocular barrier is breached .
third , il-20 family members and their receptors have altered expression levels in the retina and optic nerve head of the dba/2j mouse , which develops glaucoma - like symptoms with aging . while the il-20rb mutation most likely is not a causative factor in the majority of glaucoma cases , the identification of this mutation has revealed that defective il-20 signaling may lead to glaucoma in this large poag pedigree .
