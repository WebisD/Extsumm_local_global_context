studies have proposed that flooding created new pools of water suitable for mosquito larvae as the water levels slowly receded from alluvial forests along the rio branco river in roraima and the maroni river on the frontiers of suriname and french guiana ( 6,15 ) .
further research is needed to address the limitations of our study , including its short time frame and the crude countywide approximation of percentage wetlands as an exposure .
our results suggest that monthly precipitation along the amazon basin can have both strong positive and negative associations with malaria incidence .
our findings show the need to account for local landscape characteristics , especially the extent of wetlands and open water , in regional to global projections of the effects of climate change on malaria .
we used monthly reports of slide - confirmed malaria and annual census  based population data from 434 counties ( municpios ) in the brazilian amazon region for 19961999 , during which no coordinated national malaria interventions occurred ( 12 ) . to study the relationship of reported malaria cases to climate , we used monthly precipitation and temperature from the cru ts 2.1 gridded climate data set for selected states ( 13 ) ( figure 1 ) . to consider how the precipitation  malaria relationship depends on surface water conditions ,
