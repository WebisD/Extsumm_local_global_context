this approach can be effectively use for the oral administration of ds to enhance its therapeutic efficacy .
mmt content in ds - mmt - al composite beads regulate the release rate of ds .
a possible explanation to this behavior is the presence of more hydroxyl groups on the surface of mmt facilitating hydrogen bonding with ds .
intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces between al and mmt were confirmed by ftir studies . the possible structural model of the mmt - al composites
al , mmt - al and the degradation of ds from ds - mmt - al was observed over a range of 200 - 500 while al moiety was degraded 550700. the degradation of alginate in mmt - al was not prominent , may be due to the reinforcement of cross linked ca - alginate by mmt , and therein increases the thermal stability of mmt - al composite .
there was an increase in the release rate of ds from ds - mmt - al composite beads with an increase in the mmt loading .
the ds encapsulation efficiency was lower in the case of virgin al beads as compare to ds - mmt - al composite beads .
