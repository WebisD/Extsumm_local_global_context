patients with end - stage heart failure on lvad therapy demonstrate significant time - dependant changes in hemostasis parameters that could be attributable to the risk of developing both thrombotic and bleeding events . however , further studies are needed to determine whether these changes could serve as biomarkers of such events .
therefore , we set out to determine time - dependant changes of selected hemostasis parameters in patients with end - stage heart failure treated with mcs and antithrombotic therapy .
we set out to determine time - dependant patterns in hemostasis parameters in patients with end - stage heart failure treated with lvad .
sixteen patients with end - stage heart failure on lvad were followed for 6 weeks ( six blood samples for each patient ) . given the various effects of continuous - flow lvad and pulsatile - flow lvad on hemostasis , we included in the current study only continuous - flow lvad recipients .
baseline clinical characteristics coagulation assay results in studied patients time - dependant changes in platelet function
finally , despite the fluctuation in hemostasis parameters , there were no hemorrhagic or thrombo - embolic events during the study period .
