the introduction of imatinib mesylate ( gleevec or glivec ; novartis ) , a small - molecule selective inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases , has revolutionized the treatment of gists , both in the adjuvant setting and in advanced ( i.e. , inoperable and/or metastatic ) cases . on the basis of recently published results of a clinical trial comparing 12 and 36  months of adjuvant imatinib therapy , demonstrating clinical benefit of longer imatinib treatment in terms of delaying recurrences and improving overall survival ( os ) , both the us food and drug administration ( fda ) and the european medicines agency ( ema ) have updated their recommendations and approved 36  months of imatinib treatment in patients with v - kit hardy - zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( kit)-positive gists ( also known as cd117-positive gists ) at high risk of recurrence after surgical resection of the primary tumor .
gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gists ) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract , with a mean annual incidence of 1015 cases per million people , affecting mainly older individuals at a median age of 5565  years   .
the prognosis of patients with inoperable or metastatic gists was poor until the beginning of the 21st century , when significant progress in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of gists resulted in development of a treatment that has become a model of targeted therapy in oncology .
