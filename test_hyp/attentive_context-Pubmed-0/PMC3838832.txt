comparison of the concentrations of serum laboratory parameters between the two groups with lower mediterranean dietary score and group with higher dietary score showed no significant differences between the concentration of albumin , last fasting blood sugar , last creatinine , and lipid profiles ( table 3 ) ; however , serum magnesium concentration in the group with dietary score between 5 and 10 was lower than that in group with higher score ( p = 0.026 ) .
although the main dietary regimen of iranian population is mediterranean diet components especially the major sources of magnesium , the rate of coronary artery disease ( cad ) risk factors among this population has been considerably high . therefore , in the present study , we tried to determine effect of mediterranean dietary approach on laboratory parameters related to cad risk factors with the focus on serum magnesium concentration among iranian patients with cad .
linear multivariate regression analysis also showed that the lower mediterranean dietary score was a predictor for serum magnesium concentration after adjusting for confounders ( table 4 ) .
baseline characteristics and clinical data of 102 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of cad and candidates for isolated coronary artery bypass surgery were entered into the study .
