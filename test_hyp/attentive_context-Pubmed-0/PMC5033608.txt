we present a case in which sd - oct was used to diagnose an asymptomatic pituitary macroadenoma .
sd - oct identified atrophy of the ganglion cell and nerve layers , with preservation of outer layers bilaterally .
spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( sd - oct ) is able to identify retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) and ganglion cell loss in the retina .
sd - oct is able to identify rnfl loss in eyes with band atrophy of the optic nerve , which correlates with visual field defects found in perimetry .
most pituitary adenomas are clinically inactive . in patients with long - standing compression of the optic chiasm , ganglion cells may undergo axonal degeneration .
sd - oct can help in the diagnosis of adenomas in equivocal situations in which there is only subtle optic nerve pallor in the setting of nonspecific visual complaints or visual field defects , or when patients are referred to screen for subclinical compressive optic neuropathies .
sd - oct is a useful tool to assess the structural and functional damage of ganglion cells . in our case
as macroadenomas enlarge , they can induce uncrossed axon loss , resulting in nasal field defects and reduced visual acuity . in these cases , there is atrophy of the nasal and temporal portions of the optic disc , thus occupying a horizontal band across the disc .
