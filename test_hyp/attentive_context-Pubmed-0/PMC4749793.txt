we hereby conclude that early detection and close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance which is now a global problem .
hence , this short term study was undertaken to detect the incidence of mdr , xdr , and pdr bacterial isolates in a tertiary care hospital of central india .
similarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) . in the present study , 137 ( 18.4% )
275 patients were admitted to nicu , of whom 29 ( 10.5% ) were positive for mdr strains and 10 ( 3.6% ) were positive for xdr strains . out of total 1907
the percentage of mdr and xdr strains isolated from different icus was 72/138 ( 52.2% ) and 26/138 ( 18.8% ) , respectively , which were again much more than mdr and xdr strains isolated from wards 321/742 ( 43.3% ) and 120/742 ( 16.2% ) , respectively .
out of total 9304 patients admitted , 393 ( 4.2% ) and 146 ( 1.6% ) were positive for mdr and xdr strains , respectively .
