for example , in the mr analysis , 3.6% of fsc patients , 4.7% of tio patients , and 7.3% of ipr patients had one or more ed visit ( p < 0.001 for all differences between tio and fsc and between ipr and fsc).19 in the tio - fsc psm analysis ,
the tio and fsc groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics ; the groups were different only in mean copd - related outpatient visits ( p < 0.001 ) . matching between the ipr and fsc patients
for example , in the mr analysis , the statistically significant hospitalization / ed visit ors for tio and ipr ( with respect to fsc ) are 1.28 and 1.72 , respectively ; these values are 1.21 and 1.67 in the psm analysis , respectively .
involved more factors . after matching , differences were present for some baseline characteristics : mean copd - related outpatient visits ( p = 0.02 ) , mean all - cause outpatient visits ( p < 0.001 ) , and mean days supply of sabas ( p = 0.007 ) .
in contrast to the mr analysis , the psm analysis found no difference in the percentage of patients with a hospitalization ( p = 0.25 ) or outpatient visit associated with an oral corticosteroid ( p = 0.08 ) .
