there are different opinions on the amount and concentration of dye required , and exposure duration in the vitreous space . in many studies , because of intraretinal accumulation of icg and its toxic effects on retinal pigment epithelium , visual field defects after surgery and possible optical nerve atrophy have been considered.8,10,11 recently , brilliant blue ( bb ) has been used in preclinical studies as it has minimal toxic effect and provides effective membrane staining.9,12 in this study , the anatomical and visual outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy ( ppv ) and ilm peeling with bb in the treatment of idiopathic macular holes has been examined .
ilm peeling in macular hole surgery provides beneficial effects on anatomical outcome , independent of disease stage . in terms of visual outcome
increase in visual acuity between 6 and 12 months after surgery was statistically significant due to cataract surgery ( p < 0.05 ) . in stage 3
postoperative mean best - corrected visual acuity ( and comparison with preoperative values ) was obtained as : 0.48  0.26 at 3 months ( p < 0.05 ) , 0.52  0.27 at 6 months ( p < 0.05 ) , 0.42  0.30 at 9 months ( p < 0.05 ) , and 0.41  0.31 at 12 months ( p < 0.05 ) . when assessed together , the final visits ( at 12 months ) demonstrated that visual acuity had increased in 41 eyes ( 82% ) , whereas , in 6 eyes ( 12% ) , visual acuity remained unchanged . because of recurrent macular holes , three cases showed a decrease in visual acuity .
