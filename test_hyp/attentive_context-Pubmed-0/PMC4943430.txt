a 53-year - old male patient from gujarat ( india ) , with a history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism , and a stable dilated cardiomyopathy was shifted to our hospital with a prolonged pyrexia , which had remained undiagnosed and unresponsive to standard antimicrobial treatment .
it is very important to distinguish m. abscessus from other nontubercular mycobacteria ( ntm ) as antimycobacterial therapy is significantly more complex .
endocarditis caused by m. abscessus generally has a very poor prognosis despite combination antimicrobial therapy , as only two of the 10 documented cases described in the literature have survived after treatment .
a repeat 2d echo at our center showed an evidence of mild aortic regurgitation with three discrete small mobile vegetations on the left and right coronary cusps of the aortic valve .
subsequently , the patient developed worsening cardiac failure and died of pulmonary edema and renal dysfunction despite aggressive medical management in a local intensive care unit .
surgical intervention to replace the infected valve would have been worth attempting if the patient had been willing . however , in view of the dismal treatment outcomes shown by previous studies , it remains uncertain if early institution of appropriate therapy or valve replacement would have altered the ultimately fatal outcome with this pathogen .
