this study investigated 
 the ability of alkb to repair the acrolein- 
 and mda - derived exocyclic dg lesions in single - straned ( ssdna ) or 
 double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) .
additionally , 
 the ability of alkb to repair the open - ring forms of exocyclic guanine 
 lesions suggests that alkb may also modulate the toxicity and mutagenicity 
 associated with the formation of inter- and intrastrand cross - links generated by the open - ring forms of the acrolein- and mda - derived 
 exocyclic guanine lesions .
given that alkb has nine mammalian homologues ( abh18 , fto ) , it is anticipated that these repair pathways 
 may also be operating in mammalian cells ; however , the extent to which 
 these pathways play a role in modulating the mutagenic and carcinogenic 
 risk associated with exposure to acrolein and inflammation - derived 
 mda is not known and remains to be established .
we established that all three exocyclic 
 dg lesions can exist in open - ring forms in the sequence context studied , 
 and we also investigated whether these open - ring forms are substrates 
 for alkb repair . using high - resolution quadrupole time - of - flight ( q - tof ) 
 ms , we found that alkb can oxidize all three exocyclic dg adducts , 
 in both the open- and closed - ring forms .
