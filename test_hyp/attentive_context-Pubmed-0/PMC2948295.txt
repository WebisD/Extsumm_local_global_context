the authors have financial interests in safer sleep llc , which produces a system to promote safety in anesthesia .
, this assertion has been questioned by lagasse , who argues that the definitions of anesthetic mortality used in different studies over the years have not been consistent .
the safe surgery saves lives initiative   of the world health organization has developed a surgical safety checklist to address some of these errors through a cost - effective tool applicable to surgery and anesthesia everywhere . in a study undertaken in eight pilot sites around the world , introduction of this checklist significantly and substantially reduced harm associated with surgery .
it is widely believed that the rate of mortality associated with anesthesia is steadily decreasing , and that anesthesia today is very safe indeed . however
there is now a considerable onus on senior clinicians to promote the use of the checklist in a meaningful manner involving the engaged participation of all members of the operative team .
fundamental to any discussion of the safety of anesthesia is the matter of when mortality should be attributed to anesthesia .
this european study also confirms earlier evidence   suggesting that anesthesia makes an important contribution to outcome after surgery .
