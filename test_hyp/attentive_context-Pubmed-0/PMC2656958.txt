revision internal fixation with cancellous or muscle pedicle bone grafting ( vascularised bone graft ) or an osteotomy results in useful outcome .
we report a case of non - union of the fracture of the neck of the femur , who refused additional procedures after his non - union had been established .
a 38-year old male businessman reported to the out door department of our hospital with a history of a fall from height .
our case demonstrates that as long as the implant is holding and the patient is regularly followed up good results might be expected in cases as far as 32  months into the post fixation period .
non - union after femoral neck fracture can be defined as a lack of radiographic evidence of union 6  months after the fracture .
non - union usually can definitely diagnosed within a year of fracture fixation with the same being achieved within 3  months at times . after non - union has been established , intervention is inevitable .
twenty - six  months into the post operative followup the patients pain subsided and radiographs started showing signs of union . a radiograph taken 32  months after the fixation showed full union .
