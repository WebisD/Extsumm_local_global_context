data from 16 ( srl ) and 29 ( oc ) subjects who were not recommended for colonsocopy . some of the patients were not recommended for more than one reason , causing the total number of reasons that patients were not recommended for colonoscopy ( srl , n  =  18 and oc , n  =  30 ) to be higher than the total number of patients who were not recommended for colonoscopy ( srl , n  =  16 and oc , n  =  29).abbreviations : srl  =  standard referral letter screening ; oc  =  7,5  min outpatient consultation ; ibd  =  inflammatory bowel disease . significance ( p  <  0.05 ) 
 the assessment of the priority of outpatient colonoscopy based on srl and oc plotted against the number of malignancies found at colonoscopy .
the accuracy of prioritization was demonstrated in that the number of patients in level a and b decreased while the number of patients with colorectal cancer in those levels increased .
after the introduction of the screening program for colorectal cancer ( crc ) in the netherlands , the benefits of the oc will increase , because the number of patients authorized for colonoscopies will increase by 66,000 annually in the long term 7 . reducing the number of non - screening colonoscopies by using oc reduces the workload and the financial consequences
