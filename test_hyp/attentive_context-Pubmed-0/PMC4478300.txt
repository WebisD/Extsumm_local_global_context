we describe such a case , where a free - floating iris cyst within the anterior chamber was observed in the setting of recurrent iritis .
we also discuss the complications , significance of iritis and management of free - floating iris cysts .
a 39-year - old male with a 5-year history of mild recurrent iritis ( 6 episodes ) affecting the right eye was found to have a free - floating iris cyst of approximately 0.5 by 0.8 mm within his right anterior chamber ( fig .
an ipe cyst may dislodge and pass from the posterior chamber through the pupil , resulting in a free - floating cyst in the anterior chamber .
the paucity of available evidence means that the association between recurrent iritis and the development or progression of free - floating iris cysts remains inconclusive .
primary iris cysts may arise from either the iris pigment epithelium ( ipe ) or the iris stroma   . in rare instances ,
primary cysts have no clear aetiology and tend to arise spontaneously , while secondary cysts result from a known aetiology such as trauma , surgery or medications   .
mobilisation of the cyst occurred with head tilt but never caused pain or visual compromise ( fig .
