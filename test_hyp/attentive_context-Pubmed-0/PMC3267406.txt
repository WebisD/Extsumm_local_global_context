moreover , we correlated the changes in angiogenesis with the changes in bacterial density ( bd ) in the same cutaneous lesions .
moreover , this combination showed an advantage of rapid elimination of m. leprae from the cutaneous lesions of lepromatous leprosy patients and decreased the possibility of the occurrence of lepra reaction .
the synergistic antiangiogenic effect of both minocycline and rifampicin was found to be promising and effective in the treatment of leprosy .
it was proposed that there is a significant correlation between angiogenesis and bacterial load in cutaneous lesions of lepromatous patients.8 in this study we assessed angiogenesis in lepromatous leprosy patients before and after treatment with mdt alone and in combination with minocycline , a drug known to have an antiangiogenic effect .
the incidence of leprosy has declined worldwide after the introduction of multidrug therapy ( mdt ) by the world health organization ( who ) in 1982;1 however , it is still a public health problem in many countries , which have a high rate of endemic infection.2 this was an indicator to modify or change who mdt , aiming at a more effective , safe , compliant , and shorter - duration regimen that is free from the fear of the emergence of resistant lepra bacilli.3 advances in , and deep understanding of , immunology , pathogenesis , and genetics of leprosy could improve the ability to fight against this potentially devastating infectious disease and may lead to the development of better protocols for treatment and prevention of the disease.4 the status of dermal vasculature was considered an important underlying pathogenic factor in leprosy , and the study of dermal vascular changes in leprosy was a matter of interest in previous reports.5 it was observed that there is narrowing , tortuosity , dilatation , or occlusion of the skin s blood vessels of lepromatous leprosy patients , especially those located in the extremities.6 it was proposed that there are two microvascular architectural patterns observed in cutaneous lesions of leprosy : a dense and tortuous mesh of microvessels among the granulomatous infiltrate in lepromatous leprosy and a microvessel network restricted to the periphery of the granulomas in tuberculoid leprosy.7 moreover , the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells result in the formation of new blood vessels from pre - existing vessels , a process that is known as angiogenesis , which has also been studied in leprosy .
