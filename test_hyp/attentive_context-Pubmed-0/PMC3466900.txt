we report a pregnant woman who presented with signs and symptoms of acute mi and whose ecg findings and troponin 1 level were compatible with mi , leading to the final diagnosis of prinzmetal s angina .
a 35-year - old woman , gravid 3 ( with a history of two cesarean section operations ) , developed acute mi at the 30 week of gestation .
the risk of myocardial infarction ( mi ) in pregnancy is reported from one per 37,500 to 6.2 per 100,000 deliveries.13 the diagnosis is by clinical findings , electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , and measurement of the serum level of the cardiac specific contractile protein , troponin 1.4 , 5 the most common forms of angina are stable and unstable angina , which are usually due to atherosclerosis . but coronary spasm , coronary dissection , and thrombus have been reported as other causes.6 , 7 prinzmetal s angina ( variant angina ) is rare and it accounts for only 2 out of every 100 cases of angina .
last but not least , asymptomatic rca spasm , detected in the last angiography , was another clue to the propensity of the coronary arteries to vasospasm , which is the sine qua non of prinzmetal s angina .
