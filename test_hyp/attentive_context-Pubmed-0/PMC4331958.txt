less necrosis , limited loss of cell boundaries and reduced loss of intact hepatocytes were observed .
in conclusion , zmfm extract could protect against oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation and enhancing the effects of enzymatic and non - enzymatic antioxidants .
this was observed in the reduced intensity in liver - tissue degenerative changes . here ,
the liver sections of dimethoateintoxicated rats showed loss of hepatocytes and loss of cellular boundaries and widened sinusoids ; zmfm attenuated the degenerative effects of dimethoate toxicity .
the increases in the total protein and hdl levels in the extract - treated rats possibly suggests the ability of the extracts to slow down dimethoate - damaging effects on the liver .
levels of total protein and triglyceride differed significantly from those in the nc group , as did the levels ldl and cholesterol ( p < 0.05 ) . in the e2 group ,
the thirty adult male rats were divided into six groups of 5 rats each and treated as follows : group 1 - normal control ( nc ) received distilled water , group 2 - dimethoate control ( dc ) received 6 mg / kg.bw.day dimethoate dissolved in distilled water , group 3 - experimental group ( e1 ) received dimethoate(6 mg / kg.bw ) + zmfm ( 100 mg / kg.bw ) , group 4 - experimental group ( e2 ) received dimethoate ( 6 mg / kg.bw ) + zmfm ( 200 mg / kg.bw ) , group 5 - experimental group ( e3 ) received dimethoate ( 6 mg / kg.bw ) + zmfm ( 300 mg / kg.bw ) , group 6 - experimental control ( eo ) received zmfm ( 300 mg / kg.bw ) only .
