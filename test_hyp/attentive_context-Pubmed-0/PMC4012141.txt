to this end , we have combined a detailed phenotypical analysis of b - cell maturation stages , from the bone marrow ( bm ) to the periphery , with a molecular study of ig repertoire and in  vivo b - cell maturation processes in a large cohort of was pediatric patients .
our data show that wasp - deficiency affects critical stages of central and peripheral b - cell differentiation contributing to abnormalities in humoral immunity and b - cell tolerance in humans .
previous findings in was patients   show phenotypical b - cell perturbations in the periphery . in order to evaluate whether an abnormal b - cell development might generate a b - cell repertoire unable to unsure full protection against pathogens and tolerance against self - antigens ,
we reported herein that wasp - deficiency affects many aspects of b - cell development , first in the bm and then in the periphery .
our results in was patients show an early egress of immature b cells from bm leading to an overrepresentation of transitional b cells in the periphery .
b cells from patients exhibit lower motility , migratory and adhesive capacities , likely due to defective f - actin nucleation . in contrast , despite the role of wasp in b - cell receptor ( bcr ) signaling , abnormalities in b - cell activation still remain controversial . a skewed distribution of serum immunoglobulin ( ig ) classes   and the inability to mount a proper antibody response , particularly to t - cell independent ( ti ) antigens , suggest defects in b - cell effector function .
