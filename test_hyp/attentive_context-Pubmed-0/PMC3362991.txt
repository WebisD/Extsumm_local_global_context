despite the small number of studies shedding light on the anti - inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms of the macrolides , there is strong evidence providing support to the benefit of using this type of drug for the long term and in low doses to treat some chronic inflammatory skin disorders .
although additional studies are needed , macrolide therapy in some of chronic dermatoses has the potential of modifying the morbidity and possibly ameliorating the severity of some , but not all , of these conditions .
, a fatal disorder of the airways , following the introduction of erythromycin in its treatment has focused attention of researchers on the anti - inflammatory properties of macrolides . the clinical impact on diffuse panbronchiolitis ( dpb )
effects on the generation and release of various cytokines involved in the inflammatory process have been studied both in vivo and in vitro .
the immunomodulatory activity of macrolides has been a source of mechanistic research as well as clinical research in non - dpb inflammatory airway disease .
the anti - inflammatory effects of macrolides are significant . the historical change in the natural course of diffuse panbronchiolitis ( dpb )
mounting evidence suggests that macrolide antibiotics have both anti - inflammatory and immune - modulatory properties and are thus beneficial to chronic pulmonary diseases such as diffuse panbronchiolitis , cystic fibrosis , asthma , and bronchiectasis .
