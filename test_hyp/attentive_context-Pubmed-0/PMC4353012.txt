in this study , we have identified conditions 
 for the oxidative 
 coupling of o - aminophenols to n - terminal amino acids . 

herein , we report an oxidative 
 coupling pathway that can preferentially 
 modify the n - terminus of proteins with fast kinetics .
this mild bioconjugation reaction enables the facile , 
 rapid modification of proteins to create a well - defined and stable 
 linkage in a single position , and thus should be useful for many different 
 applications in chemical biology and the construction of biomolecular 
 materials .
these groups can be 
 introduced readily in n - terminal positions using site - directed mutagenesis 
 and escherichia coli expression , especially 
 since the methionine residue resulting from the start codon is cleaved 
 when proline is in the second position .
peptide substrates 
 were first used to screen reaction conditions and identify the site 
 of modification . a peptide panel with varying n - terminal residues 

the ability of the n - terminal oxidative coupling method to achieve 
 this in a single , brief reaction step is highly advantageous , and 
 the fact that it can be combined with cysteine modification chemistry 
 provides new opportunities for complex bioconjugate synthesis .
