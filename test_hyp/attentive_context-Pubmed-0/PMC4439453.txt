, we retrospectively evaluated the level of cd44 mrna expression ( its standard form and v3 variant ) and its correlation with different clinicopathological features of patients with escc .
we showed that the simultaneous increased expression of cd44s and cd44v3 genes was associated with clinical features of escc patients .
, we analyzed mrna expression of the stem cell markers cd44s and cd44v3 in tumoral and adjacent non - tumoral tissues of fifty patients with escc .
further detailed studies on a large patient population are required to elucidate the exact role of cd44s and its variants expression to introduce a specific marker for prognosis of esophageal carcinoma .
a significant correlation was detected between the expression of both genes and the depth of tumor invasion ( p=0.001 ) .
eight samples ( 16.0% ) showed overexpression of both genes , whereas 34 samples ( 68.0% ) showed normal or under expression of both cd44v3 and cd44s genes ( table 3 ) .
furthermore , expression of both genes was significantly correlated to the stage of tumor progression ( p=0.03 ) .
the expression of cd44v3 is related to advanced pathological stage and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and plays an essential role in its invasion and metastasis ( 19 ) . in this study
