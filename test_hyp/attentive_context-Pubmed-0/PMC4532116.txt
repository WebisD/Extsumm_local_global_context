extralobar pulmonary sequestration is often discovered at the time of routine roentgenogram of the chest or at the time of repair of associated congenital anomalies such as diaphragmatic hernia and fistulous communication with the gastrointestinal tract because extralobar sequestration rarely presents like the intralobar form with recurrent pulmonary infection .
extralobar pulmonary sequestration is defined as a mass of pulmonary parenchyma anatomically separate from the normal lung . in extralobar
pulmonary sequestration , the tissue has a distinct pleural covering and may be supplied by an aberrant artery from the aorta or its branch , in rare instances , extralobar pulmonary sequestration communicates with the esophagus or stomach .
extralobar pulmonary sequestration with symptoms or discovered at operation for another problem should be excised and it is feasible to observe asymptomatic and definite extralobar pulmonary sequestration without operation .
histologically , the sequestration consists of normal lung elements in an abnormal and disorderly arrangement with a variable presence of cartilage , bronchial glands and alveolar parenchyma .
the pulmonary sequestration is found lying mostly at the left lung base but can be found in the right lung and in the mediastinum at any level from the neck to below the diaphragm .
