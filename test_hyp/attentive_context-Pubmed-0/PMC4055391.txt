moreover , in older adults , substantial variability occurred in the magnitude and direction of shear stress - induced vasodilation in response to single and combined blockade of no and pn synthesis .
we observed that 9 of 16 young and 6 of 9 older adults exhibited an increase in ra fmd in response to combined pn and no blockade , indicating that non - no and pn mechanisms are able to compensate for the loss of these two vasodilators and further supporting the existence of redundant vasodilator pathways in humans .
specifically , we sought to determine whether aging impairs the fmd response that persists following single and combined no and pn blockade .

 conduit artery flow - mediated dilation ( fmd ) is a widely used noninvasive method to assess endothelial function .
single and combined blockade of no and pn synthesis did not consistently reduce ra fmd in older adults adding to the existing literature that no inhibition does not uniformly decrease conduit artery fmd in healthy humans .
furthermore , a large proportion of older adults exhibited increased or minimally reduced ra fmd responses following combined no and pn blockade suggesting the existence of redundant vasodilator pathways and indicating that aging per se does not uniformly impair these pathways .
