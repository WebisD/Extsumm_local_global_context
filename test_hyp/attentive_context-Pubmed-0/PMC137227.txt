this degree of accuracy , coupled with theease of operation of most instruments , has led to the widespread use of pulseoximetry for monitoring patients in the icu .
, numerous studies have focusedon the technical aspects of pulse oximeters and found that these instrumentshave a reasonable degree of accuracy .
pulse oximetry is probably one of the most important advances inrespiratory monitoring . over the last 15 years
perhaps the major challenge facingpulse oximetry is whether this technology can be incorporated effectively intodiagnostic and management algorithms that can improve the efficiency ofclinical management in the intensive care unit .
thedifficulty that physicians have in detecting hypoxemia was recently exemplifiedin a study of over 14000 patients being evaluated at the ucla emergencydepartment .
changes in diagnostic testing and treatment were most likely at ano2 saturation of 89% , and changes were actually less common at lowersaturations , probably because the physicians were able to detect evidence ofhypoxemia without requiring a pulse oximeter . with the proliferation of pulse oximeters in different locations ofthe hospital throughout the 1980s , several investigators demonstrated thatepisodic hypoxemia is much more common than previously suspected with anincidence ranging from 20 - 82%   ( fig .
