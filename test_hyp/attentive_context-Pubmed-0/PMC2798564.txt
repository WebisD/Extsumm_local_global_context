an objective of all health care systems is to maximise the amount of health produced ( allowing for other objectives such as equity ) , it is not surprising that the economic questions most commonly addressed when evaluating clinical treatments are concerned with identifying the most cost - effective ways of producing health .  
growing recognition that resources for health care are scarce has led to broad acceptance that the evidence base should include economic as well as clinical evidence . in the uk , this is reflected in the work of the national institute for health and clinical excellence ( nice ) whose national guidance on health care for england and wales is explicitly informed by evidence of cost effectiveness as well as clinical effectiveness .  
there is now a growing movement toward incorporating the principles of evidence - based medicine in evidence - based public health . at the end of 2005
, nice announced that it was extending its remit to include guidance on the promotion of good health and the prevention of ill health   thus explicitly recognising the contribution of public health in improving health .  
public health programmes can have nonhealth benefits which may not be captured when a cost effectiveness / cost utility approach to economic evaluation is undertaken .
