we aim to ( i ) calculate the proportion of newly detected cases , ( ii ) assess feasibility of large - scale screening with a single - lead ecg device during influenza vaccination , ( iii ) evaluate the patient characteristics most predictive for a new screen - detected diagnosis of af , ( iv ) determine the cha2ds2-vasc score of novel screen - detected cases and compare these with known cases with af who received influenza vaccination , and ( v ) identify enablers and barriers to the implementation of screening with the mydiagnostick during influenza vaccination .
screening with a single - lead ecg device during influenza vaccination in primary care resulted in 1.1% new cases of af and is a feasible option for large - scale screening .
the unadjusted odds ratios of a new screen - detected diagnosis of af were 9.78 ( 95% ci 3.3828.33 ) for a history of stroke or tia , 0.65 ( 95% ci 0.321.31 ) for male gender , 1.09 per year for older age ( 95% ci 1.051.14 ) , and 1.83 ( 95% ci 0.853.98 ) for a history of either diabetes mellitus , hypertension , heart failure , or vascular disease .
