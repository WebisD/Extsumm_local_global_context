a 45-year - old man presented to our outpatient department with painless progressive diminution of vision both eyes for the past 10 days .
although ethambutol is the most common antitubercular drug implicated to cause toxic optic neuropathy , it is pertinent to be aware that if withdrawal of one drug does not show visual recovery or there is further deterioration of vision , the possibility of toxicity due to other drugs should be thought of . with our country bearing the brunt of tuberculosis ,
hence , the possibility of toxic optic neuropathy due to linezolid was considered as reported in the literature and linezolid was discontinued ( a total cumulative dose of 126 g had been already consumed by the patient ) .
the most common indication for long - term linezolid therapy in these patients has been infection with methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus . in our case
