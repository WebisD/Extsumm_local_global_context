hormesis as a general principle has never been proven as an umbrella theoretic basis for factors that are absent in the environment .
low - dose impacts may be associated with a higher risk in a state of organ sub - compensation or failure especially in elderly patients .
homeopathy claims a curative reaction from a small dose of a drug of which high doses cause symptoms similar to those from which the patient is suffering .
potentially useful empirical knowledge gathered in homeopathy , alternative or complementary medicine , should be scientifically tested and discussed in the professional literature .
all clinically relevant effects , including hormetic ones , should be tested by the methods of evidence - based medicine .
it is however possible that some empirical knowledge is successfully used in homeopathy unrelated to its axioms   like can be cured with like ,   less is more    or the memory of water .
hormesis has been defined as a biphasic dose - response relationship in which the response at low doses is opposite to the effect at high doses . according to this concept ,
accordingly , practical recommendations should be based neither on the hormesis as a default approach   nor on the  like cures like ,   less is more    or other postulates of homeopathy .
