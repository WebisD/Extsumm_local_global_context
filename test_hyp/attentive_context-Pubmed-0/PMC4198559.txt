the location and characteristics of the lesion , endosonographer 's experience , needle size and type , sampling technique , sample preparation , presence of a cytopathologist for rapid on - site examination ( rose ) , and cytologist 's expertise are considered some of the important factors.1,2 issues related to needle selection will be discussed here .
endoscopic ultrasound ( eus)-guided tissue acquisition is the diagnostic procedure of choice in many diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent structures .
currently , there are three different sizes of commercially available eus fine - needle aspiration ( eus - fna ) needles : 19 , 22 , and 25 gauge ( g ) .
needle selection is a complex process and should be made on the basis of many aspects , such as the location and physical characteristics of the lesion , availability of rose , and clinical needs considering the suspected diagnosis.29
this procedure is well known for its high accuracy and low complication rate ; however , its outcome closely relies on several factors .
the needle size and type can be some of the factors that influence the diagnostic yield of eus - guided tissue acquisition .
