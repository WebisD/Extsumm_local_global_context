we will examine the evidence of asm hypercontractility in asthmatics , explore the potential mechanisms driving it , discuss its relevance , and briefly suggest its role in future asthma therapy .
more recently , asthmatic asm was also found to be abnormal in its functional properties with increasing evidence showing intrinsic heightened contractility independent of other structural cells and independent of the asthma inflammatory milieu . in this paper
although this narrowing is multifactorial in origin , abnormalities of airway smooth muscle ( asm ) structure and function have been identified as one of the main causes . increased asm mass has long been recognized as a major component of airway remodelling   .
asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by variable airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity associated with airway remodelling .
indeed evidence presented here suggests that asm hypercontractility is an intrinsic abnormality in asthma that persists in primary culture in the absence of the asthmatic environment .
improved understanding of the mechanisms driving this hypercontractility will pave the way for future treatments that will address contractility , achieve better relief of airway obstruction , and impact on asthma control and exacerbations .
the above evidence , in our opinion , confirms that asthmatic asm is fundamentally different and hypercontractile and that this hypercontractility is a basic property and is independent from other asthma structural cells and airway inflammation , although in vivo these may play an important role in modulating the hypercontractile response .
