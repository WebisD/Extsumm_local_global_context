the present prospective study endorses the prognostic value of suv in terms of dfs in patients with stage iiib melanoma who have been optimally staged with fdg pet and ct .
if confirmed in larger studies , suvmean could potentially be used , in addition to the number of positive nodes , tumour size and extranodal growth , as a factor in deciding on adjuvant systemic treatment .
the first study was a small retrospective study that showed no significant association between suvmean and survival ( p  =  0.11 ) ; however , dfs was significantly decreased in patients with a high suvmean ( p  =  0.03 ) .
prior to treatment of metastatic melanoma in regional lymph nodes is now performed , determination of suv values would provide additional information at very little extra cost . in conclusion , in patients with clinical stage iii melanoma , a high suvmean was associated with decreased dfs .
we have reported some preliminary data acquired in a retrospective setting suggesting an inverse relationship between tumour fdg uptake in patients with stage iii melanoma who receive surgery with curative intent .
other variables associated with dfs in the multivariable analysis were the number of positive nodes ( hr 1.1 , 95% ci 1.01.2 ; p  =  0.02 ) and the presence of extranodal growth ( hr 3.4 , 95% ci 1.44.2 ; p  =  0.003).fig . 2kaplan meier curves for dfs and dss in patients with a high and low suvtable 2multivariable analyses of dfs and dss for the patients with stage iii melanomavariabledfsdsshazard ratiop valuehazard ratiop valuesuvlow1 ( reference)0.0481 ( reference)0.1high1.74 ( 1.003.00)1.57 ( 0.862.87)adjusted for positive nodes and extranodal growth ( see webtable).adjusted for sex , positive nodes and extranodal growth ( see webtable).divided by the median of log(suvmean )  =  1.86 .
