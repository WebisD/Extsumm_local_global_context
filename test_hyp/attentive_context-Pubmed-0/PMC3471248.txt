bilateral carotid artery occlusion accompanied with basilar tip aneurysm is extremely rare.15 ) it has been suggested that increased blood flow through the vertebrobasilar system , which is the major source of collateral circulation , intensifies the hemodynamic stress on the arterial walls and this may result in the formation of saccular aneurysms.13 ) direct clipping for these aneurysms is difficult and the morbidity is high due to the extensive collateral networks as well as the already compromised cerebral blood flow and high internal blood pressure.2)3)7)14 ) thanks to the development of endovascular techniques , the aneurysms that are difficult to reach by craniotomy can now be treated with excellent results.3)4)6 ) to the best of our knowledge , there have been only seven cases of bilateral carotid artery occlusion with concurrent basilar tip aneurysm not being related to moyamoya disease.5)7)8)11)12)17)18 ) among them , only three cases were treated with coil embolization.7)12)17 ) we report here on a rare case of a ruptured basilar tip aneurysm that was successfully treated with coil embolization in the bilateral cervical internal carotid artery ( ica ) occlusions with abnormal vascular networks from the posterior circulation .
