results of virus neutralization tests for 2 belgian isolates and molecular characterization of the dutch btv strain by the community reference laboratory ( 8) indicate that btv serotype 8 is present in belgium and the netherlands .
, our results suggest that using this test with pooled samples might not detect animals with low viral loads .
btv has been detected and its isolation and characterization have considerably progressed in the first weeks of the epidemics .
our results also indicate the usefulness of rt - qpcr , which detected viral rna in recently infected animals with clinical signs of bluetongue but no detectable antibodies to btv .
one characteristic of the current epidemics of bluetongue is the severity of clinical signs reported in cattle ( 10 ) .
rt - pcr  positive results in animals that are no longer infectious ( 11 ) should also be considered before deciding whether pooled samples are acceptable .
although this observation suggests 1 serotype circulating in northern europe after a common virus introduction , it must be confirmed by detailed epidemiologic studies .
these tests indicated that an outbreak of bluetongue was occurring in belgium . despite high sensitivity of rt - qpcr ( 4 )
