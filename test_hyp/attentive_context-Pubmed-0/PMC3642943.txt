this study was designed to determine the effect of probiotics on lipid profile , glycemic control , insulin level , oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes .
there were no significant differences in total serum cholesterol , ldl - c , and hdl - c levels , between probiotic and placebo groups ( table2 ) . fasting plasma insulin level did not change in probiotic group compared to placebo group ( table2 ) .   the mean parameters in placebo and treatment groups * non - parametric wilcoxon on signed ranks test ; insulin - sensitivity measure : quicki ( quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ) : 1/log ( glucose0 ( mg / dl))+log ( insulin0 ( mu / ml ) ) ; insulin - resistance measures : homa ir ( homeostasis model for insulin resistance ) : insulin0(mu / ml)glucose0 ( mmol / l)/22.5 , firi ( fasting insulin - resistance index ) : insulin0 ( mu / ml)glucose0 ( mmol / l)/25 , bennetts index : 1/log ( glucose0 ( mmol / l))log ( insulin0 ( mu / ml ) ) , insulin / glucose : insulin0 ( mu / ml)-to - glucose0 ( mmol / l ) ratio although mda and il-6 levels were reduced in treatment group , but the changes were not statistically significant ( table 2 ) .
