acute il-6 synthesis provides a warning signal and protects the host from environmental stress , while its prolonged production causes the onset and progression of various autoimmune diseases .
subsequent studies have shown that dysregulation of il-6 production is implicated in the pathogenesis of castleman 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , and various other autoimmune , inflammatory , and malignant diseases   . because of the biological activities of il-6 and its pathological role in diseases , it was anticipated that il-6 blockage would constitute a novel treatment strategy for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases   . to this end
case reports of off - label use or pilot studies have also raised the possibility that tocilizumab could become the biological drug of choice for other systemic autoimmune diseases including sle , systemic sclerosis , polymyositis and large vessel vasculitis . at present , the mechanisms through which tocilizumab exerts its clinical ameliorative effects on phenotypically different autoimmune diseases are not completely understood .
several clinical trials have verified the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for ra , systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and castleman 's disease , resulting in approval of this innovative biologic for the treatment of these diseases .
