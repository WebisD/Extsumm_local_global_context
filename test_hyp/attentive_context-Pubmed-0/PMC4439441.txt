while clinical issues regarding magnesium disorders had received surprisingly little attention until the 1990s , a shift in focus led to some clinical investigations , especially in patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) . in 2012 , several reviews on magnesium metabolism and disorders in magnesium balance were published in a special issue of the clinical kidney journal .
mmol / l ) serum magnesium concentrations ( adapted and reprinted from   with permission from elsevier ) this review examines and reviews the clinical impact of magnesium on the health status of ckd patients , in particular taking into account the influence of magnesium on diseases such as metabolic syndrome , diabetes , hypertension , vascular calcification and cardiovascular events , fatigue and depression all of which are frequently present in ckd patients and/or contribute to ckd progress .
for instance , two cohort studies established hypomagnesaemia as a predictor of mortality ( fig .  1 ) and kidney function decline in ckd patients   as well as mortality in haemodialysis ( hd ) patients .
the clinical role of magnesium in terms of benefits and harms of higher or lower serum magnesium levels continues to attract growing attention in research as evidenced by the increasing literature available on this topic . in ckd patients , vascular calcification , hypertension , diabetes , and diabetic nephropathy
