this will be followed by an overview of upper limb immobilisation studies in healthy adult humans and animals and a discussion as to how the findings from these studies could inspire the creation of a model that , we believe , is likely to be of particular relevance to the context of motor rehabilitation after stroke .
this opportunity for intervention is of paramount importance to the clinical context of cns diseases / disorders , where many different patterns of neural plasticity have been identified , each of which being associated with either positive or negative behavioural outcomes .
fortunately , from that time onwards , with the advent of noninvasive neurophysiological and neuroimaging tools for assessing / altering brain activity / function in humans , and the increasingly greater utilisation of such tools in stroke patients , together with major advances in the development and use of animal models of stroke , the scenario began to change .
thus , it follows from the above that , by identifying neural plasticity and its behavioural correlates , together with an understanding of its mechanisms and likely causal factors , one can develop strategies to enhance adaptive and/or suppress maladaptive brain changes in order to improve the individual 's behavioural capacity .
