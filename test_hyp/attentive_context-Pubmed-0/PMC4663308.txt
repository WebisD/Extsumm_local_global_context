the aim of the current study was to assess the enamel cracks after debonding of brackets bonded with two different adhesive systems and also to evaluate enamel cracks after removing adhesive remnants and enamel polishing .
debonding brackets bonded with maxcem elite resulted in less enamel cracks . removing remnants of adhesives and polishing with a 12-blade tungsten carbide bur did not increase enamel cracks .
maxcem elite has clinically acceptable bond strength and can be used as a routine adhesive for orthodontic purposes .
the result of the independent t - test indicated that the mean shear bond strength of maxcem elite ( the self - adhesive composite cement ) was significantly lower than that of transbond xt ( the adhesive composite ) ( p<0.001 ) .
( 0 , no composite left on the tooth ; 1 , less than half of the composite left on the tooth ; 2 , more than half of the composite left on the tooth ; 3 , all the composite left on the tooth with a distinct impression of the bracket base )
the mann - whitney - u test showed that the differences were statistically significant among the groups ( p=0.0001 ) ( table 4 ) . the adhesive remnant index ( ari ) ( 0 , no composite left on the tooth ; 1 , less than half of the composite left on the tooth ; 2 , more than half of the composite left on the tooth ; 3 , all the composite left on the tooth with a distinct impression of the bracket base )
