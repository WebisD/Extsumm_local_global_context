we present an adult case of acquired open bite associated with tmj - oa treated using miniscrew anchorage .
we showed here that orthodontic correction through molar intrusion using titanium miniscrews was effective for the management of an open bite and clockwise - rotated mandible associated with tmj - oa and jaw deformity .
however , patients with active tmj disease and concomitant or resultant maxillofacial skeletal discrepancies who are treated with orthognathic surgery alone often have poor outcomes and significant relapse.6 - 8 this implies that patients with presurgical tmj symptoms requiring mandibular advancement appear to have an increased risk of condylar resorption.9 in addition , orthognathic surgery requires surgical invasion , which carries risks and can result in significant postoperative discomfort.10 however , no significant alternative treatment for these patients has yet been reported . therefore , we suggest orthodontic treatment for patients with skeletal mandibular retrusion and anterior open bite due to tmj - oa , including molar intrusion , which has a beneficial effect on both esthetic appearance and occlusion . as a result of the counterclockwise rotation of the mandible caused by molar intrusion , the condyle is repositioned , and a functional adaptation in circumoral musculature can be achieved . here ,
