we report herein a rare case of chronic arsenicosis in a patient from rural bengal , whose all features mimic papillon - lefvre syndrome .
it is probably the first case from india having papillon - lefevre syndrome - like presentation in chronic arsenicosis .
therefore , we concluded from this rare case that ( 1 ) this may be a rare papillon - lefevre syndrome - like presentation of chronic arsenicosis or ( 2 ) chronic arsenic exposure ( transplacental and her life - time exposure ) may cause mutation of cathepsin - c gene expressed as papillon - lefevre syndrome .
papillon - lefvre syndrome is a rare disease characterized by skin lesions caused by palmar - plantar hyperkeratosis and severe periodontal destruction involving both the primary and permanent dentitions .
palmoplantar hyperkeratosis is a major manifestation in both chronic arsenicosis and papillon - lefvre syndrome .
papillon - lefvre syndrome , first described by two french physicians papillon and lefvere in 1924 , is an extremely rare genodermatosis inherited as an autosomal recessive trait , affecting children between the ages 14 years .
chronic arsenicosis is a major health and occupational problem in rural parts of west bengal such as in the parts of the gangetic plain of india .
