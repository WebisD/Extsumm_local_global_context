the dose values of some organs despite the large difference between the two methods , was within their tolerance dose and so there will be no concern about elevated risk of radiation induced adverse effects .
the present study sought estimates of the radiation doses received by organs at risk in the frontal lobe radiotherapy with direct measurement on the anthropomorphic phantom using tld dosimetry .
in studying with sino - nasal undifferentiated carcinoma treated using three fields ( weighted anterior field and two wedged laterals ) found that mean dose to the optic chiasm was 54 gy which exceeded from tolerance dose level ; these high doses are in accordance with our study .
were compared in terms of dose distribution and absorbed dose to critical organs using treatment planning system ( tps ) calculation and direct measurement in an anthropomorphic phantom .
absorbed dose to all organs except lenses were at their tolerance dose levels and in the new technique , absorbed dose to chiasma is significantly reduced . among all techniques , technique 2 ( one lateral and an anterior field ) was the best in terms of dose distribution , because of its localized irradiated volume at the side of brain .
