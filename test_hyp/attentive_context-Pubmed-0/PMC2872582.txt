a 39 year old female who was seven weeks pregnant presented to a community hospital emergency department with a first episode of chest pain .
it is important that physicians are familiar with the clinical presentation , risk factors , potential management options and their interactions with both the pregnant female and the fetus .
her past obstetrical history included three pregnancies with one full term delivery , one preterm delivery , and one therapeutic abortion .
a number of therapies ranging from multiple drugs to pci are available for the pregnant patient presenting with acs .
she had a twenty pack per year smoking history and a significant family history of coronary artery disease ( cad ) with her father developing cad in his thirties .
although acs in pregnancy has been historically uncommon , the increasing prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors in women of child bearing age combined with the normal physiological changes of pregnancy will cause the incidence of this presentation to increase in clinical practice .
an echocardiogram demonstrated severe inferolateral wall hypokinesis with a preserved left ventricular systolic function and ejection fraction of 60% with no other abnormalities identified .
pulmonary , gastrointestinal , psychiatric , neuromuskuloskeletal , along with non - ischemic cardiac causes of chest pain must be considered in these patients .
