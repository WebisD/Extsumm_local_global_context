we conclude that the use of midline catheters to replace central lines for difficult intravenous access decreases the rate of clabsi in a ventilator unit in a community hospital .
there was a significant decrease in the total number of catheter days on the ventilator unit in group a from 2408 catheter days in the 1 year ( august 1 , 2011 , to july 31 , 2012 ) before the introduction of midline catheters to 1521 catheter days in group b in the following year ( november 1 , 2012 , to october 31 , 2013 ; p < 0.05 in both groups ) .
this calculates to 3.32 clabsi per 1000 catheter days and 0 clabsi per 1000 catheter days , respectively ( add  ) .
the records of catheter days 1 year before the introduction of midlines ( group a : august 1 , 2011 , to july 31 , 2012 ) and catheter days of 1 year after the regular use of midlines ( group b : november 1 , 2012 , to october 31 , 2013 ) in the ventilator unit were collected ( table 1 ) . during the period from august 2012 to november 2012
