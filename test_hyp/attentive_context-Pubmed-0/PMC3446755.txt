the current study investigates the ability of crp and tnf- to induce papp - a expression in the pbmcs of healthy volunteers .
figure 3 showed that the effects of these proinflammatory cytokines appeared to be at the level of transcription , as the dna - directed rna polymerase inhibitor , actinomycin d , completely prevented crp or tnf- induction of papp - a mrna expression , protein expression , and concentrations in culture supernatants .
the focus of these studies is nuclear factor- ( nf- ) b pathways , a major pathway associated with cytokine stimulation in various cell types .
these results showed that crp or tnf- was responsible for new protein synthesis of the papp - a protein .
the time course of papp - a mrna expression in pbmcs under basal and cytokine - stimulated conditions is presented in figure 1(a ) .
furthermore , inhibitor experiments have been designed to explore the underlying intracellular signaling pathways involved in papp - a expression .
is known about the effect of c - reactive protein ( crp ) and tnf- on papp - a expression in human peripheral blood monocytes ( pbmcs ) .
maximal papp - a protein expression in pbmcs and concentrations in culture supernatants were achieved with crp stimulation by 24 hours and tnf- stimulation by 8 hours ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) , reflecting the changes in papp - a mrna expression . as shown in figure 2 , dose - response experiments confirmed crp or tnf- treatment elicited dose - dependent increases in papp - a mrna expression , protein expression in pbmcs , and secretion in the supernatant after 24 hours .
