the specific treatment of this patient 's phaeohyphomycosis with antifungal medication would not have been possible and years of treatment for idiopathic uveitis may have ensued .
a 67-year - old male presented to the emergency eye centre ( eec ) complaining of a painful right eye of 5-day duration .
it is clear that the patients intraocular inflammation was increasing rapidly and only high dose steroids subdued the response . without sub - retinal biopsy ,
however , this is the first time a subretinal abscess caused by phaeohyphomycosis has been documented in the medical literature .
phaeohyphomycosis is a collective term that describes infection caused by darkly pigmented mycelial fungi , a feature secondary to the presence of melanin within their cell walls .
malignancy was also excluded in several cases , which allowed for a trial of medications such as oral steroids and anticytomegalovirus agents . in this case , it is difficult to postulate whether the final va and outcome have been improved by surgical intervention .
it is possible that , in this patient , the lung parenchyma may have been a source of infection , in the setting of chronic , low level immune suppression / modulation by the methotrexate therapy with reactivation of a previous self - limiting respiratory phaeomycotic infection , with subsequent dissemination .
