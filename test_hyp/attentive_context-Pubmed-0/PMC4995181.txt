many lines of evidence support the proposal that visceral obesity is strongly associated with features of the metabolic / insulin resistance syndrome , and that obesity predicts the development of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) .
therefore , as a first step , our review has been chosen to focus on the role of various sources of ros generated in adipose tissue on inflammation and insulin resistance .
chronic ros production has recently been suggested to be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of obesity - associated insulin resistance .
our review focuses on the pathophysiological roles of ros in adipocytes inflammation ; i.e. , the effects of prolonged ros generation by excess nutrients and the effect of ros unregulated by insulin signaling .
we summarize how these three distinct sources of ros might affect adipocyte insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation in the early , intermediate , and late stages of obesity ( fig .
the presence of systemic inflammation in visceral obesity has been linked to an increased risk of developing cvd and type 2 diabetes .
an overall role of distinct sources of ros for adipose tissue inflammation is that ( 1 ) in the early stages of obesity , nox4-derived ros from adipocytes provoke the onset of insulin resistance and initiates the recruitment of immune cells in adipose tissue , ( 2 ) in the intermediate stages of obesity , nox2-derived ros from infiltrated immune cells worsens adipocyte insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation , and ( 3 ) in the late stages of obesity , mitochondria - derived ros from adipocytes maintain the adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance .
