so , our objective was to determine the localization of intracellular saa in hcaec and to elucidate possible associations of saa with particular cytoskeletal elements .
the expression of saa mrna within cultured human primary coronary artery endothelial cells ( hcaec ) was first reported in 2007   and these cells were also shown to be highly responsive to human recombinant saa1/2 , as an inflammatory stimulus , indicating a strong positive feedback onto its own synthesis . however , very little is known about the localization of saa within these cells , whether it is released and could act locally at the extracellular level or saa remains in hcaec and could influence endothelial function in an intracellular manner .
some of the strongest signals in this study were observed in endothelial cells lining the lumen of coronary arteries and in macrophage - derived  foam cells . 
both murine acute phase isoforms of saa1.1 and saa2.1 bind well to the plasma membrane , with only saa2.1 taken up by the cell at 37c and later detected in the nucleus .
saa localizes with microtubules in untreated hcaec , but not with actin filaments or vimentin .
the acute phase response represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of inflammatory events designed to rapidly react to infections , wounds , and injuries . it can lead to a dramatic increase ( up to 1000 fold ) in the levels of acute phase proteins ( apps ) in the circulation and ,
