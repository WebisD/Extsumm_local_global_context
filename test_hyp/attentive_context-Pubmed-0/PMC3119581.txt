sera from patients with multiple autoimmune diseases have been found to have elevated cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) igm titers , perhaps implying an as yet unidentified association between cmv and autoimmune diseases.7 we present a case of fluorescence ana - negative aih - associated primary biliary cirrhosis ( pbc ) that appears to have been triggered by reactivated cmv infection .
in 2010 , a 63-year - old japanese woman was admitted to a local hospital , after which she was transferred to our hospital for investigation of liver dysfunction .
the most common are antinuclear antibodies ( ana ) , smooth muscle antibodies ( sma ) , and antibodies to liver and kidney microsomes ( anti - lkm).1 evidence suggests that aih is induced by antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity , which involves both antibody - mediated and cellular immunity against specific liver antigens on hepatocyte membranes.2 several studies have documented the involvement of genetic factors including human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) types dr3 and dr4.3 some reports have described aih cases in which a virus such as hepatitis a,4 hepatitis b,5 or epstein  barr6 was the causative agent .
elisa assay for ana and liver biopsy led to aih and early treatment with prednisolone , which produced a good clinical outcome .
