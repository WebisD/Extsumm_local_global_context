hiv diversity plays a central role in the hiv pandemic ; for this reason , it is today imperative that global molecular epidemiology surveillance is continued and improved using rigorous sampling strategies .
the improved knowledge of the significance of non - b subtypes for resistance evolution and interpretation , in response to antiretroviral therapy , disease progression and vaccine design are becoming mandatory today not only because antiretroviral therapy is being introduced in countries where non - b subtypes are driving the epidemic but also because the number of infections by these variants is increasing sharply in previously subtype b homogeneous areas such as europe and north america   .
efforts should be undertaken in diverse human populations infected with a variety of hiv-1 subtypes in order to fully understand the complex interplay of hiv and host in aids pathogenesis .
thirty years have passed after discovering human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , the etiological agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids )   .
it is reassuring that current antiretroviral strategies appear to be effective against a broad spectrum of hiv subtypes .
the increasing prevalence of hiv-1 non - b subtypes could have implications not only for the development of resistance but also for diagnosis , vaccine design , and the clinical management of hiv infection   .
