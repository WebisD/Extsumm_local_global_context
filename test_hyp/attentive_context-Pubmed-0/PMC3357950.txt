we aim at elucidating the phylogenetic position of the utaka within the malawian cichlid radiation and shed light on the causes for its taxonomic and molecular assignment inconsistency .
 virginalis kajose  and  = 0.007 in c. quadrimaculatus , reported in ) , and slightly higher among the two species (  = 0.01 ) . whether this observation might yield a demonstration of the relative ease of hybridisation among phenotypically well - differentiated taxa   or be the result of an insufficient resolution of the markers used , deserves further research .
the paraphyly of the utaka does not represent an artefact in our analyses , as corroborated by the long and well - supported branches that connect the non - mbuna and the virginalis clades , as well as by the significant result of the shimodaira - hasegawa test .
the two lineages have been observed before   but this is the first study to reveal the paraphyly not only of the genus copadichromis in individuals from throughout lake malawi , but also of three ( of the five analysed ) utaka species ( based on the short mtdna sequences ) . in a wider taxonomic context involving the other malawian cichlid lineages , the most abundant of the two lineages in the utaka clustered within the non - mbuna mtdna clade , while the other formed a separate clade containing exclusively utaka specimens , mostly c. sp .  virginalis kajose
