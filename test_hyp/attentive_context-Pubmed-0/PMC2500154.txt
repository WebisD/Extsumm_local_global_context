we 
     report the identification of expression signatures , canonical pathways , molecular networks and 
     drug targets of dysregulated neuropsychiatric disease - related genes in ba46 of postmortem brain 
     tissue from patients with ptsd using a human mitochondria - focused cdna microarray ( hmitchip3 ) 
      24 .
our results indicate mitochondrial dysfunction in 
     the dlpfc ba46 and may prove useful for developing methods for diagnosis and treatment of 
    ptsd .
in addition , 17 ( 61% ) of the 28 genes that were mapped to 
     neurological diseases were known to play a role in survival and apoptosis of a cell . moreover
the lack of a 
     holistic study of all the mitochondria - related genes hinders the progress of the ptsd research . to date , methods employing a systems biology approach to identify the mitochondria - focused 
     genes underlying the pathogenesis in ptsd - related brain regions have not been documented , 
     probably due to the lack of human postmortem brain tissue from ptsd patients .
human brain dlpfc including ba46 is involved in regulation of working memory and preparation 
     and selection of fear responses and has been correlated with structural and functional 
     alterations and treatment response of patients with ptsd 9 - 13 .
