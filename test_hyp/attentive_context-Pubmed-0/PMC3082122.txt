a 24-yr - old male was admitted to a hospital , on august 16 , 2007 , with a 15-day history of abdominal distension .
although l. hongkongensis has been reported in hong kong , china , and hungary ( 3 ) , it has not hitherto been identified in korea .
l. hongkongensis was first isolated from a 54-yr - old chinese male with alcoholic cirrhosis and thoracic bacateremic empyema ( 1 , 2 ) .
extensive epidemiologic studies should be carried out to ascertain the etiologic association between l. hongkongensis and the intestinal normal flora , and to identify the host and the routes of transmission of l. hongkongensis .
the identification based on a molecular approach could permit more accurate determinations of incidence and evaluation of clinical relevance .
it belongs to the family neisseriaceae of the  subclass of proteobacteria ( 1 ) . since the first description of l. hongkongensis from the blood and empyema pus of a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in 2001 , the bacterium has subsequently been associated with community - acquired gastroenteritis ( 1 , 2 )
subsequently , the bacterium has been isolated from patients in other parts of the world .
