the increasing volume of colonoscopy procedures - related with a growing awareness of the efficacy of crc screening - in a period of economic constraint requires a rational exploitation of the limited medical and financial resources .
this is further worsened by the additional volume of surveillance procedure generated by the detection of neoplastic lesions at the screening examination , especially when considering the increase in adenoma detection rate with the evolution of endoscopic technology and the development of quality assurance programs .
any decision - making process in clinical medicine may be simplified in a series of sequential steps that cumulatively lead to a clinical diagnosis or intervention .
it may be estimated that roughly one in every two patients undergoing screening or diagnostic colonoscopy are diagnosed with at least one polyp , thus requiring postpolypectomy pathological examination.7,8 secondly , the vast majority of these polyps are diminutive ( 5 mm ) with a very low prevalence of advanced neoplasia , marginalizing the clinical impact of pathological examination.7 - 9 third , the estimated cost of the pathological examination is of the same magnitude with that of colonoscopy , heavily affecting the cost of colonoscopy screening without adding an equivalent contribution to colonoscopy efficacy.10 - 12 fourth , the need of a new visit for communicating the postpathological surveillance interval generates a substantial and avoidable loss of productivity for the society , especially when considering that roughly 60% of the united states population undertakes a screening colonoscopy every 10 years.13 in order to address these pitfalls , a policy of discarding the postpolypectomy pathological examination has been proposed , also named as predict - resect - and - discard policy.14 - 16 its main assumption is that if endoscopy may predict in vivo the histotype of the polyp , the additional value of histological examination may be marginalized , becoming inefficient and/or cost - ineffective.10 - 12 predict - resect - and - discard policy has been mainly prompted by the technical evolution of endoscopic imaging , leading to a new field defined as advanced endoscopic imaging , with the main aim of differentiating between hyperplastic and neoplastic , as well as between noninvasive and invasive neoplastic lesions.17,18 however , before implementing a predict - resect - and - discard policies , several issues need to be addressed .
