we present a case of retrieval of an embolized amplatzer duct occluder by use of a percutaneous method in a young man .
transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) by use of the amplatzer duct occluder shows good results in properly selected patients.1 the advantages of the amplatzer duct occluder device include a user - friendly delivery system , the ability to retrieve or reposition the device when required , and a high complete closure rate ( > 99% complete occlusion of pda within 6 months of implant).2 although embolization of an amplatzer duct occluder is rare , it can occur .
transthoracic two - dimensional echocardiography and computed tomography ( ct ) confirmed pda ( fig .
transcatheter pda closure is currently the standard of therapy and is performed with high success rates and few complications.3 although the rate of device embolization is rare ( < 0.5% ) , this remains a major complication requiring urgent surgical management.4 the most common cause of embolization is the use of an undersized device .
thus , physicians have to keep in mind both the possibility and the treatment of this severe complication during pda closure .
