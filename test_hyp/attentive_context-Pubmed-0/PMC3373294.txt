was also investigated with a sirna - mediated knockdown study in several human cancer cells.34 currently , we have established ph - sensitive carbonate apatite as a potential tool to efficiently deliver sirna across the cell membrane and silence cyclin b1 gene transcript , thus inducing apoptosis of cervical cancer cells in synergy with anti - cancer drugs.35,36 here , we reveal that carbonate apatite - mediated delivery of the sirna targeting either abcg2 or abcb1 gene transcript in mcf-7 , a human breast cancer cell line constitutively expressing abcg2 and abcb1 transporters , led to an increased chemosensitivity to doxorubicin , paclitaxel , and cisplatin , depending on the doses of the individual drug . moreover , co - delivery of two specific sirnas targeting abcb1 and abcg2 transcripts caused a dramatic enhancement of chemosensitivity activity in mcf-7 cells , indicating the reversal of abc transporter - mediated multidrug resistance .
very recently , small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) , a double - stranded rna of between 2128 nucleotides that selectively degrade mrna and thus block production of a particular protein,32 have been applied in vitro for reversal of abc transporter - mediated drug efflux by targeting both abcb1 and abcg2 transporters . a pioneering study using exogenous sirna demonstrated suppression of abcb1 expression in conjunction with reversal of doxorubicin and paclitaxel resistance in human breast cancer cells.33 reversal of multidrug - resistant abcg2 phenotype
