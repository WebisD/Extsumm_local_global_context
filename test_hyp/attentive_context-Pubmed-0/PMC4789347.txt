we found high prevalence of pvl in mrsa and mssa , as well as the presence of pvl - positive st772 mrsa - v ( bengal bay clone ) .
genetic characteristics were analysed for 17 isolates as representatives of pvl - positive mrsa ( seven isolates ) , pvl - positive mssa ( six isolates ) , pvl - negative mrsa ( three isolates ) and a pvl - negative mssa isolate ( table  2 ) .
in contrast , all the st121 s.  aureus analysed to date harboured ebps - v 
 , , . the st121 clone is known to be a common cause of skin and soft tissue infection disseminating globally , mostly meca negative but pvl positive , exhibiting higher virulence . although the association of ebps - v with the enhanced virulence of the st121 clone is not known , if the presence of ebps - v affects phenotypic trait of st22 s.  aureus ( e.g. virulence or fitness advantage to environment ) , it is possible that the proportions of st22 isolates with ebps and ebps - v may change over time epidemiologically .
the st772 was identified into mrsa with sccmec v , coa - via and agr - ii ( one pvl - negative and four pvl - positive isolates ) , as well as two pvl - positive mssa .
