to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to compare a range of nutritional 
 biomarkers ( 25(oh)d3 , folate and vitamin b12 ) among colorectal cancer 
 patients and controls in different geographical regions .
as we aim to 
 understand predictors of colorectal cancer prognosis , there is much to learn from 
 international cohorts , which offer a broad range of exposure and health behaviours that 
 can not be obtained at a single site .
predictors of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 ( 25(oh)d3 ) , vitamin 
 b12 and folate among colorectal cancer cases and controls * p  <  010 , * * p  <  005 . cases and controls were combined because case status was not statistically 
 significant .
the majority of tumours were of stages iii ( 396  % ) and iv 
 ( 262  % ) . among the cases ,

hypovitaminosis d ( plasma 
 25(oh)d3 < 20  ng / ml ) was more prevalent in tampa ( 54  % ) and seattle ( 50  % ) 
 than in heidelberg ( 23  % ) ( data not shown ) . on the other hand , plasma folate concentrations 
 were , on average , lower in heidelberg ( 111  ng / ml ; range 03482 ng / ml ) than in seattle 
 ( 253 ng / ml ; range 35703 ng / ml ) and tampa ( 238 ng / ml ; range 68697 ng / ml ) .
