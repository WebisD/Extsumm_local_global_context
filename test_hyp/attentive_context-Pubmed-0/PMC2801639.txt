the treatment of lymphoma depends on the type , location and stage of the disease .
hodgkin s lymphoma does not affect the ocular adnexal structures unless there is widespread systemic involvement or a history of previous systemic hodgkin s lymphoma . according to the ann - arbor staging system lymphoma confined to the orbit
requires systemic treatments whereas low - grade ( emzl or follicular cell ) lymphoma localized to the eye can be very successfully managed with local treatments such as cryotherapy , surgical excision or external beam radiotherapy . when considering local treatment it is important to exclude bilateral ocular involvement . even in the absence of clinical signs
the majority ( 50%90% ) of oal is low - grade mucosa associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphoma . according to the world health organization modification of the real classification ,
surgical excision or cryotherapy is most appropriate for localized stage 1 conjunctival emzl / malt lymphoma.1 this is not curative treatment but can control local disease and relieve local symptoms .
the new classification of lymphoma is dependent on histological , immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analysis .
we recommend a diagnostic biopsy with immunophenotyping and genetic analysis to determine the grade of the lymphoma combined with pcr analysis to determine the presence of an infective agent . if h. pylori or c. psittaci infection is found a trial of oral doxycycline ( 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks )
