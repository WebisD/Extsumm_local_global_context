the emma database has two main benefits to the research community : ( i ) scientists with particular gene or genes of interest can discover if any mouse lines exist with mutations in these gene(s ) and what the observed phenotype changes were , which may provide clues to the gene 's role , and ( ii ) it allows scientists to order existing mouse mutants for further research and generation of data of interest to other researchers . as well as providing user - friendly searching and browsing of the database , the emma website is the link to the scientific community and facilitates the submission of mice to the emma and requests of mice from emma , as well as expressing interest in strains currently undergoing archiving . the data recorded for each strain is a combination of data entered by the original submitting scientist as well as subsequent curation to correct and add extra value to the database .
the emma resource database described in this paper provides up to date information about the archiving status of mice and describes the genetic and phenotypic properties of all the mutant strains that emma stocks .
eventually , these four resources will provide access to data and material covering the complete , functional characterised , proteome of the mouse , providing an unprecedented resource for bench scientists studying all aspects of the mammalian genome including human disease .
