the patient described here is therefore the seventh with palmar - divergent dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate . in this patient
, the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments were sutured through the dorsal approach , the anterior capsule was sutured through the palmar approach , and the scapholunate and lunotriquetral joints were fixed with kirschner wires . to our knowledge , this is the first report in which interosseous ligaments were sutured by open surgery for divergent dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate .
simultaneous palmar dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate is rare   and has been classified into two types depending on whether or not the scapholunate ligament is intact .
ten patients with dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate as a unit have been described to date , as well as six patients with divergent dislocation   .
a 46-year - old man who fell from a height of 1.5  m onto his left hand was brought to the emergency center of our hospital and underwent a medical examination .
prc on a patient with a scapholunate dislocation and complete scaphoid extrusion resulted in a good clinical outcome , suggesting that prc may eliminate avascular necrosis and avoid additional surgery in patients with this type of injury .
