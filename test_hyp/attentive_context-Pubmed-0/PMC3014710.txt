, we will outline the pivotal role that lipid rafts play in linking together the generation , self - assembly and toxicity of a oligomers , which underlie the development of the neuropathology in ad .
neuronal lipid rafts are crucial modulators of a production and aggregation , leading to the accumulation of neurotoxic a oligomers in the brain which drive ad pathology .
a oligomer binding appears to induce the aberrant localisation of these proteins with deleterious effects upon their physiological functions including hippocampal ltp , which underlies memory , and defence against oxidative stress . in this way
crucially , all three of these processes occur in lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane which are considered to play a key role in the development of ad . in this paper
, lipid rafts appear to be directly responsible for the transduction of a oligomer - mediated memory impairments and neurotoxicity which characterise ad .
lipid rafts are not only implicated in ad but may also be the key to a range of neurodegenerative proteinopathies , including parkinson 's disease , huntington 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and prion diseases ( reviewed in ) . indeed , lipid raft disruption protects neurons against the toxicity of other oligomers besides a      and lipid rafts may therefore represent generic platforms for oligomer - mediated neurotoxicity .
