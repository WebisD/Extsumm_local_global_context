posterior results for the final bayesian model for showing effective genotypes deletion on mean arterial pressure ( map ) adjusted by bmi , age , sex , and smoking status
in conclusion , the genetic polymorphism of gstt1 and gstm1 by adjusting effect of sex , age , bmi , and smoking status was significantly associated with the average arterial pressure increasing suggesting that the gstm1 and gstt1 genes are the candidate genes that alter bp and subsequently , the susceptibility to atherosclerosis with regard to sex , bmi , and cigarette smoking .
the present study was designed to investigate the association of gstt1 and gstm1 gene polymorphism with bp in the iranian population .
this study has investigated gstm1 and gstt1 gene polymorphisms in iranian population with the incidence of hypertension and demonstrated that both the gstm1 and gstt1 genotypes deletion had a significant effect on the map increasing in our sample based on 95% credible intervals .
the association between the variations in the gst activity in vivo and the susceptibility to cancer , cardiovascular , and other diseases has been studied primarily by the use of homozygous gstm1-null and gstt1-null genotypes , as indicators of a systemic lack of expression of the corresponding proteins .
