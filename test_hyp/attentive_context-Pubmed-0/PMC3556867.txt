the bacterial agents of infectious keratitis that have been studied in considerable detail are three of the most common causes of such infections , namely , staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa .
the fundamental treatment of bacterial keratitis is based on the action of bactericidal antibiotic therapy to eliminate the bacteria that secrete the toxic proteins .
a key issue in treatment is that the cornea has rapidly replicating bacteria prior to the onset of severe symptoms , and later , when symptoms are present , bacteria with a much reduced rate of bacterial replication predominate .
is the emergence of bacteria with greater resistance to those antibiotics that were highly successful for many previous years ; delays in obtaining an effective therapy provides time for the bacterial population to expand and to continue secreting the damaging proteins .
key drugs , such as fluoroquinolones , are far more effective on replicating than nonreplicating bacteria , so the treatment of the cornea needs to be prompt , aggressive , and prolonged
thus , the mechanisms of keratitis have partially evaded the benefit of our current therapies . also problematic
knowledge of the key mediators of tissue damage must be known to allow subsequent development of adjunct therapies to limit the action of these bacterial proteins .
