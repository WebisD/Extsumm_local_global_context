observational studies are also difficult to analyse and interpret because of the heterogeneity of real - life patient populations , the lack of standardised treatment regimens , the lack of standardised indications for treatment , and the lack of predefined endpoints for assessing survival ( e.g. 28 day survival or in - hospital mortality ) . for these reasons
messori and colleagues are to be congratulated on their interesting report on the italian observational study of antithrombin iii ( at iii ) use in intensive care units . audits of this sort are difficult and time consuming to conduct .
surveys and audits are very important ways of documenting routine clinical practice and of confirming the implementation of guidelines based on the results of rcts . surveys and audits are also useful for generating hypotheses , but they are not a substitute for rcts when proving or disproving hypotheses .
as pointed out by pocock and elbourne , observational studies have one crucial deficiency : the design is not an experimental one .
it is not possible to be sure that the findings of an observational study are predictive of the results of a randomised , controlled trial ( rct ) .
