we report cytomorphology in two cases of chondroblastoma confirmed by histopathology with a brief review of literature .
a 16-year - old male presented with pain and diffuse swelling on the knee joint since 2 months .
since last decade , fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) has evolved as a simple , safe , and noninvasive preoperative tool in the diagnosis of bone tumors .
the collective application of the knowledge of the cytomorphological features of this rare bone tumor would aid in accurate preoperative diagnosis even in the absence of typical clinical and radiologic presentations .
this report reiterates the cytomorphologic findings in chondroblastoma and its differential diagnosis from other giant cell containing lesions of bone .
however , errors in the fnac diagnosis of this rare tumor are known to occur , with the major pitfalls being its association with aneurysmal bone cyst ( abc ) leading to a nonrepresentative aspirate and the occurrence of a plethora of giant cell - rich lesions in the differentials .
chondroblastoma accounts for < 1% of all primary bone tumors . usually occurring in young adolescents ,
the diagnosis was missed on fnac , among which , one was associated with abc and in another case an erroneous diagnosis of a giant cell tumor was made .
