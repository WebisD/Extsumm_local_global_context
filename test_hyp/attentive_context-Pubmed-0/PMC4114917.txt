polymorphism in the vntrs within these retrotransposons demonstrates a mechanism not only for differential regulatory function associated with genotype but a way to rapidly integrate polymorphism in the sva element as a potential biomarker for disease association without the requirement for retrotransposition .
in our analysis of the fus sva element we generated reporter gene constructs that were analyzed in both the neuroblastoma cell line , sk - n - as and a chicken embryo model the distance of the sva element from its site of action on a specific promoter or transcriptional start site can be quite large .
in this article we will use the term variable number tandem repeat ( vntr ) to encompass both microsatellites and minisatellites however not all tandem repeat domains are polymorphic in repeat copy number .
they consist of a hexamer repeat ( ccctct ) , an alu - like sequence , a gc - rich vntr , a sine and a poly a - tail as with other retrotransposons much effort has been expended on the retrotransposition event itself giving rise to disease .
it has been demonstrated by us and others when attempting to reproduce endogenous gene expression in transgenic models , that regulatory domains utilized by a locus can be 100kb+ away from the gene itself .
