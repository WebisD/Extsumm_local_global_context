the group of pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) includes families of toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , nod - like receptors , c - type lectin receptors ( clrs ) , and rig - i - like receptors ( rlrs ) .
fundamental studies devoted to the investigation of infectious agent  prr interactions , to the investigation of carcinogenicity of known infectious agents and to the discovery of new , possibly carcinogenic , infectious agents should answer this question . no doubt , determination of the role of snps in genes encoding prrs and proteins of prr signaling pathways in fields of tumor immunology and molecular epidemiology of cancer may open new pages in cancer biology and cancer prevention .
in addition , many prrs have a number of other vital functions apart from participation in immune response realization : they may regulate various aspects of cell proliferation , survival , apoptosis , autophagy , reactive oxygen species generation , pyroptosis , angiogenesis , and , consequently , of tissue remodeling and repair.69 the fundamental characteristics and diversity of prr functions have led to amazingly rapid research in this field , and such investigations are very promising for medicine as the immune system plays a key role in the vast majority , if not all , human diseases , and the process of discovering new aspects of immune system functioning is rapidly ongoing .
