the aim of this study was to investigate characteristics and outcomes of treating pulmonary stenosis with valvuloplasty , and to compare the results among three childhood age groups .
noncardiac coincident diseases included two cases of bilateral tonsillar hypertrophy , one congenital cataract , one case of undescended testis , one hemophilia case , and one case of left sided inguinal hernia .
pulmonary valve insufficiency was observed in 52 ( 59.8% ) patients , 36 patients having mild pulmonary valve insufficiency .
this is due to the possibility of dangerous complications that may emerge if timely treatment is not used.1 balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonary valve stenosis is the treatment of choice for isolated pulmonary stenosis in all childhood age groups.2 the balloon valvuloplasty procedure in treating pulmonary valve stenosis has its origins in the success of surgical valvotomy to relieve the pressure gradient developed across the stenotic pulmonary valve.3 the first catheter attempts to relieve the gradient were described by rubio and limon lason in 19544 and semb et al in 1979.5 the short - term and long - term effects of this therapy are still an area of interest for interventional cardiologists as stronger evidence is needed from studies in different settings and populations .
