porokeratoses are a group of cutaneous entities of unknown etiology , characterized by disordered epidermal keratinization and , at histological examination , by the presence of coronoid lamella , a column of parakeratotic cells extending through the stratum corneum

only 7 cases of this association have been described in the literature ( table 1 ) .
we also suggest utilization of moabs for ck5 as a first - line target in these conditions , encouraged by the immediate and strong positivity of this protein in immunohistochemical studies , whereas pan - cytokeratin at first produced negative results .
in 1937 , andrews first described dsp and introduced this term to indicate a clinical variant of mibelli 's porokeratosis . later , chernoski and freeman proposed a possible actinic etiology of this dermatosis and coined the term disseminated superficial
