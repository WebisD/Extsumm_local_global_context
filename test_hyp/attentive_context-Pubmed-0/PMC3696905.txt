we then applied this triple imaging system to monitor the effect of adeno - associated virus ( aav)-mediated soluble tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( strail ) therapy against intracranial glioma tumors .
tumor formation is a complex process , concurrent measurement of several events will be important for the development of novel therapeutics and their transition to the clinic . in this study , we have characterized a codon - optimized vargula hilgendorfii luciferase ( vluc ) for mammalian gene expression , and showed that this luciferase can be multiplexed with gluc and fluc for sequential imaging of three different biological processes in the same biological system .
we also showed that this triple bioluminescence imaging system yield specific , and detectable bioluminescence signal in deep tissues such as the brain ( with intact skull , ~3.5  mm ) of mice .
bioluminescence imaging ( bli ) using luciferase reporters has been indispensible for noninvasive monitoring of different biological processes such as tumor volume and transcriptional activation during tumor development / therapy , as well as immune cell infiltration into the tumor environment . unlike end - point analysis
the present study demonstrates for the first time a triple luciferase reporter system for in vivo bioluminescence imaging .
