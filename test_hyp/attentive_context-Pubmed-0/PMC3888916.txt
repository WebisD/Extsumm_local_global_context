therefore , we sought to investigate the relationship between efv level and ccc in patients with cad .
the variables that were found to have significance in the univariate analysis ( preinfarction angina , rdw , mpv , tg , body mass ndex ( bmi ) , hs - crp ) were included in the multivariate model . among those , efv ( or : 1.059 ; 95% ci ( 1.035 1.085 ) ; p = 0.00 ) , presence of angina were found to be the independent predictors of adequate ccc . in receiver - operating characteristic curve analysis ,
our study demonstrated that the presence of angina and high efv levels may serve to be independent predictors of adequate ccc .
compared to the patients with adequate ccc , patients with impaired ccc exhibited higher red cell distrubution width ( rdw ) , mean platelet volume ( mpv ) , triglyceride ( tg ) , hs - crp values and frequency of bmi and preinfarction rates . compared to the patients with impaired ccc , patients with adequate ccc manifested significantly higher efv levels .
it is possible that similar mechanisms may be attributable for increase in efv level in patients with ccc . finally , one of the most important limitations was the failure to measure some parameters , such as fgf ( fibroblast growth factor ) , vascular endothelial growth factor , no , tnf- that could be helpful in evaluating the relationship between efv and impaired ccc in detail . in conclusion ,
