the results indicated that computational approaches could be used to design a stimulus protocol that increases long - term synaptic plasticity , transcriptional activation , and long - term sensitization .
the present results indicated the feasibility of using computational methods to assist in the design of training procedures that enhance learning
the present results suggested that modeling the dynamics of biochemical cascades could play an essential role in understanding why specific training protocols are more effective than others , and thereby , help guide the development of better learning paradigms .
for example , a form of training with expanding isis appears to lead to enhanced performance in verbal recall tasks .
in the present study , a simplified mathematical model of the dynamic activation of pka and erk was developed ( fig .
interestingly , the non - uniform distribution of isis in the enhanced protocol was in marked contrast to the fixed intervals used in previous protocols for behavioral training in aplysia .
a goal of the present study was to develop training protocols that enhanced learning and memory . however , the model described in fig .
the mechanistic underpinnings of this form of training are not well understood , and therefore provide little guidance for designing protocols that maximize retention .
