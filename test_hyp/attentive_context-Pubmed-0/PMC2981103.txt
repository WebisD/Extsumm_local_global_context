in summary , ad is increasingly being diagnosed as one of the most important medical problems in the elderly , and the management of elderly patients with ad is complex .
a comprehensive approach is required that focuses on both the patient and caregiver . despite all developments ,
this view is supported in large part by clinical and pathologic similarities to early - onset , dominantly inherited familial ad , where genetic mutations related to amyloids have been identified .
our treatment options for prevention and treatment of the cognitive , behavioral , and psychologic symptoms of ad are still lacking .
age is the most important risk factor for ad , with the prevalence rising substantially between the ages of 65 and 85 years.1 the incidence of the disease doubles every five years after 65 years of age , with diagnosis of 1275 new cases per year per 100,000 persons older than 65 years , so that ad affects 30%50% of all people by the age of 85 years.2 data on centenarians show that ad is not necessarily the outcome of aging , but the odds of receiving a diagnosis of ad after 85 years exceed one in three.3,4 despite its remarkable prevalence among the elderly , ad has been regarded as a specific disease , distinct from normal aging .
