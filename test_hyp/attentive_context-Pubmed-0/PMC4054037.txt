hence the findings may be used as a lead to further studies on hms to clinically describe and classify the occurrence of the symptoms in combination with genetic status of ctsc gene into mild , moderate and severe forms of hms .
taken together , the findings of the present study provides clinically significant data as the ile453val mutation in exon 7 , rs3888798 in intron 2 and a novel snp in intron 5 have been observed in a compound manner in ctsc gene for the first time in a hms subject .
more recently pls has been reported in subjects born to non - consanguineous parents as well . in the present study , we have investigated the genetic status of ctsc gene in a patient with clinical symptoms of hms to : ( 1 ) confirm that the subject indeed had a mutation in ctsc gene , which is indicative of hms and ( 2 ) to find out the mutant region with the ctsc gene in the subject , especially since neither the subject nor her parents were from the cochin jewish background , but belonged to the south indian dravidian race .
hain - munk syndrome ( hms ) ( omim # 245010 ) is an extremely rare form of autosomal recessive disorder , which along with papillon - leferve syndrome ( pls ) ( omim # 245,000 ) is classified as type iv palmoplantar keratoderma ( ppk ) .
