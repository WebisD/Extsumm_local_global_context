, we report on a neonate who presented with massive hepatomegaly and increased nse levels and was misdiagnosed with congenital neuroblastoma .
acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( amkl ) with t(1;22)(p13;q13 ) represents < 1% of all acute myeloid leukemias ( aml ) , and is associated with the rbm15 ( ott)-mkl1 ( mal ) fusion gene .
an infant with amkl and a complex translocation demonstrated only 520% blasts on the initial bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy .
therefore , myelodysplastic syndrome was initially diagnosed ; however , only later did blasts become apparent in the peripheral blood 15 . in the present case , amkl might have occurred in the fetal period because hematopoietic cells are mainly produced in the fetal liver . here , we report on a neonate who presented with massive hepatomegaly , increased serum nse levels , and was misdiagnosed with congenital neuroblastoma .
a case of congenital anerythremic erythroleukemia was reported to present with hepatic failure and have a fetal outcome of multivisceral involvement 14 .
amkl with t(1;22)(p13;q13 ) is a rare disease that is often associated with massive organomegaly .
neuron - specific enolase ( nse ) , the -subunit of enolase , is found not only in neuroendocrine cells but also in other cells including erythrocytes and subsets of lymphocytes 4,5 . increased levels of serum nse
