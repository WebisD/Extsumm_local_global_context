with intensification of glycemic control , accord demonstrates a 22% increase in sudden deaths associated with ad .
( + ) beta - blocker ,  are those patients who were beta - blocker nave at the beginning of the study and were started on beta - blocker during the study .
the p&s method results are consistent with the hemodynamic results and with the expected autonomic effects of changes in beta - blocker therapy known to underlie the hemodynamic responses ( 13 ) .
our hypotheses are that the beta - blocker , metoprolol , would inhibit sympathetic tone less than the combination alpha- and beta - blocker , carvedilol .
( )beta - blocker ,  consists of patients who started the study period on beta - blocker and had beta - blocker discontinued during the study
establishing and maintaining normal parasympathetic and sympathetic balance may reduce morbidity risk and minimize mortality risk .
3b , middle ; p<0.010 ) in response to carvedilol , and increases in response to metoprolol .
more specifically however , our study shows that carvedilol , which is both an alpha- and beta - adrenergic blocker , demonstrates a greater response than metoprolol , which is a pure beta - blocker , and demonstrates clear differences on the effects on sympathovagal balance ( sb ) .
