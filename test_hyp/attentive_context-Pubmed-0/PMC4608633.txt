, our clinic has experienced 64 cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction , all of which were successfully treated with lacrimal passage irrigation . in this procedure
we have never observed any other cases in which a lump of foodstuff was retained in the nasolacrimal duct and caused an obstruction , as in the present patient . in other cases ,
of the 64 cases , recurrence only occurred in the 1 case that we present here . in this patient ,
this is not a frequent cause of nasolacrimal obstruction , but it should perhaps be considered as a possible factor in similar cases of refractory nasolacrimal disorders .
the patient , a 39-year - old male who works as a surgeon and is the lead author of this report , experienced abnormal lacrimation of the left eye while at work .
the blockage resulted from rice grains ingested over a period of many years , forming an obstructive mass .
the patient reported here first presented with persistent lacrimation . only after repeated unsuccessful treatments was it determined to be due to obstruction by impacted foodstuffs .
, 0.4% xylocaine ophthalmic solution is injected using a 1-ml syringe tube and a lacrimal passage irrigation needle , with the tip of the needle being inserted into the inferior lacrimal punctum pointing toward the nose and facing slightly downward . to facilitate irrigation ,
