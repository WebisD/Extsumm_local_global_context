one of the pattern of splenic activity that help to detect splenic involvement on pet / ct is diffusely increased f - fdg uptake greater than that in the liver and bone marrow with or without corresponding ct lesions . in this context , we report a case of a patient with hodgkin 's lymphoma in remission presenting with f - fdg avid splenomegaly .
flurodeoxyglucose ( f - fdg ) positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) has become the imaging modality of choice for initial staging , follow - up and treatment response assessment in patients with hodgkin 's lymphoma and has proved superior to contrast enhanced ct ( cect ) in these settings .
the present case report is about a 22-year - old male patient who presented with enlarged right cervical lymph node .
f - fdg pet / ct has accuracy of almost 100% in diagnosing primary splenic involvement during initial staging of lymphoma . however , in the post - therapy setting its role for evaluation of secondary splenic involvement is limited .
pet / ct is a useful modality for staging and restaging of hodgkin 's lymphoma with high sensitivity and specificity .
