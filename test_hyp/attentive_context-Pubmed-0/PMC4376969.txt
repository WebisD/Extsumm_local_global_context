, the main mpv value of 40 patients with brucellosis was 7.58  1.96 fl in the beginning of the treatment and 7.90  1.96 fl at the end .
the current study aimed to investigate the mpv , rdw , and crp values as inflammatory markers of the disease ( 8) .
examined the mpv values of 39 patients and found the values of 7.84  1.15 fl in the acute phase and 7.83  0.9 fl in the post - treatment phase ( 1 ) . while these values were within the normal range of mpv
the mean leukocyte count was 7.3  2.9 and 7.4  2.0 (  10/mm ) in the ab and the control groups , respectively .
when the leukocyte counts in the acute phase and in the first - year follow - up were compared , no difference was observed and the counts were similar to those of the control group ( p > 0.05 ) .
the crp level in the ab group was significantly higher compared with that of the control group ( p < 0.05 ) . in the follow - up year , the crp values remained in the normal range : 5.44  8.91 mg / dl ( p > 0.05 ) .
