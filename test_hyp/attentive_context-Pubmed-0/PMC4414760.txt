several studies have reported cases of long - term survival with treatment consisting of only local surgical excision,6,7 and there have been other cases removed by endoscopic mucosal resection ( emr ) alone in japan.8 here , we present a case of arm treated with emr with adjuvant interferon therapy .
a 77-year - old man was admitted to our emergency department with anal bleeding . he had a 4-month history of anal bleeding and recent aggravation .
nevertheless , if there is a shallow depth of invasion and the general condition of the patient is not good enough to justify surgery , less invasive surgical methods such as emr with or without adjuvant therapy may be performed .
the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of arm is yet to be established .
however , because the resection margin was positive and the depth of tumor invasion was not clear in the initial polypectomy , we needed adjuvant interferon therapy after polypectomy and emr . in conclusion , arm has a poor prognosis and needs surgical treatment .
it represents less than 1% of all melanomas and accounts for less than 4% of anal malignancies.1 arm is documented as the third most common location of melanoma , after cutaneous and ocular .
