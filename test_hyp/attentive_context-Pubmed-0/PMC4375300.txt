the oral glucose challenge screening gct test appears to be a sensitive instrument for the detection of glucose metabolism disorders in pd patients with normal fasting glucose .
in the current study , we aimed to evaluate the applicability of the 50-g gct for the detection of gmd in non - diabetic continuous ambulatory pd patients with normal fasting glucose levels .
considering the mentioned similarities , we aimed to examine the utility of the oral glucose tolerance screening test ( 50-g gct ) for pd patients , which is used in a two - step approach to evaluate gestational diabetes . the first step 
the test was applied exclusively to detect insulin resistance , and the data on increased glycemic and insulinemic responses were presented . more informative and extensive
igt persisted in eight patients ( 40  % ) , and of particular note , ifg ( 100125  mg / dl ) occurred in four patients ( 20  % ) despite 50-g gct being in the normal range .
the patients were prospectively observed , and after a median time of 25.8  months , the glucose metabolism evaluation was repeated . during the second 50-g gct ,
