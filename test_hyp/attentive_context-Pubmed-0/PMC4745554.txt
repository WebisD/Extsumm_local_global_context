hence , the aim of this study was to determine the effect of additives , that is , acacia gum , nacl , and sucrose on the physical properties such as water absorption ( wa ) , water absorption index ( wai ) , and water solubility index ( wsi ) of lotus stem starch ( lss ) employing response surface methodology ( rsm ) .
in the presence of acacia gum , nacl , and sucrose , the physical properties of lotus stem starch might be governed by hydrocolloid - salt , hydrocolloid - sugar interaction and individual effect of these additives . desired or optimum level of these additives was obtained by using rsm , which returned 1.5% of acacia gum , 0.5% of nacl , and 30% of sucrose with a desirability of 0.844 .
wa , wai , and wsi are 65.42% , 14.95 , and 2.74% , respectively . in presence of acacia gum , swelling power of starch increased .
sucrose also retarded amylose leaching ( wsi ) by mechanism of building bridges with starch chains and reducing their flexibility .
hence , results of present investigation suggest important practical inferences in applications of assayed additives in starch - based food products containing lotus stem starch as one of the major ingredients which is highly popular as functional food in east asian part of the world .
