, it has been shown that hyphomycetous entomopathogenic fungi can induce the production of teleomorphic states of cordyceps under the suitable nutritional and environmental conditions .
it is quite difficult to study also mating system of rare cordyceps species , such as c. bassiana . from the present study
single conidial isolates of b. bassiana efcc 13188 were similar to c. bassiana efcc 12511 isolates   with regard to colony pigmentation and texture .
4 ) . all of the eight single conidial isolates of b. bassiana efcc 13188 and four single ascospore isolates of c. bassiana efcc 12511a  b   were inoculated in brown rice medium in all possible combinations of two isolates at a time to observe the nature of fruiting bodies ( table 2 ) .
mating types of both b. bassiana efcc 13188 and c. bassiana efcc 12511a  b isolates could not be verified from out - crossings .
all of the eight single conidial isolates of b. bassiana efcc 13188 and four single ascospore isolates of c. bassiana efcc 12511a  b   were inoculated in brown rice medium in all possible combinations of two isolates at a time to observe the nature of fruiting bodies ( table 2 ) .
