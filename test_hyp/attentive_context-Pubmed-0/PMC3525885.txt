therapy for actinic keratosis should be a carefully chosen compromise between undesired side - effects and therapeutic efficacy and needs to be based on a consideration of all of the relevant clinical studies .
the most recent of these is the study by dirschka and colleagues   which appeared recently in the british journal of dermatology and in which a gel formulation of 5-aminolaevulinic acid ( bf-200 ala ) was found to be superior to methyl-5-aminolaevulinate ( mal ) . in the same study ,
, it would appear that the last word concerning the optimal photosensitizer and radiation source for the treatment of actinic keratosis has not yet been spoken .
an important study in this context is the study by von felbert and colleagues   with a longer follow - up time of 12 months ( compared to 12 weeks in the study of dirschka et al . ) and in which the use of narrow - band and broad - band sources were found to be equally effective .
the problem of such a bias has recently been outlined , together with the need for an up - to - date selection of literature and the recommendation that a concealment of contradictory or critical literature should be avoided .
