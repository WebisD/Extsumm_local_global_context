we aimed to compare the international association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups ( iadpsg ) and the world health organization ( who ) criteria to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) in chennai , india .
we reviewed the retrospective data of 1351 pregnant women who underwent screening for gdm at four selected diabetes centers at chennai ( three private and one government ) .
the who 2-h criteria of > 140 mg / dl alone appears to be sufficient to diagnose gdm , as it picks up the majority of gdm cases diagnosed by both the whole who criteria as well as the same number of cases as the three sample iadpsg criteria .
it appears an anomaly that in the who criteria , the fasting cut - off had been set at 126 mg / dl which is diagnostic of diabetes in non - pregnant adults , whereas the 2-h cut - off was set at 140 mg / dl , which is the diagnostic cut - point for igt in non - pregnant adults . probably because of this inherent contradiction in the diagnostic criteria , the fasting values in the who criteria are not particularly useful to diagnose gdm and
