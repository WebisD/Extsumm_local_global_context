control of cchf requires control of the disease vector , and surveillance is necessary to ensure optimum timing of interventions such as livestock dipping or sponging because tick abundance is highly seasonal . further research on rates of antibody acquisition among humans and animals , virus transmission dynamics , and effectiveness of disease control measures is required .
self reported clinical illness ( fever ) occurred in 55% of participants over a 5-month reporting period . among the participants
seroprevalence in this population of animal owners is higher than in other reported studies from the region ( 3,4 ) , and the risk for exposure appears approximately uniform .
we used an in - house elisa using the ibar 10200 strain of cchf as antigen ( us army medical research institute for infectious diseases ) and anti - species igg horseradish peroxidase  conjugated ( kpl inc . ,
the primary outcome was seropositivity among household members , with secondary outcomes being seropositivity in animals and the presence of virus in ticks .
prevalence was uniformly high regardless of age , sex , or origin of the animals , suggesting that the disease is highly endemic in the livestock population . among our sample ,
