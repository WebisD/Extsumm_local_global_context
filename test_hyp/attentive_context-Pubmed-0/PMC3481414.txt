pediatric cases have also been reported.  herein , we present a 48-year - old female patient who developed a lgfs on the lower leg .
lgfs is a very rare and distinctive type of fibrosarcoma that was first described by evans in 1987 .
the clinical presentation , histopathology , surgical treatment , and follow - up are discussed .
we used a combination of mesh graft transplantation and vacuum - assisted closure to cover the large defect .
a 48-year - old woman was referred to our department because she had developed a slow - growing plaque below the left knee for 2 years .
it has been demonstrated recently that such a combination , with microporous sponge for vacuum - assisted closure , results in a significantly improved take rate .
sarcomas are mesenchymal neoplasms with various lines of differentiation , i.e. , fibrocytic , myogenic , neurogenic , vascular , chondro - osseus , or undefined .
lgfs prefers subfascial soft tissue layers on the trunk and proximal extremities in younger adults but can also develop in internal organs .
it is a spindle - cell tumor composed of collagen - rich and myxoid parts .
the defect was covered by a mesh graft transplant covered by vacuum - assisted closure ( vac ; kci international ) [ figure 3 ] .
