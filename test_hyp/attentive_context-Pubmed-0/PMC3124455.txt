to demonstrate the usefulness of enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography ( edi - oct ) in investigating choroidal lesions inaccessible to ultrasound sonography .
in a 60-year - old woman with an asymptomatic choroidal nevus , normal oct was used to observe the macula and edi - oct to image the choroidal nevus that was inaccessible to ultrasound .
edi - oct appears to be an excellent technique for measuring choroidal nevi and all choroidal lesions accessible to oct imaging by depicting their exact location in the choroid , their dimensions , and their demarcation from the surrounding healthy tissue , thus allowing for a more efficient and accurate follow - up .
we observed a thickened choroid delineated by the shadow cone behind it , measuring 1,376  325 m in the larger vertical cut and 1,220  325 m in the larger horizontal cut in an image with a 1:1 pixel mapping and automatic zoom .
the lesion was located in the superior macula , and the nevus was homogeneous in its reflectivity .
we believe that this technique is clinically useful and , together with color fundus photography , can provide a more efficient and accurate follow - up of choroidal nevi .
