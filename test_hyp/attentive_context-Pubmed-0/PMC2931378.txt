adaptive radiotherapy ,  and will be the focus of this paper . in this examination of adaptive radiation in the setting of lung cancer , we will assess the impact of this development in sbrt , conventionally fractionated imrt , and proton therapy .  
we will then focus on interfraction changes that occur during the length of treatment ( over a period of several weeks ) , such as changes in tumor mobility , tumor volume , anatomy , and body weight , and examine specific studies that assess the impact of adaptive planning on improving dose distributions in these setting .  
finally , we will appraise future directions of adaptive radiation , including selective dose escalation through the visualization of nonresponsive regions and internal tracking to monitor intrafraction motion in real - time , both of which may be able to allow for further sparing of critical structures while maintaining accurate delivery for treatment of this aggressive disease .
we will first define key terms in adaptive radiation , and will then review prior studies assessing the magnitude of intrafractional changes , which we define as changes within a given fraction of radiation , from setup to delivery .
