a total of 110 cases were studied , which were distributed among 30 cases of breast ( 10 fibroadenoma , four mastitis and 12 ductal carcinoma ) , 40 cases of lymph node ( 20 reactive hyperplasia , 12 granulomatous lymphadenitis , three lymphoma and five metastatic carcinoma ) , 10 cases of salivary gland ( two sialadenitis , five mixed tumor , one warthin 's tumor and two mucoepidermoid carcinoma ) , 18 cases of thyroid ( 10 colloid goiter , four thyroiditis and four carcinoma cases ) and 12 cases of soft tissue and bone lesions ( five benign and seven malignant ) .
wilcoxon signed rank test statistics of lbc versus cp for breast cases , fibroadenoma , mastitis and ductal carcinoma were better diagnosed on lbc preparations due to clarity of the nuclear features [ figure 1 ] .
comparison between cytological features in lbc and cs was carried out using the wilcoxon signed rank test separately for each organ in a tabular form , as shown in table 2 . in our study , in two cases of pleomorphic adenoma , one case of warthin 's tumor and two cases of colloid goiter , a support of cs was needed due to pitfalls in lbc described above .
