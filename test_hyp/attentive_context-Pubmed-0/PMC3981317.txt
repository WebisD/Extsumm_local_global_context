the results of this study indicate that a high proportion of community - acquired isolations of escherichia coli are resistant to multiple antibiotics and having g3crec isolation is associated with higher risk of death in this indian setting .
the aim of this study is to describe the prevalence of g3crec and to investigate the effect of g3crec on the mortality of patients admitted to a district hospital in a rural area of india .
21-day mortality was 5% ( 95% ci , 1.416.5 ) in patients with cephalosporin susceptible escherichia coli and 15.6% ( 95% ci , 10.722.1 ) in patients with g3crec . among the 154 patients with g3crec , 126 ( 81.8% , 95% ci 75 87.1 ) had an esbl producing escherichia coli .
the proportion of patients with g3crec was 79.4% ( 95% ci , 73.184.4 ) and the global 21-day mortality was 13.4% ( 95% ci , 9.318.9 ) .
the results of this study show the high proportion of resistance to quinolones , penicillins and cephalosporins in strains of escherichia coli isolated from the community .
