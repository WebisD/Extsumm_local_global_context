the iom report called for additional research to clarify the relation of vitamin d levels with nonskeletal outcomes ( 1,22 )
several studies presented rrs for 25(oh)d levels and type 2 diabetes with and without adjustment for metabolic variables , including bmi , hypertension , markers of glycemia and insulin sensitivity , plasma lipid levels , or inflammatory markers . the associations between 25(oh)d levels and diabetes risk were attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for bmi and hypertension and/or other biomarkers : the rrs were 0.52 ( 95% ci 0.460.58 ) and 0.63 ( 0.560.72 ) in the models without and with adjustment for these covariates , respectively ( p for interaction = 0.02 ) . likewise ,
blood 25(oh)d levels , which reflect all sources of vitamin d exposure and have a half - life of 2 to 3 weeks , have been widely used as a surrogate of vitamin d status ( 2,3 ) . due to differences in assay methods and population characteristics ,
on the basis of 21 prospective studies including 4,996 incident cases of type 2 diabetes and 76,220 nondiabetic controls , our meta - analysis showed a significantly inverse association between 25(oh)d levels and incidence of type 2 diabetes .
