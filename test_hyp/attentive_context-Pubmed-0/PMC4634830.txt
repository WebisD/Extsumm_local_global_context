the osteopathic approach to the fascial system of the peripheral nerve does not have a grounding in scientific research , being based only on the clinical experience of individual operators , despite the use of peripheral nerve palpation as a method for the evaluation and testing of the nerve s function .
it is only recently that fascial osteopathy research has been aimed at understanding what happens to the fascia following treatment and , as a result of the first studies , it has been possible to highlight some of the benefits , including a reduction in local pain and inflammation .
the nerves and their structures change and are subject to the law of neuroplasticity : they adapt to reflect the stimulus which is present ( mechanical , biochemical , electrical , or metabolic).1 the peripheral nervous system is subjected to a daily mechanical tensile load , as when a joint moves , undergoing compression and stretching .
the authors wish to encourage the initiation of new research in the fields of academic and clinical osteopathy that is aimed at quantifying the possible benefits a patient may derive from osteopathic treatment of the peripheral nerve .
such therapy is used by manual operators with the intent of allowing adequate sliding of the peripheral nerve and surrounding tissue , using two methods in particular : the sliding technique or a technique that alters the tension of the nerve path.13 studies on the human model are scarce , and there are no precise data on the method of movement that should be performed on a patient s nerve path in order to optimize the results .
