our data have allowed us to identify a new early predictor of subclinical organ damage and emphasize the importance of performing an ogtt in all subjects affected by essential hypertension , paying attention not only to 2- h but also to 1-h postload plasma glucose values , which are more strongly associated with diastolic dysfunction , in order to better stratify the global cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients .
the most clinically relevant information from this study , is that there is a statistically significant and direct correlation between 1-h postload plasma glucose and diastolic dysfunction in ngt hypertensive patients .
( 25 ) showing that postprandial hyperglycemia induces myocardial perfusion defects in t2d patients , secondary to deterioration in microvascular function causing a decrease in myocardial blood flow .
from the first to the fourth group , there was a significant increase of triglyceride ( p = 0.002 ) and a significant reduction of hdl cholesterol ( p = 0.034 ) . obviously , a progressive increase of fasting and 1-h and 2-h postload glucose parallels the worsening of glucose tolerance ( p < 0.0001 ) .
this result persists after adjustment for all significant covariates reported in table 3 . of interest and clinically relevant , ngt 155 subjects had significantly worse diastolic function compared with ngt<155 subjects and similar compared with igt and t2d patients . to our knowledge , this is the first study that demonstrates this association , confirming the usefulness of early diagnosis in the stratification of overall cardiovascular risk ; in addition , it highlights the links between early alterations of glucose tolerance and early alterations in cardiac function .
