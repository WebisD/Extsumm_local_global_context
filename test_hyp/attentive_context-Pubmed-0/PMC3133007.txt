another advantage is that the procedure can be reversed without changing eyelid anatomy.5,6 several recent modifications to the implant as well as the surgical technique have been reported to minimize complications.710 in this study , we evaluated the different ocular results and complications , as well as esthetic satisfaction , in patients who underwent gold weight implantation 2 mm or 5 mm from the lid margin .
this study reports that a higher level of insertion of the gold plate achieves better esthetic results with less noticeable bulge in the upper eyelid and with acceptable functional results .
placement of gold plates at a higher level could avoid some of the drawbacks of lower - level plate placement , including upper eyelid bulge and ptosis , especially given that there is thinning of the eyelids and orbicularis muscle in facial palsy .
sixty - one eyes of 60 patients ( 32 male and 28 female ) were enrolled in this study .
three patients had overcorrection ( defined as ptosis > 2 mm ) after gold plate insertion using the first technique and only one using the second technique .
there were no significant differences in any of the parameters evaluated between the first and the second techniques , and the degree of improvement in eyelid closure , keratopathy , and visual acuity was the same .
