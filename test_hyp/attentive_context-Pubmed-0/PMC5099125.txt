combination of sandblasting and acid etching produced the highest sbs value in zirconia and lithium disilicate .
ninety - six disc specimens measured 14  4  0.2 mm were prepared from three different type of coping materials ( n = 32 ) : i ) metal alloy ( ma ) , ii ) zirconia oxide ( zo ) , and iii ) lithium disilicate ( ld )
furthermore , there was a statistically significant interaction between the effect of coping materials and pre - surface treatments on shear bond strength , as shown by non - parallel lines within the graph ( p < .05 ) ( fig .
zirconia had the highest shear bond strength value , while lithium disilicate had the lowest shear bond strength value among the coping materials tested .
therefore , the purpose of this study is to investigate shear bond strength ( sbs ) of veneering ceramic to different types of coping material ( metal alloy , zirconia oxide , and lithium disilicate ) after various pre - surface treatments such as sandblast and acid etch .
tukey 's multiple comparisons showed a statistically significant difference in sbs of veneering ceramic within the coping material groups and the pre - surface treatment groups as shown in table 3 and table 4 ( p < .05 ) . among various types of coping materials tested , group zo produced significantly higher sbs than group ma , while group ma produced significantly higher sbs than group ld . on the other hand ,
