in a recent issue of critical care , we presented a series of 13 patients undergoing post - cardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) with bivalirudin - based anticoagulation .
after this series , we satisfactorily continued this experience , reaching about 20 patients treated .
this is particularly true in the case of a very large right or left atrium with insufficient venous drainage or the case of very poor ventricular systolic function with intraventricular blood stagnation . to avoid this condition
however , we think that a word of caution should be added to our recently published experience . owing to its pharmacological profile
, bivalirudin is rapidly cleaved by proteolytic enzymes , and its half - life is about 25 minutes when the renal function is normal .
intracardiac thrombus formation during ecmo with heparin anticoagulation has been described as well , but the pharmacokinetic properties of heparin may limit the risk of thrombus formation due to blood stagnation .
the use of bivalirudin for cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb )   and ecmo   is a feasible option .
we think that , in the event of echocardiographic evidence of a ' smoke effect ' within one or more cardiac chambers , bivalirudin should be replaced by standard heparin anticoagulation .
