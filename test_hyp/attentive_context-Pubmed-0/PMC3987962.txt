due to the important role of hla - g in the regulation of the immune response and its relevant function during the course of pregnancy , the overall structure of the molecule has been maintained during the evolution process , preserving major hla - g binding sites to leukocyte receptors and hla - g dimer formation . on the other hand , several variable sites
in contrast , most of the variable sites found in the hla - g 3utr might influence hla - g expression by facilitating or hindering microrna binding and/or influencing mrna stability .
firstly , we will review the structure of the hla - g promoter region and its implication in transcriptional gene control ; secondly , the structure of the hla - g 3utr and the major actors of the posttranscriptional gene control ; and , finally , the presence of elements in the coding region that may regulate gene expression and differential mrna splicing .
the nonclassical hla - g molecule presents several properties that differ from other classical class i hla ( -a , -b , and -c ) molecules , including restricted tissue distribution ; limited protein variability ; presence of several membrane - bound and soluble isoforms ; unique molecular structure , presenting a particular peptide - binding groove that impairs peptide presentation to t cells ; ability to form dimers and polymers and a reduced cytoplasmic tail that impairs molecule turnover ; and , most importantly , the molecule that modulates several functions of immune system cells ( reviewed by ) .
