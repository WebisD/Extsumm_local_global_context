a 70-year - old man was admitted to the emergency department with a 1-month history of coughing and dyspnea .
the discoveries serve as evidence that this case involved a congenital disorder . in conclusion , we believe that the cause of the intercostal hernia combined with the morgagni 's hernia might have been due to incomplete development of the chest wall and diaphragm . the increased abdominal pressure due to recurrent cough is what aggravated the symptoms .
most congenital lung hernias are found in the supraclavicular area , whereas a lung herniation in the intercostal area is rare .
a lung herniation is defined as a protrusion of the lung beyond the normal confines of the thoracic cavity through an abnormal opening in the chest wall . a condition associated with increased intra - thoracic pressure or that weakens
, lung herniation is such a rare disease , that only about 300 patients have been reported with the disease in the world literature , and most were single case reports .
we located the agenesis of the intercostal muscle and the costal cartilage , and the congenital morgagni 's hernia was located near the intercostal herniation .
congenital lung hernias are especially rare and consist of approximately 18% of all reported lung hernias .
