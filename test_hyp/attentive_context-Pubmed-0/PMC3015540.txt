further accrual of patients and careful follow - up is needed to better understand the problem of ventral hernias and their repair with mesh .
our early results indicate that laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia repair with pp mesh and omental coverage is not associated with sonographically detectable visceral adhesions in most patients . moreover , visceral complications such as bowel obstruction or enterocutaneous fistula do not occur .
between 1999 and 2001 , patients undergoing laparoscopic vih repair were prospectively enrolled in a surgical database . in 30 patients , pp mesh ( prolene , ethicon corporation , somerville , nj )
nevertheless , long - term complications , such as severe adhesions , obstruction , and fistula formation , have been reported with pp . , these complications seem to occur when the pp mesh is placed in direct contact with the serosal surface of the bowel . however , if omentum is interposed between the mesh and viscera , adhesions should not involve loops of bowel and should be restricted to omentum only . using this technique , franklin
because the prosthetic mesh is placed intraabdominally , many surgeons use expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ( eptfe ) grafts because of the low adhesive potential . , , high cost , inferior handling characteristics , and poor incorporation into the tissues are among the drawbacks of eptfe mesh . another product , polypropylene ( pp )
