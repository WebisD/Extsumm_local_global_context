we will demonstrate that chromium(iii)-doped yttrium aluminum borate ( yab ) fulfills all these requirements and is , therefore , a thermographic phosphor of choice for sensing and imaging at ambient temperatures .
an  ideal  luminescent material for sensing temperature should fulfill the following requirements : ( i ) have high brightness ; ( ii ) possess excitation in the visible or nir part of the spectrum to minimize autofluorescence interferences ; ( iii ) have high - temperature sensitivity in the desired range ; ( iv ) be photostable ; ( v ) have negligible cross - sensitivity to other analytes such as , e.g. oxygen ; and ( vi ) be commercially available or simple to manufacture .
potential applications include sensing and imaging of temperature in those fields where invasiveness is undesirable and combination of the phosphor with other indicators in temperature - compensated optical chemosensors and pressure - sensitive paints .
compared to luminescent metalligand complexes , cr(iii)-doped yab additionally benefits from chemical and photochemical inertness and the absence of the cross - sensitivity to oxygen .
very often relatively long luminescence decay times ( > 1 s ) are desirable in order to enable lifetime interrogation . in this contribution
