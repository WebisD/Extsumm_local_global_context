weekly paclitaxel treatment has an efficacy comparable to that of the every-3-weekly paclitaxel but with less myelosuppression and neurotoxicity . based on these studies , we selected a combination of weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m ) and gemcitabine ( 1,000 mg / m ) and conducted a phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with sclc who have relapsed or failed to respond to first - line platinum - based therapy .
our study suggests that paclitaxel and gemcitabine can be good options for second - line therapy in platinum - resistant sclc patients .
in conclusion , second - line paclitaxel and gemcitabine were well - tolerated with a 30.3% response rate in sclc patients previously treated with platinum - based chemotherapy .
the median ttp was 12.0 weeks ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 7.57 to 16.44 ) , the median os was 31.0 weeks ( 95% ci , 23.44 to 38.56 ) , and the 1-year os rate was 30.3% ( 95% ci , 14.6 to 46.0 ) ( fig .
also , high activity in patients with refractory disease may reflect a lack of adverse effects of prior treatment with irinotecan / platinum on the antitumor activity of paclitaxel / gemcitabine , which suggests a lack of cross - resistance between paclitaxel / gemcitabine and irinotecan / platinum . a recent randomized phase 3 trial of amrubicin versus topotecan as second - line treatment   reported a median os of 7.5 months with amrubicin versus 7.8 months with topotecan ; in refractory patients , median os was 6.2 and 5.7 months , respectively .
