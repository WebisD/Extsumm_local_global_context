secondly , we compared corticosterone 
 levels between plasma and saliva in response to restraint stress , and finally , we 
 investigated the adequate recovery , at set intervals after anesthesia , for saliva collection 
 between pre - stress and post - stress in mice .
whether the salivary corticosterone is available to evaluate stress 
 response in mice , first we confirmed the transfer of glucocorticoid from the blood to the 
 saliva after administration of exogenous cortisol .
in this paper , cortisol was detected in both the plasma and saliva as a result of the ip 
 administration of cortisol . on the other hand ,
2 ) , and our observations agreed with previous studies , reporting plasma 
 corticosterone levels in mice and rats treated with restraint stress   . in humans ,
. moreover , to evaluate restraint stress by the corticosterone level in saliva collected 
 from mice under anesthesia , an adequate recovery period of one week is preferable .
our proposal techniques in the present study , using 
 saliva sampling to measure levels of corticosterone in it , would make it possible to 
 compliment refinement in addition to reduction practices , since the saliva collection is low 
 invasive technique and is performed under anesthetized condition . in conclusion , we suggest that salivary corticosterone levels reflect plasma corticosterone 
 levels , and thus , it will be a useful and less - invasive biomarker of physical stress in 
 mice
