these observations prompted us now to assess the association between celiac disease and severe chronic depression and schizophrenia .
, 200 inpatient men comprising 100 with chronic depression and 100 with schizophrenia ( mean age 37 years , range 18 - 68 years ) were enrolled in razi hospital , tabriz , iran .
the prevalence of positive celiac disease serology in patients with chronic psychiatric disorders was thus slightly but not significantly higher than in controls ; 1.5% , ( 95% ci : 0.38 - 4.03 ) and 0.5% ( 95% ci : 0.00025 - 2.44 ) , respectively ( p = 0.06 ) . clinical features and laboratory findings among the patients with schizophrenia and depression are shown in table 1 .
there may thus be additional celiac case in our study group , but we consider that this would not change our conclusions . to conclude , mass screening for celiac disease in patients with depression or schizophrenia is not advocated . despite this , alertness to celiac disease should be high , since early diagnosis and treatment by gluten - free diet may ameliorate the symptoms and quality of life of these patients .
the same authors have reported that in adolescent celiac disease patients the frequency of depression and disruptive behavioral disorders was higher than in controls , 31% and 7% , respectively ( 6 ) .
