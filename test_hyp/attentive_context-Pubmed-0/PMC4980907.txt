hashimoto 's encephalopathy , a rare disorder , is unrelated to the thyroid status of a patient .
we report the first case of atypical presentation of hashimoto 's encephalopathy in an adolescent who recovered successfully with nonsteroid agents and levothyroxine .
although hashimoto 's encephalopathy is rare among the pediatric group , it is a diagnostic challenge in child psychiatry and neurology .
managing the symptoms of this condition is often difficult because of the unpredictable nature of hashimoto 's thyroiditis . in a recent review ,
a minor change in the thyroid hormone concentration has been reported with changes in cognitive and affective functions .
a psychiatrist should be aware of this often unrecognized entity to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment , particularly among the pediatric group .
although it is a controversial disorder , hashimoto 's encephalopathy is considered an autoimmune disease because of its association with immunological disorders , such as myasthenia gravis , primary biliary cirrhosis , and pernicious anemia .
most patients present with variable neuropsychiatric manifestations and course , indicating pathogenesis through both autoimmune and vasculitis mechanisms .
hashimoto 's encephalopathy , an unusual neurological disorder with female preponderance , has its typical onset in the fifth decade of unclear etiology , pathogenesis , and management .
