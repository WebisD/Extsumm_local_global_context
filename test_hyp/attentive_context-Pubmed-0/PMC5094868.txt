further studies are needed in order to test the utility of these cut - off points in samples of patients with respiratory symptoms treated at respiratory outpatient clinics .
only two studies 


  have assessed bronchodilator response using spirometry exclusively in preschool children .   in the present study we sought to determine bronchodilator response cut - off points for fev1 , fev0.75 , fev0.5 , and fef25 - 75% using the 95th percentile of the change in each parameter and
the recommended bronchodilator response cut - off points for percent predicted fev1 , fev0.75 , and fev0.5 are  12% ,  8% , and  16% , respectively ; for baseline fev1 , fev0.75 , and fev0.5 , the recommended cut - off points are  13% ,  18% , and  20% , respectively . for percent predicted and baseline fef25 - 75% , the recommended cut - off points are  35% and  61% , respectively . given that fef25 - 75% showed good reproducibility , it might be useful in the evaluation of bronchodilator response .
this is the first study to establish , by means of spirometry , bronchodilator response cut - off points in preschoolers , the cut - off points being expressed as the change in percent predicted fev1 , fev0.75 , fev0.5 , and fef25 - 75% .
