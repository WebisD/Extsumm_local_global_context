our results suggest the possibility for a biopsy - free diagnosis of prostate cancer , with the criterion of a psa level > 100 ng / ml and evidence of advanced disease in imaging studies . we still recommend that any patient who is considered a candidate for surgery or radiation , despite a high psa level , should undergo biopsy . nevertheless , because prostate needle biopsy can be associated with several adverse effects , if elderly patients with poor general medical condition present with an extremely elevated serum psa level , a tissue diagnosis of prostate cancer may not be required for starting androgen deprivation therapy .
we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,150 patients who underwent trus - guided prostate needle biopsy for the evaluation of prostate cancer from january 2000 to december 2010 .
the mean psa level of patients with a negative result was 10.39 ng / ml ( range , 4.12 to 85.5 ng / ml ) . the detection rate was gradually increased as the pre - biopsy psa level increased . for example , only 21.8% of group a ( i.e. , psa 4 to 20 ng / ml ) had prostate cancer , whereas all 65 patients of group f ( psa > 100 ng / ml ) had cancer ( positive predictive value=100.0% ) , as presented in fig .
