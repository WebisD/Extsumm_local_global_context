the changes of inflammation - related protein expressions in gingival epithelia might lead to the differences in the mouse models .
we found no contrary impact could be observed between this periodontal infection and onset and severity of diabetes in both types 1 and 2 diabetic mice .
no statistical difference was found in the serum tnf- levels among diabetic mice in neither the infection nor the shame - infection groups ( p > 0.05 ) . to further illuminate the underlying mechanism of the alveolar bone loss in these mice models
the alveolar bone loss levels positively correlated with the severity of periodontal inflammation . in our study , we could observe that all the diabetes mice exhibited alveolar bone loss and db / db mice exhibited more compared to other diabetes mice in both the infection and shame - infection groups .
prior research has proved that the serum tnf- levels positively correlate with fasting blood glucose level , which can not only destroy pancreatic  cells and reduce the sensitivity of insulin but also active the signaling pathways like jak / stat   . in our study , we observed that the serum tnf- levels of diabetic mice were higher compared to their normal controls , and the diabetic periodontitis mice showed higher serum tnf- levels than those of c57 mice in the infection group .
