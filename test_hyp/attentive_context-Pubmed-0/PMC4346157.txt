we calculated the bias in estimates of screening test utilization associated with several published ehr - based algorithms for identifying screening colonoscopies and propose two simple methods to correct this bias .
ehr - derived measures of screening test use are subject to error due to misclassification of screening and diagnostic tests . the implications of this misclassification for ehr - based screening utilization estimates have not been well explored .
we apply these corrections to obtain adjusted estimates of screening colonoscopy utilization using ehr data from group health , an integrated health care system in washington state .
error in classification of tests as screening when using ehr data to study screening utilization should be accounted for in order to eliminate bias and prevent spurious findings .
electronic health records ( ehrs ) are increasingly used by medical providers and offer a wide - reaching source of information on utilization of preventive services .
the bias in screening colonoscopy utilization estimates ranged from an underestimation of 3 percentage points to an overestimation of 12 percentage points across classification methods . if the operating characteristics of the classification method are known or if a statistical model that returns predicted probabilities of screening indication is applied in the population of interest , this information can be used to obtain unbiased estimates through simple corrections to the utilization rates with little loss of precision .
