this study employed the following objectives : ( 1 ) to describe the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to the hospital with hmpv infection , ( 2 ) to determine the frequency of albuterol use in this population , and ( 3 ) to compare clinical outcomes , such as hospital length of stay ( los ) , intensive care unit ( icu ) los , supplemental oxygen use , and mechanical ventilation , between hmpv patients who did and did not receive albuterol .
patients with a previous diagnosis of asthma and those admitted with an asthma - related diagnosis were more likely to receive albuterol ( both p < 0.001 ) .
research involving patients identified to have hmpv infection will be vital and useful in providing a smaller , etiology - specific cohort of patients with clear recommendations for management .
the overwhelmingly high frequency of albuterol administration in patients with hmpv infection , despite a lack of recommendations to support its practice in similar lower respiratory illnesses , is a key finding in this study .
another cochrane review concluded that repeated dosing of racemic epinephrine in hospitalized children with bronchiolitis is also not recommended . while there is an abundance of data regarding the frequency of use and efficacy of beta - adrenergic agents and racemic epinephrine in children with rsv
