the aim of this study , therefore , was to prospectively define the rate of nbi use among patients referred to a large group endoscopy practice for diagnostic endoscopy ( esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy ) , and to identify procedural factors associated with nbi use .
the following data were extracted : procedure type , procedure indication , identification of attending endoscopist , trainee involvement , patient type ( inpatient versus outpatient ) , procedure start time ( a.m. vs. p.m. ) , sedation - type ( endoscopist - directed conscious or deep sedation vs. monitored anesthesia care with anesthesia staff support ) ; performance of endoscopic polypectomy , either by snare or forceps biopsy ; performance of endoscopic tissue biopsy for intent other than polypectomy .
this included use of nbi in 4.7  % ( 5/106 ) of egds and 7.5  % ( 16/212 ) of colonoscopies ( p  =  0.47 for comparison ) .
no difference in rate of nbi use was found when comparing egd with or without biopsy ( 5.5  % [ 3/55 ] vs. 3.9  % [ 2/51 ] ; p  =  1 ) , or when comparing colonoscopy with or without biopsy ( 10.5  % [ 8/76 ] vs. 5.9  % [ 8/136 ] ; p  =  0.28 ) .
