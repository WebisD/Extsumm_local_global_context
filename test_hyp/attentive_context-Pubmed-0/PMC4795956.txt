this marker is made from gold , which makes it biocompatible and ensures it exhibits good contrast on x - ray images . in this study , we describe our initial experience with this new fiducial marker and evaluate the technical feasibility , clinical efficacy , and safety of sbrt using this marker .
the median period between marker implantation and sbrt was 16 days ( range : 031 ) . 

the 18 tumors consisted of 5 hepatocellular carcinomas ( 28% ) and 13 liver metastases ( 72% ) .
