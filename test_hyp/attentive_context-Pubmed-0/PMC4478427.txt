therefore , more detailed studies with respect to the seasonal variations and the effects of abiotic conditions , other than temperature and relative humidity , such as cloud cover , wind velocity and lunar cycle on the nocturnal activity of sand flies may improve knowledge of the behavior of sand flies for important epidemiologically surveys .
when significant effects of traps were established ( p < 0.05 ) , differences among traps were exposed that co2 and standard cdc light traps , shannon trap ( black and white net ) and animal baited trap displayed some similar efficiency , whereas sticky papers and disney trap differed from the others ( p < 0.05 ) .
a significant interaction was revealed between the collection methods and the number of individuals collected using of univariate analysis of variance ( anova ) ( p < 0.05 ) , and there was significant interaction between the trapping methods and the proportion of males and females collected ( p < 0.05 ) .
neither co2 light trap ( 5.0% ) nor cdc light trap ( 3.3% ) and malaise trap ( 0.1% ) showed a high efficiency during the study .
although sand fly abundance was not strongly and significantly influenced by the variations in average monthly temperature and relative humidity during the six months of survey in cukurova plain , south anatolia , turkey , the maximum number of sand flies was recorded in the hottest and driest seasons between june and september when the average temperature was comparatively high , the relative humidity was low and the rainy days ranged between 1.5 to 3.5 days .
