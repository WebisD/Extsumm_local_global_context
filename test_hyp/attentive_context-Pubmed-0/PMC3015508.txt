we describe the case of a 70-year - old male undergoing routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis who developed asystolic cardiac arrest intraoperatively .
a review of the literature revealed 2 cases of asystolic cardiac arrest during laparoscopy : one was during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and one was during diagnostic laparoscopy for gynecologic evaluation .
laparoscopic surgery has established itself as a durable alternative for both gynecologic and general surgical procedures . with increasing popularity and greater utility , the types and number of reported complications are increasing .
a 70-year - old male with a past medical history negative for ischemic heart disease with asymptomatic myocardial infarction was admitted to the hospital with a 24-hour history of severe , acute epigastric abdominal pain .
additionally , no reproducible hemodynamic sequelae occurred during the successful attempt at laparoscopic cholecystectomy , once the temporary pacemaker was in place
asystolic cardiac arrest is a potential manifestation of these hemodynamically significant events . in a review of the literature ,
the american association of gynecology reports an incidence of one in 2500 cases of asystolic arrest during laparoscopy .
this was validated by the fact that recurrent asystole was documented for approximately 5 seconds upon grasping the gallbladder without elevated intraabdominal pressures .
