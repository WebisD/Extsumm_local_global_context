we present a case of persistent severe haematochezia in a patient with ccs , successfully managed with proctocolectomy .
a 50-year - old sri lankan man presented with a 3-month history of diarrhoea , haematochezia and weight loss of 20 kg .
this also highlights the importance of considering cronkhite - canada syndrome as a rare possibility in a middle aged male presenting with haematochezia , specially if the patient is of asian origin and if there are any cutaneous abnormalities suggestive of this condition .
common causes of haematochezia in adults are diverticular disease , vascular ectasia , colitis ( ischaemic , inflammatory or infectious ) , colonic neoplasia and anorectal conditions ( 1 ) .
haematochezia is not reported as a common mode of presentation among patients with cronkhite - canada syndrome ( ccs ) in which diarrhea and dysgeusia are the predominant initial presentations ( 2 ) .
surgery in patients with ccs has been carried out for associated gastrointestinal tract malignancies , intestinal obstruction and severe protein loosing enteropathy ( 3 ) .
thus , a diagnosis of cronkhite - canada syndrome was made , considering the characteristic ectodermal abnormalities on physical examination , endoscopic findings and histology .
