first , to gain some insight into the physicochemical properties of the 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives 1 - 7 that influence cytotoxic potencies , and second , to derive predictive 2d - qsar models that will be helpful to design new analogs with improved bioactivity .
the proposed primary and auxiliary binding sites of cytotoxic n - aroyl-3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone analogs   the objectives of the present investigation are two folds .
in addition , the previous quantitative - cytotoxic activity study of asymmetrical 2,6-bis(benzylidene)cyclohexanones against mcf-7 , sk - n - mc and mda - mb-231 cell lines ( 20 ) , reported the spatial and topological parameters as determinant structural descriptors in cytotoxic potential of these compounds against the cell lines .
( s_aach ) and the sum of the electro - topological state indices of methyl groups ( e - state keys : s_sch3 ) are among the important influential descriptors in the cytotoxic potential of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones especially toward cem and molt / c8 cell lines .
the hypothesis of sequential cytotoxicity was advanced that the 1,5-diaryl-3-oxo-1,4-pentadienyl group interacts at a primary binding site and a side chain on the piperidine nitrogen may align at an auxiliary binding site which could enhance cytotoxic potencies . in order to evaluate this hypothesis , a novel series of n - aroyl-3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives 2 - 7 were synthesized ( 8) . in these compounds , the side chain contains atoms and groups capable of forming hydrogen and van der waals bonds and also an ionic bond in series 3 - 6 which could bind at an auxiliary binding site . when the potencies of the compounds in series 3 - 6 were compared with that of the analogs 1a - d which have the same aryl substituent , the ic50 values of the amides 3 - 6 were lower in 48% of the comparisons made while equipotency was noted in 35% of the cases ( 8) .
