to develop next - generation chemotherapeutics for cancer and other disease is important to 
 clarify the molecular mechanisms of c - nhej .
mutations of the 
 dna - pkcs , which cause scid , have been identified in not only humans , but also domestic 
 animals , i.e. , mice , horses or dogs .
expression and localization of cattle xlf in cattle cells : we examined the 
 expression and subcellular localization of xlf in cattle cells .
, we examined the expression and subcellular localization of cattle xlf and its 
 mutants in cattle cell line mdbk .
inherited mutations of core 
 c - nhej factors ( e.g. , dna - pkcs , dna ligase iv and xlf ) , have been discovered in humans 
 . on the other hand , inherited
, 
 we conclude that the xlf ctr is important for the accumulation of xlf at dsbs in both human 
 and cattle cells , although the role of the c - terminal region of xlf remains controversial in 
 human cells .
human xlf is the most recently identified core 
 nhej factor , and it appears to play essential roles in c - nhej .
homologues of the xlf gene were predicted in several eukaryotic 
 organisms . on the other hand , the expression , 
 function and regulation mechanism of xlf
