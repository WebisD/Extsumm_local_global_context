the tsh receptor ( tshr ) , 
 thyroid peroxidase ( tpo ) and dual oxidase 2 ( duox2 ) genes , for which it has been reported heterozygous defects 
 cause neonatal transient thyroid dysfunction , were analyzed in children with transient thyroid dysfunction or 
 subclinical hypothyroidism detected during neonatal screening .
two of the nine screening - positive children who had not received l - t4 replacement or had been 
 able to stop the treatment had genetic mutations .
the aim of this study was to determine whether transient thyroid dysfunction and subclinical 
 hypothyroidism detected during neonatal screening are influenced by genetic background .
therefore , it is important to continue long - term follow - up of children 
 with transient thyroid dysfunction and subclinical hypothyroidism detected during neonatal screening to avoid 
 missing the development of overt hypothyroidism and goiters , given that they may have background gene 
 defects . in conclusion ,
some subjects with 
 heterozygous tshr gene mutations were identified during neonatal screening , and the others were identified in 
 the course of evaluation for common nonspecific symptoms .
subjects with biallelic inactivating mutations of the 
 nis gene and tg gene have also been reported to show various phenotypes , from euthyroid to severe hypothyroidism 
 ( 17,18,19,20 ) .
