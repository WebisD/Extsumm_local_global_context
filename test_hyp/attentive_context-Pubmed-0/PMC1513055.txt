we aimed to 
 examine whether the changes in pleural fluid protein , glucose , 
 and lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) parameters , as well as in 
 il-1 , il-2 , il-6 , and il-8 levels , were significant in 
 differential diagnosis of childhood pleural effusions .
accordingly , a definitive diagnosis , a successful 
 treatment and reduction in mortality can be achieved .
protein levels 
 in pleural fluids were measured as 5.1  1.2  g / dl and 
 1.6  0.5  g / dl in the exudate and the transudate groups , 
 respectively ( p < .001 ) . glucose levels in pleural fluids were 
 measured as 53.3  36.6  mg / dl in the exudate group and 
 83.8  14.7  mg / dl in the transudate group ( p < .001 ) 
 ( figure 3 ) .
il-2 concentrations of pleural fluids were ascertained to be at 
 undetectable levels in 12 ( 44.4% ) and 176.6  173.6  pg / ml in 15 ( 55.6% ) patients in the exudate group . 

a statistically significant difference was found between crp 
 values   of the exudate ( 140.2  92.4  mg / dl ) and the 
 transudate ( 9.6  3.2  mg / dl ) groups ( p < .001 ) 
 ( figure 2 ) .
