apart from differences on neuroimaging there has been very little study of how these two clinical conditions differ in terms of their subjective and objective clinical profiles . taken altogether , our findings from the mmse , bna , oars , and nis show that despite similar levels of functional ability and objective cognitive function , vamci subjects have significantly more scc than mci subjects .
our findings support the existing view of mci and vamci as disorders with similar presentations with regard to objective function , but ultimately different etiologies .
differences in functional impairment between individuals with mci and those with vamci , which may be overlooked by objective cognitive testing , may be predicted by an analysis of significance of scc . in the current study , we compared the profile of scc in individuals with a diagnosis of mci to those with vamci using the neuropsychological impairment scale ( nis ) .
as previously discussed , mci and vamci subjects were matched on age , education , and social status and achieved statistically similar scores on the mmse and bna .
as well , vamci - specific deficits should be related to neuroimaging findings , in order to associate deficits with particular locations and severities of white matter disease .
