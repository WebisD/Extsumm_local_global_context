patients with t2 dm and ckd who initiated treatment with sitagliptin tended to be older and were more likely to have a pre - treatment history of heart failure , arrhythmia , or use of loop diuretics or beta - blockers than patients initiating other classes of oaha . in this context , it is worth noting the results of a large , recently completed clinical trial examining the effects of adding  sitagliptin to usual care in patients with t2 dm and cv disease . in the overall study population , no difference in cv event rates compared with placebo was observed ( hazard ratio [ hr ] for the primary composite cv outcome was 0.98 ; 95%  confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.88 , 1.09 ; p  <  0.001 for noninferiority ) . additionally , in patient subgroups evaluated by renal function ,
the differences between treatment groups ( non - dpp-4i oaha users versus sitagliptin users ) observed in patients initiating an escalation to dual therapy were similar to those observed in patients initiating monotherapy , with the exception that the between - group age difference was not as great ( mean [ sd ] : sitagliptin 71.1     years , non - dpp-4i 70.0     years ; asd 10% ) and the differences for history of arrhythmia and use of beta - blockers were not meaningful ( fig .  1c , d).fig .
