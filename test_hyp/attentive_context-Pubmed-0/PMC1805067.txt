unenhanced computed tomography ( low - dose ct ) in risk groups for lung cancer , spiral ct demonstrated non - calcified nodules in up to 66% of asymptomatic smokers with no history of malignancy .
the proportion of non - smokers or children with nodules is not precisely known but ct performed in these groups also frequently shows pulmonary nodules . 

the proportion of individuals with nodules was higher with thin slice thickness and use of multidetector ct   .
computed tomography ( ct ) , particularly spiral multidetector ct ( mdct ) is the method of choice for detection of pulmonary nodules . in a study using surgical exploration of deflated lungs as the gold standard , even single slice spiral ct had a sensitivity of 95% for nodules

the good sensitivity is maintained with low radiation dose ct 
 protocols   . on the other hand , not every nodule exhibited by ct
sensitivity for pulmonary nodules differs with different imaging modalities . whereas the sensitivity of chest radiography is relatively low ( solitary nodule rarely detected if < 5 mm , 50% detected if 610 mm , may be missed even if as large as 35 
 mm )   , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is more sensitive with sensitivities of > 50% for nodules
