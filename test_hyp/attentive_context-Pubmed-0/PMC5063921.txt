the utility of siderophore antibiotics by virtue of their activity against an array of esbls and cell access mechanisms is an encouraging development and may be one that clinicians are in need of , but we await the initial clinical findings with s-649266 .
many such infections are rapidly becoming resistant to life - saving drugs;1 thus , we may be on the verge of the post - antibiotic era .
perhaps most worrying is the report that 96% of klebsiella pneumoniae were esbl producers with 50% from community infections.3 although rates of these pathogens are lower in the us and most of europe , the rapid expansion of global travel leads us to realize that an infection may initiate anywhere and be manifested elsewhere .
the onslaught of multidrug - resistant bacteria is a global problem with the emergence and geographical expansion as a major clinical threat . in the past few years
indeed , it was also proposed that many of the procedures and conditions such as simple operations or cancer immunosuppression , which we take for granted today , may become impossible due to these organisms.2 extended - spectrum beta - lactamases ( esbl ) have become a global scourge in the past 20 years .
