  to describe the surgical technique and initial experience with a single - port retroperitoneal renal biopsy ( sprrb ) .
the hospital stay of all patients was two days because they were discharged in the second postoperative day , after remaining at strict bed rest for 24 hours after the procedure .
  sprrb is a simple , safe and reliable alternative to open and videolaparoscopic approaches to surgical renal biopsy .
after lower pole exposure , a laparoscopic biopsy forceps was introduced through the nephroscope working channel to collect a renal tissue sample .
the mean operative time was 32 minutes , and mean estimated blood loss was less than 10 ml .
a single 1.5 cm incision was performed under the 12th rib at mid - axillary line , and an 11 mm trocar was inserted .
mini - perc nephroscopes are not available at our institution at this time , but its use could be a step forward , in this regard , and further decrease the required size of the access port incision . additionally , the ease for urologists in using regular urological equipment , and the possibility that the surgeon simultaneously controls both the camera and laparoscopic scissor / biopsy forceps , are other advantages of this alternative method . in our hospital , retroperitoneal laparoscopy is the procedure of choice for renal biopsy in children and the sprrb is an even less invasive option for these patients , performed through a single incision and with very satisfactory results and only minor pain .
