tetralogy of fallot ( tof ) is a cyanotic congenital cardiac defect characterized by pulmonary outflow tract stenosis or obstruction , ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) , overriding aortic root , and right ventricular hypertrophy.1 left without surgical correction , the overall survival was poor and over 90% of the patients die by 40 years of age.2,3 there are some subsets of tof patients with advanced chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) ; however , the association between tof and renal failure severe enough to require dialysis treatment has been rarely reported in the literature.4,5 in this report , we describe the case of an end - stage kidney disease patient with tof .
we also discuss the complex processes of how and why peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) was selected as a mode of chronic renal replacement therapy in this case .
a 33-year - old female with tof managed by palliative surgery was admitted to our hospital with complaints of general fatigue and appetite loss at the end of december 2013 .
thus , the establishment of an optimal management program for end - stage kidney disease patients with congenital heart disease should be a matter requiring continuous and careful attention .
