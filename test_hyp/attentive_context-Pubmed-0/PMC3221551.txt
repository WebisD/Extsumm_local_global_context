2010 : us center for disease control and prevention ( cdc )   says that ' an essential strategy for keeping older adults healthy is preventing ncds and reducing associated complications ' .
, health promotion   should be used for primary universal and selective prevention strategies , whereas p4 medicine ( predictive , preventive , personalized and participatory )   should be used for primary , secondary and tertiary indicated prevention strategies . to prevent the occurrence of ncds by implementing effective action at societal and individual levels : to detect and diagnose disease at an early stage , when it can be controlled effectively . to stratify patients into groups , enabling the selection of optimal therapy . to reduce adverse drug reactions through the predictive or early assessment of individual drug responses and assessing genes leading to ineffective drug metabolism . to improve the selection of new biochemical targets for drug discovery . to reduce the time , cost , and failure rate of clinical trials for new therapies . to shift the emphasis in medicine from reaction to prevention and from disease to wellness .
