the aim of this study was therefore to assess the caries risk profiles in 2- to 6-year - old greek children with the aid of cariogram software and to evaluate the contribution of various risk factors among preschool children of different ages .
insufficient fluoride exposure had the strongest impact for the 2- to 3-year - old children , while impaired oral hygiene had the strongest impact for those aged 34 years , and the presence of white - spot lesions was most important among children over 4 years old .
for the 3- to 4-year - olds , the presence of dental plaque ( r=0.91 , = 0.71 , p<.001 ) was most prominent , while for the 4- to 5- ( r=0.89 , = 0.163 , p<.001 ) and 5- to 6-year - olds ( r=0.91 , =0.2 , p<.001 ) , the presence of white - spot lesions showed the strongest association .
the most significant caries risk variables were insufficient fluoride exposure and the presence of white - spot lesions .
high caries risk was found for 26% of the children examined , whereas 9% exhibited low caries risk .
the cariogram has been satisfactorily validated in teenagers9 and adults,10 although it was found to be less useful in younger schoolchildren11 and preschool children.12,13 in cross - sectional studies , the cariogram has been used to explore the caries risk profiles of adults,10,14 young adults,15,16 teenagers9,17,18 and schoolchildren.19 in only one previous cross - sectional study , the cariogram was used for 2-year - old children.20 as that study group was limited in size , it was of interest to further investigate the cariogram concept in a broader preschool setting .
