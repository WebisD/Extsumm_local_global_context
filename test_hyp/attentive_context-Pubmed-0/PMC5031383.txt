the following general description involving molecular chaperones shows the outline regarding the maintenance of physiological homeostasis of living body .
based on comprehensive studies of hsps , this review offers important information regarding the mechanism related with the characteristic procedure of signal pathway according to the specifically cared substrate of each hsp , structural characteristics , specifically expressed location and those roles .
over several decades , hsps have been known as a potent factor playing a role in maintaining the homeostasis of living body .
provoking these pathways in a positive way ( e.g. , physical exercise ) enhance hsps signal pathway and maintain / improve vital function of hsps in the living body .
the broad ranges of hsps are organelle - specifically expressed within the body to play physiological roles via interacting with various signal pathways .
heat shock proteins ( hsps ) are a group of proteins that repress the denaturation of molecules by various stressful circumstances such as exercise , gravity , heat , oxygen , ca etc .
accumulated studies show that hsp families are located in various sites within cell ; hsp10 , hsp60 , and hsp75 are located in mitochondria , however , others are present in the cytoplasm , cytosol , endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus in physiological conditions ( xu , 2002 ) .
