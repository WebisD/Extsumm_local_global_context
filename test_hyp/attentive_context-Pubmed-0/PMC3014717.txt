in conclusion , primary schoolchildren in urban sudan exhibited a high degree of overweight and obesity , and hypertension among these children was more closely linked to obesity than to family history . that obesity - associated cardiovascular sequelae exist in the developing world at such young ages
after adjustment for these factors , sudanese children who were obese had a relative risk of systolic hypertension of 14.7 compared to their normal - weight counterparts ( p < .01 ) .
is a harbinger of worsened cardiovascular outcomes in sub - saharan africa in the future . to overcome these trends , children in urban settings in africa are likely to require similar dietary and activity lifestyle adjustments as needed by their counterparts in developed nations
we found a high rate of overweight and obesity among 612-year - old primary schoolchildren in urban sudan , with 14.8% of the children overweight and 10.5% obese . despite moderate rates of hypertension reported previously among children in sub - saharan africa  up to 11% in rural children , suggesting an underlying genetic predisposition we found that obesity and not family history was the factor most strongly associated with hypertension in our sample .
