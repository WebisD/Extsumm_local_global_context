. herein , we present a rare case of a previously healthy young patient with acute pulmonary tuberculosis in the form of tb pneumonia that was complicated by ards .
both primary and reactivation tb may present as an acute illness and mimic cap . as a result of the impressive mimicry of tb , the diagnosis must be considered , at least initially , in all cases of acute pneumonitis , especially in regions where tuberculosis is endemic .
although the presentation of pulmonary tb as acute pneumonia is not unusual , its manifestation as acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) is rare .
a 21-year - old woman , a radiology technician student , presented with acute respiratory failure due to progressive respiratory symptoms , including productive cough and dyspnea that started seven days before presentation . at the time of her admission to the hospital
this case features a rare manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis in a previously healthy young woman with acute presentation of tuberculous pneumonia complicated by ards .
ards is a severe form of diffuse alveolar injury . the american - european consensus conference ( aecc ) ( 1994 )
defined ards as an acute condition characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia in the absence of evidence for cardiogenic pulmonary edema .
