  in western countries , breast cancer is a major concern and its incidence and mortality rates have been recently influenced by new therapeutic strategies
a great number of novel chemopreventative agents are currently under investigation in order to evaluate their efficacy in this particular cohort of patients .
available preventive strategies for nonhormonal breast malignancies , more frequently expressed in brca mutation carriers and , in general , in high - risk population , are needed . for these reasons ,
. our knowledge on cancer precursors , risk biomarkers , and cancer genetics has considerably increased , and prevention strategies are being successfully explored . unfortunately , over the last decade , breast cancer prevention has been mainly focused on endocrine therapies using selective estrogen receptors modulators ( serms ) and aromatase inhibitors ( ais ) .
in accordance with their recognized role in the regulation of cell growth , differentiation , apoptosis , and their recognized inhibitory effect on cell growth in er positive and negative breast cancer cells , retinoids ( either natural or synthetic compounds structurally related to vitamin a ) have long been studied for their chemotherapeutic effect and for their chemopreventive potential in breast cancer setting . only recently
