we present the case of a young woman diagnosed with 
 gallstones in late pregnancy , complicated by acute gallstone pancreatitis and 
 subsequently spontaneous common bile duct perforation .
a twenty - year - old primigravida woman was 
 planned for elective caesarean section due to breech presentation .
perforation of the biliary system occurs 
 most frequently in the gallbladder , usually associated with ( and complicating 
 upto 10% cases of ) acute cholecystitis .
thus , 
 because perforation of the biliary system is a recognised complication of 
 cholelithiasis , the diagnosis should be suspected if a perihepatic abscess or 
 peritonitis is combined with biliary stone disease . as early as 1882 , freeland   reported the first case of extrahepatic biliary system rupture in an adult ( diagnosed at autopsy ) , an entity that was 
 subsequently first described in pregnancy by piotrowski et al .   over a 
 century later . since this time ,
both cases presented a diagnostic dilemma , and it 
 was concluded that a history of cholelithiasis in a patient with persistent 
 intra - abdominal symptoms in the postpartum period must alert to prompt 
 investigation and early management .
of course , every case 
 must be considered individually , taking into account maternal and fetal 
 history and health .
