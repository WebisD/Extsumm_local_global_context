herein , we report a clinical case of irvan syndrome with both retinal neovascularization and macular exudation successfully managed with intravitreal ranibizumab ( lucentis ) as adjunctive therapy to rp .
a 42-year - old man came to our department with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his right eye ( re ) .
the idiopathic retinitis , vasculitis , aneurysms and neuroretinitis ( irvan ) syndrome is a retinal vascular disorder of unknown etiology characterized by three major criteria ( multiple leaking aneurysmal dilations , retinal vasculitis and neuroretinitis ) and three minor criteria ( peripheral capillary nonperfusion , retinal neovascularization and macular exudation ) .
retinal photocoagulation ( rp ) is the only treatment that has shown evidence to prevent the progression of the disease by acting on proliferative changes   .
we conclude that ranibizumab constitutes an effective and safe adjunctive treatment for irvan syndrome , contributing to the control and disappearance not only of the neovascularization but also of the macular exudates .
the case presented underlines that intravitreal ranibizumab alone can cause a reduction of the irvan - associated exudation .
irvan syndrome may progress rapidly to severe visual loss , mainly due to the development of exudative maculopathy and/or retinal ischemia , and its neovascular sequelae such as vitreous hemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma   .
