we report a case of giant genital warts where the patient complained of formication ( insect - crawling sensation ) which was subsequently found to be due to maggot infestation in the warts .
the simplest treatment for myiasis is application of an occlusive agent such as white soft paraffin , wax , glue , adhesive tape or chewing gum followed by physical removal of maggots .
due to rarity of condition , and our unfamiliarity we did not consider infestation by maggots though patient complained of crawling sensation and severe itching in the genital warts . the lesson learnt is to examine and investigate the patient thoroughly before dismissing patient 's complaints as irrelevant , psychogenic or functional , however unusual and unexplainable they are for the disease .
psychiatric and psychological morbidity has been reported in patients with genital warts . even though , genital warts are generally not associated with severe symptoms , they have profound adverse impact on quality of life of patients .
