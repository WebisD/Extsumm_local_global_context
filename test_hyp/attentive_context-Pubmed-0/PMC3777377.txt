we report a case , carbon dioxide ( co2 ) embolism a potentially devastating complication of laparoscopic surgery , during dissection phase and was successfully resuscitated .
thus , in laparoscopic surgeries early detection of gas embolism with prompt resuscitation can result in a favorable post - operative outcome .
a 35-years - old female , weighing 42 kg was posted for transperitoneal laparoscopic boari 's ureteric reimplantation .
aspiration of gas through central venous catheter is the definitive means of treating gas emboli . in our case ,
co2 embolism can occur either during peritoneal insufflationor during the surgical dissection . in this case ,
two - dimension echocardiography ( 2-d echo ) showed no patent ductus arteriosus or any other congenital defects .
possible causes of sudden cardiovascular collapse like hypovolemia , hemorrhage , vaso - vagal reflex , pneumothorax and endotracheal tube blockage were ruled out before considering gas embolism the adhesions caused by previous surgery might have led to vascular injury during dissection and the operating site was above the level of the heart ( trendelenburg position ) creating a pressure gradient thus the open venous channels , at lower pressure were open to gaseous medium at a higher pressure leading to gas embolism . either , slow infusion of air ( 0.01 - 2.00 ml / kg / min ) or bolus of gas ( 25 - 200 ml or 1 - 13 ml / kg ) , creates a  gas
