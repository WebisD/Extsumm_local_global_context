we observed interesting mri changes in a 39-year - old man with osteonecrosis of the femoral head at six  months after rao , which are reported here .
joint - preserving procedures for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head in young patients include core decompression , vascularized bone grafting , and proximal femoral osteotomy .
since 1995 , we have performed rotational acetabular osteotomy ( rao ) for 90 hips with osteonecrosis associated with collapse of the femoral head in young patients .
the rationale behind the use of this procedure to treat osteonecrosis of the femoral head is that it shifts the weight - bearing region to articular cartilage that is still supported by the intact lateral cortex of the femoral head .
early surgical intervention such as rao that alters the mechanical force acting on the necrotic region of the femoral head may accelerate the recovery from osteonecrosis and the improvement of symptoms .
we believe that achieving adequate acetabular coverage of the viable lateral portion of the femoral head by rao was the most important factor leading to resolution of necrosis in this case . in summary ,
there is a correlation between the outcome and the extent of osteonecrosis , whether the hip is treated conservatively or subjected to an operative procedure .
