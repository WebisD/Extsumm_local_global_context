folic acid modification of magnetic nanoparticles could be used to facilitate uptake to specific cancer cells for cancer therapy and diagnosis .
our results showed that the uptake of folic - acid modified nanoparticles by 5rp7 cancer cells was also much higher than that of 3t3 cells .
this modification can be used for successful targeting of cancer cells expressing the folate receptor .
this modification containing folic acid can be used for successful targeting of tumor cells expressing the folate receptor .
the interaction between folic acid and folate receptors expressed on the surface of cancer cells might have contributed to the improvement of nanoparticle uptake , based on receptor - mediated endocytosis.37 the schemes for the modification of nanoparticles display tem images ( figure 3 ) of ma - fol - modified with fe3o4 nanoparticles for this purpose , firstly , magnetic nanoparticles were imaged .
ma - fol was used to target preferentially cancer cells with folate receptors expressed on their surfaces , and to facilitate the nanoparticles to transit across the cell membrane .
this suggests that the modification of magnetic nanoparticles with ma - fol could be used to resist nonspecific uptake and thus avoid their recognition by macrophage cells , and simultaneously facilitate nanoparticle uptake to specific cancer cells for cancer therapy . in flow cytometry results , the population of annexin v - positive live cells in the cancer cell line increased in a time - dependent manner , and most ( 12.9% ) of the cells became annexin v - positive at 48 hours at a concentration of 4.5 g / ml .
