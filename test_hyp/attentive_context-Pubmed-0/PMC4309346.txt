extragonadal germ cell tumors ( eggcts ) have the same histological components as their 
 gonadal counterparts , but a gonadal mass is not detectable by palpation or high - resolution 
 ultrasonography ) here , we report a case of primary mediastinal seminoma with complete obstruction of the 
 superior vena cava and no recurrence of the residual mass after intensive chemotherapy .
reported that 10 surgical deaths occurred among 158 
 patients who underwent additional resection of residual primary mediastinal nonseminomatous 
 tumors ) like primary testicular seminoma , primary mediastinal seminoma has a good prognosis , and 
 the rate of necrosis of the residual mass is as high as 92% when partial remission is 
 obtained after chemotherapy )
based on the suspicion of a mediastinal tumor with lymph node metastasis , 
 mediastinal radiotherapy and methylprednisolone were immediately started .
our patient was first diagnosed as having an egct arising from the mediastinum when he 
 presented with chronic cough and complete obstruction of the superior vena cava . since few patients with early germ cell tumors arising in the mediastinum
biopsy of the 
 right subclavicular lymph nodes revealed metastatic seminoma ( figure 2
