therefore , it may be concluded that drug loaded floating microspheres in combination with kollidone sr are a suitable drug delivery system for hydrochlorothiazide .
out of 9 formulations tried , the formulation k1 was found to be satisfactory ; since it showed prolonged and complete release with 94.75% at end of 12 h. % drug release of all nine formulations
the present investigation described the influence of the drug : polymer ratio on hydrochlorothiazide release .
multi unit gastroretentive drug delivery system has additional advantage of absence of dose dumping as in single unit drug delivery .
several preformulation trials were undertaken for various proportions of drug and polymer by variation of the ethyl acetate - acetone ratio and dichloromethane - ethanol ratio .
it was found that kollidone sr microspheres show desirable high drug content , yield , floatation and adequate release characteristics and hence was suitable for development of a controlled release system . in the present study , in vitro release studies of the floating microspheres were carried out in 0.1 n hydrochloric acid at 37c for a maximum period of 12 hours . at different time intervals ,
it was found that the kollidone sr had a dominant role in the drug release from microspheres rather than acrycoat s 100 and cellulose acetate . and it can be given in hard gelatin capsule form .
