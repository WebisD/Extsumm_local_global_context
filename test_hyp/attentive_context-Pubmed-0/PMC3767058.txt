our study shows that donepezil unfolds cystatin which may not be able to bind to cathepsins ; therefore an imbalance of protease - antiprotease occurs in the presence of donepezil leading to considerable side effect of the drug as cystatins play significant role in several diseases like arthritis cancer and cardiovascular diseases .
drug inducing changes in protein function leading to adverse side effects is the area of continual scientific investigation   .  
the increased information available to clinicians might help in optimizing the use of these agents in the management of patients with alzheimer 's and other diseases .
such kind of changes have also been documented earlier , after interaction of ligands ( phytohormones , cytokinins , abscisic , and gibberellic acids ) with wheat germ agglutinin resulting in 60% increase in fluorescence intensity of native protein .
these studies enable to elucidate how ligand affinity is regulated and how the protein conformation is altered upon complexation   which is of crucial importance in a vast range of important biochemical phenomena . in the present work , structural and functional analysis of cystatin , a protein ubiquitously present in mammalian cells and tissues , was studied which showed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity due to unfolding of cystatin in the presence of donepezil ( figure 3 ) .
