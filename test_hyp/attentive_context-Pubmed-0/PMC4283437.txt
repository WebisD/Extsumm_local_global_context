since chlorogenic acids play an important role in human health , this study allowed us to elucidate the role of brewing techniques and type of coffee on cqas content of brewed coffee and subsequently allowing us to equilibrate the acidity of brews for consumers .
indeed , in order to understand the potential variation in the amount of cqas consumed by coffee drinkers and to go deeper into the influence of brewing techniques on concentration of phenolic compounds , various commercial coffee brews ( capsule , pod , instant , iced coffee , and iced cappuccino ) were assayed for their cqas content .
this investigation clearly demonstrated that coffee brews commonly consumed are capable of delivering high amounts of cqas as the major isomer in analyzed samples was 3-cqa , followed by 5-cqa and 4-cqa . besides that it was confirmed that brewing mechanisms have a profound effect on the amount of cqas delivered per cup .
this equilibration lets consumers to avoid consequences of high cgas consumption and at the same time they intake sufficient amount for medicinal purposes .
repeatability of the method ( intraday precision ) was estimated when the cqas standards at three concentration levels ( c1 , c2 , and c3 , see the concentrations in table 2 ) were analyzed on the same day for six injections .
