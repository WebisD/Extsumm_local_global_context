in addition , ergonomic improvement of surgical equipment to reduce the intensity level might be efficient in reducing muscle fatigue or at least increasing time - to - fatigue .
for the first time , this novel data analysis method is used in our study to quantify any possible muscle fatigue in real laparoscopic surgery operations which is known as prolonged and low - force muscle activity compared to some intense tasks which involve isometric muscle contraction throughout the whole task .
the main goal of this study is to answer the following questions : can objective manifestations of muscle fatigue be detected from emg data during a laparoscopic surgery as prolonged light muscle activation?what is time - to - fatigue for the muscles experiencing fatigue during laparoscopic surgery?which muscle has the highest possibility level of fatigue in laparoscopic surgery among the tested muscle groups ? can objective manifestations of muscle fatigue be detected from emg data during a laparoscopic surgery as prolonged light muscle activation ? what is time - to - fatigue for the muscles experiencing fatigue during laparoscopic surgery ?
in addition , moving average of % det of bilateral deltoid increased after 5560 minutes of operation as shown in figures 4(e ) and 4(f ) . between deltoid and trapezius ,
