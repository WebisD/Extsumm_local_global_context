the purpose of this study was to clarify whether anxiety affects the preoperative actual acidity and volume of gastric fluid with several contributing factors such as sex , age , fasting time , hypoglycemic status controlled in female patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia .
the preoperative anxiety score ( vas ) of l - group was 2.41.4 , and that of h - group was 6.00.9 .
the results suggest that a low level of preoperative anxiety can be considered a risk factor in connection with aspiration pneumonitis .
the mean gastric acidity and volume of the two groups were not statistically different : ph of l - group , 3.01.8 ( range : 1.3 - 7.3 ) , ph of h - group , 3.02.0 ( range : 1.3 - 7.8 ) , volume of l - group , 15.311.7 ml ( range : 0 - 50 ) , and volume of h - group , 11.811.8 ml ( range : 0 - 70 ) .
the mann - whitney u - test and chi - square test were used to analyze the anxiety scores , gastric ph and volume of the gastric fluid , serum gastrin concentrations , and the number of patients at risk for aspiration pneumonitis ( gastric ph < 2.5 and volume > 25 ml ) in order to compare both groups .
