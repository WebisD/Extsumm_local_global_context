this work details lelp - guided development of 
 this series , optimizing enzyme affinity while retaining selectivity 
 over hsnmt to yield 34c , a high affinity druglike plasmodial 
 nmt inhibitor .
previously 
 reported work described the discovery of 1 by a lead - hopping 
 approach , as a ligand efficient inhibitor of plasmodial nmt .
taken together , this biological 
 characterization shows that nmt is a highly promising target for the 
 development of a new generation of antimalarial drugs .
using an integrated chemical biology approach , 
 we identified the nmt substrate proteins in the blood stage of the 
 parasite and demonstrated with small molecule tools that on - target 
 inhibition of myristoylation disrupts the function of multiple specific 
 downstream pathways , resulting in rapid cell death .
furthermore , myristoylation of proteins is known to modulate 
 a variety of properties ( such as protein localization and stability ) and is implicated 
 in a variety of critical biological pathways . in the specific context of malaria , several important parasitic 
 proteins have been shown to require myristoylation in order to localize 
 correctly and to carry out their biological functions , and the genetic essentiality of nmt in p. berghei ( pb ) , the infectious species in the murine model of malaria , has 
 been confirmed by conditional knockdown experiments .
