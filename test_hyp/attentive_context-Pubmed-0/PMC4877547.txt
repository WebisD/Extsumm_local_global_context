for example , early theories regarding the pathogenesis of this condition , based on clinical observations and an experimental animal model , included intrauterine constraint811 ) . over the last quarter century , there have been many advances in the understanding of craniosynostosis , resulting in more rational management of the problems associated with this condition , both in its simple form and its syndromic manifestations315 ) .
these advances have included reduced emphasis on the technical aspects of this disease and greater emphasis on its pathology and natural history , along with more accurate analysis of the morphology of the craniofacial skeleton1310 ) .
centers with the appropriate vision and infrastructure are necessary to optimize the care of patients with craniosynostosis , as well as to enhance scientific knowledge and education about this disease .
knowledge gathered from these investigations may result in the future development of alternative strategies to enhance or perhaps even replace current approaches for the treatment of craniosynostosis .
more recently , genetic studies have identified the genetic loci of many craniosynostosis syndromes , as well has determining the downstream pathways associated with disease development .
craniosynostosis is a wonderfully descriptive term , meaning " the skull has fused bone " . however , it is also a fairly nonspecific clinical designation , encompassing multiple presentations ranging from isolated single suture involvement to multi - sutural fusions5 ) .
