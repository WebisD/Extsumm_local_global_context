a single 45-min bout of endurance - type exercise strongly reduced the prevalence of hyperglycemia over the course of 24 h. an increase in adl ( three 15-min bouts of postmeal strolling ) improved postprandial blood glucose homeostasis but did not significantly reduce the prevalence of hyperglycemia over 24 h. elevated blood glucose concentrations , which are most evident in the postprandial state , increase the risk for diabetes complications and mortality ( 16 ) . in the current study , type 2 diabetic patients exceeded the recommended upper limit for postprandial glucose concentrations of 10
1 ) , the prevalence of hyperglycemia over the course of 24 h was not significantly reduced ( 6 h 2 min  1 h 16 min ; p = 0.67 ) .
2c ) was significantly lower during both the adl ( 365  51 mmol / l/10.5 h ; p < 0.05 ) and moderate - intensity exercise condition ( 285  38 mmol / l/10.5 h ; p < 0.001 ) compared with the sedentary control condition ( 448  54 mmol / l/10.5 h ) .
in contrast , a single 45-min bout of moderate - intensity endurance - type exercise was shown to reduce the daily prevalence of hyperglycemia by 34% , along with a reduction of 0.6 mmol / l in average 24-h blood glucose concentrations ( fig .
