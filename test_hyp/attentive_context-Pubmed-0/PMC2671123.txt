ecological analyses showed trends indicating that the wmd in fpg was positively associated with that in fasting insulin ( r = 0.45 ; p = 0.04 ) and triglycerides ( r = 0.59 ; p = 0.004 ) and that the wmd in fasting insulin and triglycerides was mutually associated ( r = 0.43 ; p = 0.04 ) .
these associations remained significant after adjustment for whether a weight - loss diet was prescribed ( fpg vs. fasting insulin , r = 0.58 and p = 0.004 ; fpg vs. triglycerides , r = 0.44 and p = 0.04 ; and fasting insulin vs. triglycerides , r = 0.44 and p = 0.04 ) .
there was a relatively strong suspicion of publication bias for hdl cholesterol ( egger 's test , p = 0.08 for hdl cholesterol ; recommended level of significance , p  0.10 [ ( 32 ) ] ) . according to results of the compensatory trim - and - fill method
influence analyses indicated that there were a few outliers for percent change in total ( 22 ) , hdl ( 22 ) , and ldl ( 29 ) cholesterol ( see online appendix tables a1 and a2 , available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc08-1716/dc1 ) . when these trials were omitted from the analyses , percent change in total cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and ldl cholesterol significantly changed from 0.0% ( 95% ci 2.1 to 2.0 ) to 1.6% ( 4.5 to 1.3 ; p = 0.03 ) , from 10.4% ( 12.2 to 8.6 ) to 5.6% ( 2.9 to 8.4 ; p < 0.001 ) , and from 3.0% ( 6.3 to 0.4 ) to 0.1% ( 4.1 to 3.8 ; p = 0.001 ) , respectively .
