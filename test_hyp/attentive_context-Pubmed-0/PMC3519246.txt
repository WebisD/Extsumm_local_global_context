understanding the underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of a well - standardized screening test .
fundamentally , sss is a state of hyperreactivity to environmental stimuli , presenting with a clear clinical picture and resulting from a single underlying pathology or a combination of pathologies .
sensitive skin syndrome is a common and challenging condition , yet little is known about its underlying pathophysiology .
maibach described the cosmetic intolerance syndrome ( cis ) , which probably covers the bulk of the clinical presentation of the sensitive skin syndrome ( sss ) .
sensitive skin is a common term used by patients and clinicians , as well as the cosmetic industry , and represents a complex clinical challenge faced by dermatologists and other skin care professionals .
this will allow clinical studies to rely on objective findings rather than self - reports and this , in turn , may result in more comprehensive and efficient management strategies .
female self - perception of sensitivity is consistently increased compared to that of males , yet when put through objective reactivity testing the trend is unclear .
it is reasonable to organize the differential diagnosis by dividing sss into visible and invisible sss .
