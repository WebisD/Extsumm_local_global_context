we present a case of bilateral retinoblastoma with metastases to right forearm bones four years after the initial treatment .
an 8-year - old boy treated four years back for bilateral retinoblastoma with enucleation of left eye along with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy presented with a right forearm swelling .
metastatic disease is rare and usually occurs within the first two years after initial diagnosis , and is extremely rare after that time period .
however , metastases to forearm bones are very rare with only very few reports published till date . here
skeletal scintigraphy remains an essential diagnostic procedure in evaluation of these patients and can have important implications in management .
the prognosis for most children diagnosed with retinoblastoma is good , with a 5-year survival of rate of more than 90% .
an x - ray revealed a mass lesion in right forearm with destruction of lower one third of right ulna .
complications include local recurrence , metastases , and the development of a second primary tumor .
however , special stains excluded ewing 's sarcoma and other primitive neuroectodermal tumors ( pnets ) . involvement of radius picked up by bone scan had important implication in deciding the nature of disease as ewings tumor with multi - focal disease as second primary is very unlikely . tc99m - mdp bone scan ; ( a ) whole body anterior view ; ( b ) whole body posterior view showing increased tracer uptake in right forearm bones .
