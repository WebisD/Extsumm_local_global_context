this sign , especially in the absence of an arterial line for post - pda aortography , can help the operator release the ado safely .
patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) is a common congenital heart defect , and the incidence of isolated pda in full - term infants is about 1 in 2000 , accounting for approximately 5% to 10% of all types of congenital heart disease .
, we describe for the first time a sign that was extremely helpful during our use of the ado for the closure of pda .
transcatheter closure of pda is an established and safe method of treatment with no mortality and significant morbidity . in our study ,
this retrospective study recruited all patients scheduled to undergo pda transcatheter closure between september 2009 and september 2012 in rajaie cardiovascular , medical and research center .
the patients were assessed for residual pda , left pulmonary artery stenosis , and descending aorta stenosis intraprocedurally via echocardiography . in the case of the presence of significant complications ,
two patients had protrusion of the ado into the aortic artery but had no significant stenosis ; these patients did not have coarctation of the aorta on follow - up . in one of our patients ,
