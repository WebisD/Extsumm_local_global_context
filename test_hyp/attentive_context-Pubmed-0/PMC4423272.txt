we therefore examined the ic intubation rates , procedure duration , and maximal depth of enteroscope insertion among those patients who received a pre - colonoscopy followed by rdbe and compared the results with those who received a conventional rdbe .
the mean ( sd ) of maximal depth of insertion was 78.2 ( 18.1 ) cm and 67.2 ( 17.1 ) cm in the novel procedure group and the traditional procedure group , respectively , which were not significantly different ( p  <  0.65 ) .
the novel procedure group and the traditional procedure group had 3  /23 patients ( 13.0  % ) and 3  /22 patients ( 13.6  % ) with poor bowel preparation , respectively .
a computer program randomly chose 45 patients from a pool of all patients who underwent rdbe procedures during 2011    2013 . 
the two endoscopists performed 25 and 20 rdbes , and the failure rates when they used the traditional method were 3  /13 ( 23.1  % ) and 3  /9 ( 33.3  % ) , respectively ( p  <  0.01 ) .
alternative techniques to improve ic valve intubation have been described , including a study by ross et al 11 in which a balloon was inflated over a guidewire passed through the ic valve , and despott et al 10 in which the enteroscope balloon was inflated in the ti while the enteroscope and overtube were pulled back to straighten the ileo - colonic angle .
