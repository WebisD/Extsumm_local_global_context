after 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy , elderly males with metastatic prostate cancer exhibit declines in lean body mass and lipid oxidation , together with an increase in carbohydrate oxidation .
the goal of this prospective study was to determine the effects of adt on body composition and resting metabolic rate in patients with metastatic pca .
statistically significant differences in body composition pre and post orchiectomy were seen in terms of weight , body mass index ( bmi ) and lean body mass ( lbm ) .
no significant changes were observed in bone mineral density ( bmd ) and ree , but we identified a statistically significant change in terms of increased carbohydrate oxidation ( choox ) and a decrease in lipid oxidation ( lipidox ) .
aging is associated with sarcopenia ( loss of muscle mass ) , with an average 12 kg loss of lbm between the ages of 25 and 70 years and an increase in fbm of 18%36% during the same period.2 testosterone levels exhibit a positive correlation with lbm and a negative correlation with fbm .
sixteen men , aged 63 to 96 years ( mean age 71 ) , with untreated metastatic pca were enrolled in this study . prior to orchiectomy , all patients were evaluated clinically and by laboratory analysis to establish a baseline . after a careful medical history had been taken from each patient , we assessed several exclusion criteria , namely , cognitive alterations , depression and emotional liability .
