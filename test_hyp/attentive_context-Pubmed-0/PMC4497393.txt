the object of this study was to perform a surveillance study of imrt for post - operative cervical cancer in a working group within the radiation therapy study group ( rtsg ) of the japan clinical oncology group ( jcog ) .
data collection included : ( i ) the technical environment for imrt ; ( ii ) patient preparation before taking planning computed tomography ( ct ) ; ( iii ) the technique for determining the target volume and the normal structure ; ( iv ) the prescription dose , the dose constraint for organs at risk ( oars ) , how to define the prescription dose ; and ( v ) how patients were set up in daily treatment .
the radiation therapy oncology group ( rtog ) launched a multi - institutional prospective phase ii trial ( rtog 0418 ) using imrt for post - operative endometrial and cervical patients in order to determine whether imrt could reduce short - term bowel toxicity .
, it was regarded as important to ascertain the current status of imrt for post - operative cervical cancer in japan .
if imrt is to become a standard therapy for post - operative cervical cancer , which is unfortunately still a relatively common cancer in our country , many institutions will need to update their accelerators with modern machines ; this will contribute to improving the quality of radiation therapy in our country .
