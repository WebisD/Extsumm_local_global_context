reported a rare case of a newborn baby with an abdominal wall defect , together with multiple congenital abnormalities and diagnosed as gastroschisis .
gastroschisis associated with spinal and lower limb anomalies in early age group mother ( primiparous ) has been presented .
the present case was not completely considered within any known alternative diagnosis of gastroschisis - associated complex , non - syndromic and syndromic anomalies . the presented case of gastroschisis , therefore , highlight the associations of both spinal and lower limbs anomalies in primiparous , which was proven to be a rare case .
cardiac and genitourinary abnormalities have been associated with gastroschisis , but presence of extra - gastrointestinal anomalies warrants search for alternative diagnosis . in the presented case ,
gastroschisis is a right - sided , small , and full - thickness paraumbilical defect of the abdominal wall that occurs in 1 of 4000 births . unlike an omphalocele ,
performed an international study to identify malformation patterns and to evaluate the role of maternal age in non - isolated cases of gastroschisis and associated defects .
the best estimate of the proportion of gastroschisis associated with major unrelated defects is about 10% , with a few cases associated to recognizable syndromes .
