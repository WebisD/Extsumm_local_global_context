we examined the patient with total double - balloon endoscopy ( dbe ) and located multiple submucosal tumors .
we report a case of a successful laparoscopic operation for multiple carcinoid tumors in the small intestine without intraoperative endoscopy . total digestive tract observation using dbe
a 75-year - old woman in whom the bleeding focus could not be found by upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal ct was admitted for evaluation of anemia .
multiple carcinoid tumors of the small intestine are rare and are very difficult to detect preoperatively .
based on the case presented here , we recommend total digestive tract observation using dbe before performing laparoscopic operation for multiple tumors of the small intestine .
we report the first case of multiple carcinoid tumors of the small intestine preoperatively diagnosed by dbe and treated with laparoscopic surgery .
this is the first report of laparoscopic surgery without the use of intraoperative endoscopy for multiple carcinoid tumors of the small intestine , which was possible because the tumors were diagnosed before surgery by dbe .
dbe is extremely useful to detect and diagnose asymptomatic small lesions in the small intestine .
for this reason , if laparoscopic surgery is performed in a patient who was diagnosed as having multiple carcinoid tumors of the small intestine , it is usually necessary to perform intraoperative endoscopy to confirm that the lesion is a carcinoid tumor .
