the goal of our study is to identify the alterations of chromosome and gene in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om , which may provide new insights into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis . with high - resolution g - banding techniques , both the numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities were observed .
since carcinogenesis is caused by the stepwise accumulation of genetic changes , it is very important to understand the alterations of chromosome and gene in cancer cells . the traditional giemsa banding ( g - banding ) technique is applied to detect cell sample with a higher mitotic index , but lung cancer cells have a lower mitotic index , which makes karyotypic analysis difficult . in our study , combining with the latest molecular biology techniques , we investigated the chromosomal and genetic alterations in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om . here
, we summarized the chromosomal and genetic abnormalities detected in lung cancer cells and discussed the possible implication of those alterations in the processes of tumorigenesis .
characterizations of complex chromosomal abnormalities in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om were showed by g - banding analysis , and the wrong number of chromosomes was present in almost all cells .
