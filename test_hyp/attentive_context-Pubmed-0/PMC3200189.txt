hence , to explore the mechanism of actions of daidzein , its effect on cell proliferation , mammary gland differentiation , and the expression of ers in a prepubertal mammary tumour model was carried out .
since the more differentiated the mammary gland is , the less susceptible it is to cancer incidence , dietary intake of daidzein from an early developmental stages may be beneficial to women folk in particular , which can be further confirmed through clinical trials .
the highest susceptibility of a rat mammary gland to a carcinogen occurs in the postpubertal virgin females around the age of 50 days , which correlates well with the higher number of tebs and the high cell proliferation , and a low incidence of mammary carcinoma is related to the loss of tebs and the low cell proliferation activity .  
experiment 1a total of thirty - six animals ( female sprague dawley offsprings ) of the same age were divided into 3 groups of 12 each . on postnatal days 16 , 18 , and 20 , while group ii and iii were injected subcutaneously with 500  g / g body weight daidzein and 500  ng / g body weight of estradiol benzoate ( eb ) , respectively   , an equal volume of vehicle ( dmso ) was injected to the animals of group i ( control , dmso ) . on the 21st day , 18 hours after the last injection ,
