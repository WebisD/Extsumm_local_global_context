the diagnostic accuracy for aki tends to be more effective in pediatric patients and early aki predictive time . to improve the diagnostic value of urine il-18 , more appropriately designed investigations ( e.g. with randomized design and eliminating potential confounders )
the results of this meta - analysis indicate that urine il-18 had a pooled diagnostic or of 5.11 and the estimated area under the curve ( auc ) of the mean roc plot was 0.77 ( q  =  0.71 ) , with a high heterogeneity in pooled sensitivity and specificity .
we found a diagnostic or of 5.11 ( 95  % ci 3.228.12 ) for urine il-18 level to predict aki ( cochran - q  =  28.19 , p  =  0.0017 ) with a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 0.51 ( heterogeneity chi - squared 84.53 , p  <  0.001 ) and 0.79 ( heterogeneity chi - squared 62.84 , p  < 
thus , we performed a systematic review and meta - analysis to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of il-18 level for predicting aki . since there is no clear consensus about the appropriate cutoff level of il-18 to predict aki and different thresholds
so subgroup analysis was performed and proved that urine il-18 level in pediatric patients and the early aki predictive time group ( < 12  h ) was more effective in predicting aki , which might principally account for the heterogeneity .
