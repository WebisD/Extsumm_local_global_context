number of ( a ) insertion / deletions , ( b ) high - confidence substitutions and ( c ) chromosomal rearrangements are plotted across all the samples from the 10 patients that were whole - genome sequenced .
the subsets of samples in which validated substitutions , indels and rearrangements are found correlate strongly with the subclonal clusters identified from the clustering of substitutions from wgs , providing support for the existence of these subclones .
in addition , indels and rearrangements identified in wgs represent datasets orthogonal to the substitution data from which the subclones were identified .
pcr - gel experiments yielded a high validation rate for three of the four patients included in the validation .
the primary means of validation was a deep sequencing validation experiment that included selected substitutions and indels from each sample , as described in extended data table 2 and supplementary information , section 2b .
for this sample , we therefore assessed the veracity of the breakpoints by visual inspection of the associated copy number segments and confirmed that 82% were high - confidence events resulting in visible copy number changes . to identify potentially oncogenic events within regions of copy number changes , we intersected the affected genomic segments with genes previously shown to be recurrently amplified / deleted .
