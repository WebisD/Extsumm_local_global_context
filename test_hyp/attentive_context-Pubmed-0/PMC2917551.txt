the aim of the present work is to apply a specific isolation method based on the enrichment of black yeasts by simulating in batch solid state - like cultures the environmental conditions that are found in gas biofilters for the treatment of volatile aromatic hydrocarbons .
different environmental samples related to the life cycle of e. dermatitidis were used as inocula .
the occurrence of black yeasts in the human - dominated environment has previously been underestimated due to the application of routine microbial isolation methods . under common laboratory culture conditions ,
the application of the enrichment method used in the present paper contributes to the isolation of fungi that have a potential for bioremediation of sites polluted with monoaromatic hydrocarbons .
despite the medical and environmental relevance of herpotrichiellaceous black yeasts , little is understood on their biodiversity and natural occurrence . in order to address questions on niche shifts and environmental prevalence in relation to virulence factors and routes of transmission ,
numerous protocols for the selective isolation of black yeasts have been developed during the last decades ( an overview is presented in table  3 ) , which have yielded new data on the presence of these fungi in a wide range of artificial environments , sometimes with no obvious counterpart in nature .
