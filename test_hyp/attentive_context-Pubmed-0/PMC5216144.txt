we herein report a patient with an infected thoracic aortic aneurysm mimicking anti - proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( pr3-anca)-associated vasculitis .
vegetations in the descending aorta , which were detected using transesophageal echocardiography , contributed to the diagnosis in this case .
, we herein reported an unusual case of infected descending aortic pseudoaneurysm with luminal pathognomonic oscillating vegetation and with serological findings and clinical features mimicking pr3-anca - associated vasculitis .
anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ancas ) correlate well with a wide spectrum of vasculitis manifestations , including wegener 's granulomatosis , microscopic polyangiitis , and churg - strauss syndrome , all of which are commonly referred to as anca - associated vasculitis ( 1 ) .
several infections , particularly infective endocarditis , have been reported to show positive findings on anca tests ; furthermore , their clinical features have been acknowledged to mimic anca - associated vasculitis , which may lead to a misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment ( 2,3 ) .
however , to our knowledge , infected aortic aneurysms have not been reported to show positive findings on anca tests .
a woman in her 60s was admitted to the nagoya city university hospital complaining of a fever , which had persisted for three weeks , along with a loss of appetite , proteinuria , hematuria , and renal dysfunction .
