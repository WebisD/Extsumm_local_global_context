the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of a single bout of exercise on memory consolidation and the release of the neuroendocrinological parameters bdnf and cortisol .
at that time point , participants of a relaxing group recalled more words than participants of a high - intensity exercise group and participants of a low - intensity exercise group .
the present results provide evidence that high - intensity but not low - intensity physical exercise led to less forgetting of newly learned vocabulary compared to a relaxing group . furthermore , high - intensity exercise increased the release of bdnf and cortisol in humans .
however , participants who engaged in high - intensity exercise for 30 minutes after learning showed better memory consolidation compared to the relaxing group assessed 24 hours after the learning session ; that is , they retained more of the initially learned words .
however , it remains an open question whether bdnf and cortisol are mediators of exercise induced benefits on memory .
the difference between the immediate memory test and the 24-hour test for the low - intensity group was between the same difference for the high - intensity group and the relaxing group , suggesting a dose - response relationship between exercise intensity and memory consolidation .
