the purpose of this study is to highlight the use of a combination  of a locking plate and an intramedullary fibula in the management of nonunion of the humerus in a severely osteoporotic bone .
our results show that this combination is useful and reproducible for the management of nonunion of the humerus in a severely osteoporotic bone .
we included 5 patients in the study due to the relative rarity of this type of combination in patients .
the average age of the patients in our study was 57 years ( range , 5167 ) .
all patients were protected in an arm sling for a period of three weeks after the surgery .
reports about the management of nonunion of the humeral diaphysis in severely osteoporotic bone are uncommon .
it is important to understand the methods of treatment and indications for such treatments of these fractures.3 , 4 nonunion of the humerus is an uncommon complication of diaphyseal fractures .
osteoporosis is defined by the who as a bone mineral density ( bmd ) of 2.5 standard deviations or more below the young normal  mean . on this basis
none of the patients had pain over the fracture site and the dash score at the last follow - up averaged 27 . interestingly 2 patients complained of some amount of discomfort at the graft harvest site in the immediate postoperative period only due to peroneal muscle movement .
