the est - ssrs developed in this study , in combination with previously reported est - ssrs , will provide valuable resources for constructing high - density genetic linkage maps , mapping quantitative trait loci , assessing germplasm polymorphism and evolution , marker - assisted selection , and cloning functional gene in chinese cabbage . to our knowledge , this is the first successful attempt to develop large quantity of est - ssrs with high quality based on the transcriptome of chinese cabbage using high - throughput rna sequencing technology .
furthermore , serving as a validation purpose , we tested polymorphisms of 24 est - ssrs .
we expect this study can pave the road for further investigation of new est - ssr markers and for construction of high - density genetic maps .
primer pairs for 24 est - ssrs were selected for primer evaluation , and 79.2% of the 24 est - ssr loci successfully generated high quality amplicons . among the effective primers , 89.5% of them showed polymorphism in 24 cultivars of chinese cabbage .
could also be identified for further studies such as high - density genetic linkage map construction , gene / qtl mapping , and cultivar identification . in our previous study , the whole transcriptomes were analyzed for the rosette leaves and folding leaves of a typical heading chinese cabbage , namely , fushanbaotou , using a solexa / illumina rna - seq platform , and a large - scale est database was generated . in this study , we further assembled those ests from the rl and fl libraries into nonredundant unigenes .
