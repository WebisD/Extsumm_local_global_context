frequencies of scores for emotional exhaustion , depersonalization and personal achievement emotional exhaustion correlated with depersonalization emotional exhaustion correlated to personal achievement depersonalization correlated to personal achievement linear regression revealed surprising trends in the univariate analysis model expecting the night shift to have higher ee and dp scores with lower pa scores when compared to the day shift which was not supported in this study . in the final model , moderate and high categories for ee ,
managerial and non - managerial positions had no significant effect on ee ( p = 0.28 ; ci : 0.695 - 3.594 ) . moderate or high dp ( p  0.05 ; ci : 2.587 - 10.14 ) and pa scores ( p  0.5 ; ci : 1.236 - 4.622 ) had a significant effect on moderate or high ee scores rns had also higher burnout rate when compared with rts ( p < 0.05 ; ci : 1.085 - 6.937 ) .
these variables were also tested as originally stratified and then collapsed yielding no significance . in the analysis of night shift and day shift , night shift nurses had less degree of burnout when compared with the day shift nurses and regression analysis showed the night shift to have a protective effect although with a wide confidence interval ( ci ) ( p < 0.05 ; ci : 0.256 - 0.976 ) .
