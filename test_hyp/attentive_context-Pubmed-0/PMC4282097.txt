we now report on a further characterization of the response of the isovolumetric rat bladder to tn and sn stimulation , including a comparison of bilateral and unilateral stimulation , evaluation of desensitization to continuous and repeated stimulation , and the effects of simultaneous stimulation of spinal and tns .
neuromodulation has been established as an effective treatment for patients with overactive bladder ( oab ) where first - line therapies , such as the muscarinic antagonists , do not provide sufficient efficacy.1 currently , the two most common approaches to neuromodulation are sacral spinal nerve ( sn ) stimulation using the interstim device and percutaneous tibial nerve ( tn ) stimulation using the urgent pc. sacral neuromodulation is included in the oab treatment guidelines of american urological association ( aua ) , european association of urology , and international continence society.2,3 percutaneous tn stimulation is listed as optional therapy in the aua treatment guidelines.2 using a rat model in which reflex bladder rhythmic contraction ( brc ) is induced by filling with saline , we have characterized the relationship between inhibition of reflex bladder contraction and the frequency and intensity of sn stimulation.4 we have also compared the effects of stimulation of different bladder nerves , including spinal , tibial , and genital.5 dorsal genital nerve stimulation has not been approved clinically for oab treatment and is not included in this study .
