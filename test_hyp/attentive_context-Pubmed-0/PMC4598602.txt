no data are available about the distribution of periostin in adult human gingival in normal conditions , and because its potential role in gingival pathologies , we used western blot and immunohistochemistry to analyze the occurrence and localization of periostin in these tissues . to establish whether periostin is cellular or extracellular we labeled in parallel keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts
, our study has demonstrated the localization of periostin in the ecm of the periodontal ligament and the cell - free zone of the dental pulp in adult human teeth .
although some images occasionally might suggest co - localization of periositin witn vimentin or cytokeratin 2d cytofluorograms from the two detection channels of periostin ( green ) and cytokeratin or vimentin ( red ) demonstrated absence of co - localization ( figure 2 j - l ) . as a summary , in human normal gingiva periostin is extracellular and is restricted to the epithelial - connective tissue junction , and among the fibroblasts forming the non - bone attached segments of the periodontal ligament .
this study was designed to investigate the occurrence and distribution of the segregated matricellular protein periostin in the human gingiva .
regarding to the gingival segment containing the non - bone attached periodontal ligament , disposed under the junctional epithelium , the distribution of the periostin immunoreactivity was irregular , and never co - localized with the vimentin - positive fibroblasts ( figure 2 g - i ) .
