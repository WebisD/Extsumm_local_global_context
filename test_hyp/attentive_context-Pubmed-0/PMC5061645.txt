neurogenic muscle hypertrophy is very rare , but we recommend clinicians consider this problem when patients complain of lower limb hypertrophy and pain .
a 74 year old woman visited our clinic , who had been suffering from pain in the low back and right lower limbs and right calf hypertrophy .
one posits that the hypertrophy is produced as a secondary result of chronic muscle stimulation . in a case that features chronic muscle stimulation
gibson and waddell   reported that microdiscectomy is the effective way to reduce radiculopathy and muscle hypertrophy . in the present case
calf hypertrophy can be caused by l5 , s1 nerve root compression , as in the present case .
it is mostly caused by nerve root compression . among the body regions deformed by hypertrophy ,
myopathic muscle hypertrophy is evident with a diffuse lesion , which is centralized on the muscle , not a nerve innervated lesion .
, muscular hypertrophy has a myopathic cause and a neurogenic cause . to discriminate between these , a proper neurologic examination and laboratory tests such as muscle enzyme test , emg , mri , and muscle biopsy are needed .
the gastrocnemius and soleus are the muscles related with ankle plantar flexion , in which part of the innervation is from the tibial nerve from the s1 - 2 nerve root .
