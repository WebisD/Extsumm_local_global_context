we report a case of ppss that eventually metastasized to the heart in a 17-year - old female .
primary pleuropulmonary synovial sarcoma ( ppss ) is a rare soft tissue malignancy representing only 0.1% - 0.5% of all primary lung malignancies .
both cases had a primary tumor in the extremities rather than in the lungs without focusing on the imaging findings of these rare lesions ( 2 - 4 ) .
a 17-year - old female presented with dull pain in the left upper chest alternating with brief periods of chest discomfort lasting a few months .
the frequency of cardiac metastasis from soft tissue sarcomas ranges from 3.5% to 35% with only two cases of metastatic synovial sarcoma of the heart reported : one involving the right ventricle and the other the left ventricle .
ppss is a rare mesenchymal spindle cell malignancy representing a type of pulmonary sarcoma that comprises 0.1% - 0.5% of all primary lung malignancies .
ppss with cardiac metastasis is also extremely rare , and only two such cases have been reported .
combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and ifosfamide has been associated with higher rates of survival in patients with synovial sarcoma ( 6 ) . in summary , ppss is a very rare , aggressive malignancy that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of lung and pleural malignancies .
