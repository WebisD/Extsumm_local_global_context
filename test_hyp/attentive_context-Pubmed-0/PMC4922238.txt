chondrosarcomas ( cs ) is a locally aggressive condition resulting in the formation of cartilage rather than bone from the mesenchymal tumor cells .
a 55-year - old female patient reported to us in march 2009 with complaints of a slowly enlarging mass involving the lower jaw for the last 5 years .
the areas of occurrence are related to the position of embryonic remnants of cartilaginous tissue such as nasal septal cartilage in the anterior region of the maxilla and meckel 's cartilage in the posterior region of mandible .
approximately 90% of cs are slow growing , low grade , non - metastasizing tumors .
this condition mostly affects femur , humerus , pelvis , and the sacrum accounting for 10 - 12% of all malignant bone tumors . in the maxillofacial region , maxilla is more commonly affected than the mandible , comprising less than 2% of all jaw tumors .
lichtenstein and jaffe described cs as a lesion that develops directly from a sarcomatous stroma , developing from full - fledged cartilage and not showing neoplastic osteoid tissue and bone .
cs usually begins with a slow growing mass , with or without pain , associated with displaced and mobile teeth .
