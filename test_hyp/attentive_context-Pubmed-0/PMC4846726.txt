the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of clinicopathological factors including age , gender , tumor grade , tumor stage , lymphovascular invasion ( lvi ) , tumor necrosis and previous history of non - muscle invasive bladder cancer on cancer specific survival ( css ) and overall survival ( os ) .
on the univariate analysis , variables such as gender , grading , tumor stage , lvi and tumor necrosis were all demonstrated to be significant prognostic factors affecting css and os after rnu in a patient with utuc . on the other hand on the multivariate analysis only lvi remained statistically significant .
upper urothelial tract carcinomas ( utuc ) are rare tumors that account for about 5% of genitourinary malignancies . despite the introduction of minimally invasive techniques and the revisions in some of the indications for radical surgery , especially for low risk patients , radical nephroureterectomy ( rnu ) with bladder cuff excision
lvi may explain the different clinical course in patients independently and might be considered as part of the pathological reporting and treatment planning .
statistical analysis was performed to assess the prognostic effect of age , gender , tumor grade , tumor stage , lymphovascular invasion ( lvi ) , tumor necrosis and previous history of non - muscle invasive bladder cancer on cancer specific survival ( css ) and overall survival ( os ) among patients treated for utuc .
