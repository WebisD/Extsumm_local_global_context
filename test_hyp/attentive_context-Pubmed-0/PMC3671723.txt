we further hypothesised that the previously noted beneficial effect of the four test substances   would be associated with stable or decreased apoptosis and proliferation , thus confirming the interest of these substances in developing a multidimensional dietary strategy to reduce the onset and progression of the canine endothelial degeneration involved in progressive valvular diseases .
therefore , the present study aimed at development of an in vitro model on the basis of cnaoec , in order to characterize the potential beneficial or detrimental effects of different test agents with respect to canine endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis .
of note , the observed antiapoptotic and antiproliferative effects were similar in human endothelial cells and the tested canine endothelial cells for the antioxidants gsh and nac as well as for the insulin sensitizers pio and rosi   .
this type of study is a rational step providing key information regarding the potential benefits of these substances in the canine species . in conclusion , this is the first study showing that pomegranate extract and soy isoflavones inhibit apoptosis and proliferation in canine aortic endothelial cells .
due to the increasing amount of evidence linking endothelial dysfunction to the onset and progression of heart failure in dogs   , it is important to have a method of screening and/or testing substances that may have potential to protect endothelial function in vitro .
