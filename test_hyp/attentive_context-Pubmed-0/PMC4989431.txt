to the best of our knowledge , our study is the first meta - analysis that evaluates the clinical utility of synovial fluid crp in the diagnosis of pji . in our study , we compared the diagnostic performance of synovial fluid crp with the consensus - based guidelines .
meanwhile , prospective studies are in urgent need to further validate our findings , and more synovial fluid biomarkers of high sensitivity and specificity are required in clinical practice for the diagnosis of pji .
therefore , in this study , we aim to conduct a meta - analysis to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of synovial fluid crp for diagnosing pji .
the heterogeneity for sensitivity and specificity was tested through i range ( 0 and 26.8% , respectively ) . pooled sensitivity and specificity of crp in the diagnosis of pji .
this systematic review has constituted a primary foundation for evidence - based guides on the diagnostic performance of synovial fluid , which can provide recommendations to clinicians for diagnosing pji accurately and efficiently .
our study is the first meta - analysis that evaluates the clinical utility of synovial fluid crp in the diagnosis of pji
. although the number of studies included in our meta - analysis is limited , all the included studies are highly qualified and illustrate the high sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid crp in discriminating pji patients from those who had undergone joint replacement and showed similar symptoms .
