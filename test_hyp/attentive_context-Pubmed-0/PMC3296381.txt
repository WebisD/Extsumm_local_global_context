palatal rugae can be studied as a strong indicator of ethnicity , gender differentiation and study of growth changes in the anterior maxilla .
the objective of this study was to analyze and characterize the rugae patterns , compare the rugae dimensions in various age groups and to ascertain any relationship between dimensional analysis and palatal depth .
cross - sectional casts of 52 females and 48 males were selected from the archival section of the department of orthodontics , m. m. college of dental sciences and research , mullana ( ambala ) and studied employing following parameters : 
 assessment of age ( according to erupted teeth).gender differentiation ( based upon records).division of medial palatal region into : 
  a  : distance between incisive papilla length and anterior limit of the anteriormost rugae.b  : distance between incisive papilla and posteriormost rugae limits.lateral rugae dimensions . 

the majority of the study cohort ( 57% ) had a palatal depth in the range of 1.6 - 2.0 cm [ table 2 ] .
significant correlation was found between the  a ( p=0.03 ) and  b values ( p=0.02 ) on comparing the mean  s.d .
correlations among  a  ,  b  , lateral rugae patterns and palatal depth were calculated by mean  s.d . followed by evaluation of  p values .
