further studies about complex relations between hcn channels and other ion channels and about mechanisms underlying modulation of voltage dependence will provide us a concrete step for clinical usage of hcn channel modulation .
because hcn channels can work both excitatory and inhibitory , and these effects can be altered by pharmacological modulation , hcn channels are one of the promising pharmacological targets in treating diseases of the brain .
hyperpolarization - activated and cyclic nucleotide - gated ( hcn ) channels , first identified in 1976 in the heart by noma and irisawa   and characterized by brown and difrancesco   and weiss and his colleague , are cation channels that open when the membrane potential is hyperpolarized .
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ( pip2 ) is also known as a modulator of hcn channels ; it shifts the voltage dependence through a different mechanism from that of camp   .
based on the multifaceted features , hcn channels are involved in many kinds of functions that range from cellular to behavior levels ( working memory task , initiation of neuropathic pain ) . in this paper , we focus on neuron - level functions , which include regulation of resting membrane potential , normalization of synaptic inputs , selective filtering for coincident inputs , modulation of intrinsic cellular frequency characteristics , and regulation of membrane resistance .
