the current study aims at assessing the prevalence of bruxism among the jazan university students and checking its association with their khat chewing habit .
about 47.2% of bruxers have reported pain in comparison with the nonbruxers ( table 4 ) . in the analysis of multiple logistic regression , a strong association of stress ( p = 0.00 ; or = 5.902 , 95% ci 2.61413.325 ) and
the stress assessed in the study population was significantly on a higher side , with 87% of males and 89% of females reporting stress in their life ( inclusive of relationships and academics ) .
the khat use ( p = 0.05 ; or = 1.629 , 95% ci 0.3607.368 ) with bruxism was seen among the study sample ( table 3 ) .
thus , out of the variables assessed , only khat use and presence of stress were associated with the bruxism .
high amount of stress and khat use can be considered as important risk indicators for awake bruxism .
also , the same age group ( 2125 years ) was seen to be more indulged in the use of khat , coffee , and tobacco when compared to the other age groups .
