all 64 radiotherapy centres in the uk were contacted by email in june 2012 to request their contribution to the study , with collation of responses taking place during june to august 2012 .
a benchmark data set of brachytherapy hdr and pdr qc testing has been presented which is representative of practice across the uk .
qc testing schedules must be designed intelligently , including risk - based assessments of need rather than simply maintaining historic tests .
centres were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire on their routine qc practices and other aspects of hdr and pdr service provision . to enable a contextual review of qc practice , initial questions were asked included equipment type , average patient workload , sites treated , source strength calibration methods , level of image guidance , and prescribing practice . a spreadsheet containing a comprehensive list of possible quality control tests for treatment and planning equipment
inclusion of tests in qc schedules varies from 31 centres ( 100% ) for source strength measurements to just 2 centres ( 6% ) for mri tests , the latter of course being due to limitations of access to mri for brachytherapy - specific clinical use and qc testing ( it was not recorded how many centres routinely used mri for brachytherapy planning ) .
