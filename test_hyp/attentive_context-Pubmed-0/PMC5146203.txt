rats were then trained in a response learning task in the water plus - maze that requires the use of dls - dependent habit memory . following training sessions , rats were given systemic ( experiment 1 ) or intra - bla ( experiment 2 ) administration of propranolol immediately before cs exposure .
the present findings indicate that the enhancement of dls - dependent habit memory produced by exposure of rats to fear css is blocked by systemic ( experiment 1 ) or intra - bla ( experiment 2 ) antagonism of -adrenoreceptors .
2016 ) . considering that propranolol blocked the fear cs enhancement of habit memory , propranolol administered in the acute aftermath of trauma
in addition , propranolol administration blocked the fear cs - enhancement of habit memory in the present study , consistent with the hypothesis that noradrenergic activity also underlies the mnemonic benefit of exposure to aversive css .
the fear cs enhancement of habit memory observed in the present study may be considered a putative animal model of this proposed mechanism , whereby the conditioned emotional stimuli represent the trauma - related cues that enhance dorsal striatum - dependent memory processes and lead to the development or expression of behavioral avoidance symptoms in ptsd .
