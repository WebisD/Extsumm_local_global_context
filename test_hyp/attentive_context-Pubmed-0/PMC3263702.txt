although surgical series have not shown any survival benefits , the patient 's quality of life may be improved   . in this paper , we review the clinical , endocrine , and radiological features of the metastatic sps tumors with currently accepted therapeutic options based on the pertinent literature . in addition , we report six cases from our institution and discuss their management with long - term clinical outcome .
a systematic review of the literature was performed using pubmed and the bibliographies of reviewed articles .
the medical records of six patients admitted to the university of utah health sciences center between 2001 and 2011 were reviewed retrospectively .
metastatic lesions comprise approximately 1% of the tumors in the sellar / parasellar ( sps ) area for which patients undergo transsphenoidal surgery ( tss )   ; however , it has been reported in autopsy series that the rate of metastasis to these areas could be as high as 28% .
neoplasms originating from a multitude of sites have been reported to metastasize to the sps region . breast and lung cancer account for approximately two - thirds of sps metastases , being the most common sources in women and men , respectively ,   .
