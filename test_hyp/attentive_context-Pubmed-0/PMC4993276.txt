the continuous nri and idi for predicting the presence of ao using the model with the copd - ps questionnaire against the ipag questionnaire were 0.107 ( 95% ci , 0.2730.058 ; p=0.203 ) and 0.014 ( 95% ci , 0.0330.006 ; p=0.182 ) , respectively , and these were not statistically significant ( table 5 ) .
however , compared with the copd - ps questionnaire , the ipag questionnaire had superior likelihood ratios for both a positive ( 2.51 vs 2.59 ) and negative test ( 0.45 vs 0.40 ) , with nonoverlapping cis ( table 4 ) .
it is composed of three copd - related items ( breathlessness , productive cough , and activity limitation ) and one question , each regarding smoking history and age.15 in a previous population - based study , we verified the validity of the japanese version of the copd - ps questionnaire for the identification of individuals at increased risk of airflow limitation.16 this instrument is easy to score and would be suitable for large - scale screening of possible airflow obstruction ( ao ) .
the japanese version of the copd - ps questionnaire should be an adequate measure for large - scale screening for possible ao .
