in conclusion , we have shown that an ultrathin au layer has a drastic influence on the subsequent growth of fe - based nanostructures on the si(111 ) surface .
it is elaborated that this theory is applicable for our system and as such , we present a novel approach for interpreting surface diffusion and island nucleation in reactive systems .
our recent results on noble metal induced surface reconstructions prove that an ultra thin buffer layer and the induced surface structure have a major influence on the final morphological island properties [ 1 - 3 ] . in order to obtain a better understanding of the microscopic details of the self - assembly process , we investigated in detail the effect of the au - induced   superstructure on the subsequent diffusion of adatoms and the nucleation of fe - si nanostructures on si(111 ) . whereas we previously investigated the morphological properties ( e.g. , size , height , phase formation , density , etc . ) of the islands on different au - induced surface reconstructions   and the cu - induced reconstruction , we now specifically focus on the   reconstruction to investigate the microscopic details of the diffusion and nucleation processes on this particular surface .
