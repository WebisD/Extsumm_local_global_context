the key to successful rescue therapy with rifabutin  amoxicillin  ppi regimen may be to increase doses of ppi and amoxicillin .
from december 2007 to may 2013 , 59 h.  pylori - infected patients with two previous eradication failures were enrolled for this study prospectively .
a , h.  pylori eradication was achieved in 25 ( 78.1% ) of the 32 patients in the itt analysis and in 25 ( 80.6% ) of the 31 patients in the pp analysis . in group b ,
h.  pylori eradication was achieved in 26 ( 96.3% ) of the 27 patients in the itt analysis and in 27 ( 100% ) of the 27 patients in the pp analysis .
our study shows that as empirical third - line therapy , rifabutin - based high - dose ppi and amoxicillin combined therapy is more effective in patients with refractory h.  pylori infection after two eradication failures with key antibiotics such as clarithromycin , metronidazole , and tetracycline previously prescribed .
clinical characteristics of patients eradication rates of helicobacter pylori the most common adverse events were epigastric pain in the three patients ( 9.3% ) versus one patient ( 3.7% ) , epigastric discomfort in two patients ( 6.2% ) versus , one patient ( 3.7% ) , and nausea in one patient ( 3.1% ) versus one patient ( 3.7% ) , in the groups a and b. there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of adverse events ( table3 ) . reported side effects were mild , and treatment was well tolerated .
