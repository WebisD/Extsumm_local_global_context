high correlation can be found between the general rate of annoyance / sleep disturbance and variables dealing with traffic noise .
the combination of traffic and neighbourhood noise is significantly associated with hypertension and stroke whereas the general rate of noise annoyance ( and sleep disturbance ) is significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease .
only one association was significant for source - specific factors  the association between traffic noise and hypertension .
we have also studied the association of subjective responses to noise with selected chronic diseases ( hypertension , ischaemic heart disease and stroke ) .
prevalence of diseases  number of cases ( percentages ) data collected in 2007 revealed a significant relationship between a number of subjective responses to noise and occurrence of diseases , and the outcomes are presented in table 6 . for significant associations , the odds ratio ( or ) ranged from 1.2 to 1.8 for hypertension , from 1.3 to 1.8 for ischaemic heart disease ( including heart attack ) and from 1.8 to 3.3 for stroke .
 which indicator better explains probability of disease : ( subjectively perceived ) traffic noise , neighbourhood noise , combined exposure or the total rate of noise ( irrespective of the source ) ?
