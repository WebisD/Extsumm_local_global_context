we hypothesized that the joint effect of serum 25(oh)d and dbp levels is tightly linked to the risk of frailty and serum dbp levels might affect the correlation of 25(oh)d and frailty .
we conclude that the joint effect of serum 25(oh)d and dbp levels may be tightly linked to frailty , or serum dbp levels modify 25(oh)d - frailty relationship in the older men .
as shown in table 3 , participants in the lowest quartile of 25(oh)d ( q1a ) and the highest quartile of dbp ( q4b ) levels , those in the lowest quartile of 25(oh)d ( q1a ) and the lowest quartile of dbp ( q1b ) , and those in the lowest quartile of dbp ( q1b ) and the lower quartile of 25(oh)d ( q2a ) levels had significantly higher or of being frail compared with those in the highest quartile of 25(oh)d ( q4a ) and lowest quartile of dbp ( q1b ) ( reference group ) , with or of 3.18 ( 95% ci : 1.464.56 , p < 0.05 ) , 2.63 ( 95% ci : 1.313.68 , p < 0.01 ) , and 2.52 ( 95% ci : 1.223.52 , p < 0.05 ) , respectively , adjusting for age , bmi , and education . these results showed that , in the setting of the lowest quartile of 25(oh)d levels , both the lowest and the highest dbp levels confer increased risk for frailty , suggesting a
