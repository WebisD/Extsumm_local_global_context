a high attack rate of influenza was followed by entero / rhinovirus and then by rsv , coronavirus and parainfluenza .
agespecific incidence of respiratory viruses was highest in young children but with unexpected high incidence of entero / rhinovirus in this group .
, we sought to determine agespecific incidence of laboratoryconfirmed respiratory virus infection occurring in the hutterite community and to document the temporal relationship of virusspecific attack rates .
influenza b was not detected among those aged 30 and among those 4049 years of age and older , a decline in incidence was observed for entero / rhinovirus , coronaviruses , rsv , and influenza a. the incidence of parainfluenza increased among those aged 4049  years and older ; in contrast , hmpv ( human metapneumovirus ) was not detected in those 2029  years of age or older ( figure  1 ) .
the incidence of entero / rhinovirus in this age group was significantly higher than coronavirus ( 027/1000 persondays , ci : 021033 , p  =  001 ) and to rsv ( 006/1000 persondays , ci : 003009 , p  =  0005 ) .
the epidemic midpoint for seasonal influenza was march 23 , 2009 , whereas individual date values for influenza a ( h1n1 ) , a ( h3n2 ) , and b were march 9 , april 7 , and april 18 , respectively . for coronaviruses , parainfluenza viruses , entero / rhinovirus , rsv , and hmpv these values were march 2 , march 2 , april 30 , march 9 , and march 27 , respectively .
