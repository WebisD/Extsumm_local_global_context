screening patients with possible encephalitis at the time they seek hospital care regarding recent exposure to date palm sap and to other patients with encephalitis demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting niv encephalitis , particularly during peak months of niv encephalitis incidence .
since 2006 , surveillance physicians have listed and collected blood from those patients encephalitis , defined as fever or history of fever with axillary temperature > 38.5c ( 101.3f ) and altered mental status , new onset of seizures , or new neurologic deficit  in patients admitted to 3 nipah surveillance hospitals : rajshahi , rangpur , and faridpur medical college hospitals .
the institute for epidemiology disease control and research and us centers for disease control and prevention tested serum with an igm - capture enzyme immunoassay to detect niv igm , and we defined laboratory - confirmed niv encephalitis as niv igm in serum . during december 2012march 2013 , surveillance physicians interviewed accompanying caregivers of all hospitalized patients whose illness met the encephalitis case definition on admission in the inpatient ward .
surveillance for other diseases with well - described exposures that put healthcare workers at risk , such as ebola virus infection , and where laboratory diagnosis is limited or delayed could also deploy this approach .
