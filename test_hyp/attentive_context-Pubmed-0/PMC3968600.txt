a detailed description of patients with history of recurrent respiratory infections and progressive renal failure was given 1979 .
an 8-year - old male child presented with a history of facial puffiness and edema of one year duration .
we present a rare case of kin who initially presented with normal renal parameters ; interestingly , this patient 's clinical presentation was of nephrotic syndrome whose biopsy also revealed fsgs .
the case under discussion has various rare features like young age of the patient , associated glomerulopathy causing nephrotic syndrome and normal renal function , which is showing gradual deterioration .
normal renal function at the time of diagnosis is known and in one large series published by bhandari et al .
kin is a rare disorder characterized by enlarged tubular epithelial cell nuclei and chronic interstitial nephritis .
hence , we think that the patient has idiopathic fsgs with an incidental kin , which is known to occur sporadically .
he was diagnosed to have nephrotic syndrome and was treated by a local physician with steroids .
in contrast our case clinically presented with nephrotic syndrome and also had histological evidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs ) . as there is no positive family history or drug history and exposure to toxins ,
