. chronic lower respiratory tract disease , defined as asthma , emphysema , chronic bronchitis , bronchiectasis , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , is the third leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older.1 according to 2010 census data , 13% of the us population , or 40.3 million people , are older than age 65 , which is higher than any previous census .
additional research is needed to improve our understanding of the determinants of lung aging and the effects on lung immunity .
there are many complex changes in immunity with aging that increase susceptibility to infections , including a less robust immune response from both the innate and adaptive immune systems . finally , copd has the highest prevalence in the elderly and deserves special consideration in regard to treatment in this fragile population .
additionally , the population is aging at an increasingly faster rate each year . between 2000 and 2010 , the population age 65 years and over increased by 15.1% compared to the total us population which only increased by 9.7%.2 with such a large and rapidly growing aging population it is critical to understand how the body changes with age and how this impacts the entire respiratory system . understanding the aging process in the lungs is necessary in order to provide optimal care to our aging population .
