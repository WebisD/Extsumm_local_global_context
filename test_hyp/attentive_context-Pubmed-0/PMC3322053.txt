thus , candidatus n. mikurensis should be considered when diagnosing bacterial infections associated with tick bites .
the relatively high prevalence in common rodent species suggests that the risk for humans and domestic animals to encounter infected i. ricinus nymphs and adults is substantial .
in the present field survey of anaplasmataceae in swedish rodents , we have amplified 16s rrna and groel sequences identified as candidatus n. mikurensis identical to sequences obtained from humans .
this organism has been amplified from humans with febrile illness on 4 occasions ( 13 ) , demonstrating that candidatus n. mikurensis can cause human infections , at least occasionally .
apart from the first human case , to our knowledge , candidatus n. mikurensis has not been detected in sweden .
the prevalence of candidatus n. mikurensis was similar in all investigated rodent species in our study with a mean value of 8.8% .
we found the organism was completely absent in shrews , which suggests that they might not be competent hosts for these bacteria . we conclude that candidatus n. mikurensis is geographically widespread in southern sweden and that several rodent species , the main source of blood meals for larvae of i. ricinus in sweden ( 15 ) , can be infected .
