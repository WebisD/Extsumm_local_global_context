isolated left ventricular noncompaction ( lvnc ) is a congenital cardiomyopathy caused by a defect in endomyocardial morphogenesis.1 ) it is characterized by prominent trabeculation and deep intertrabecular recesses , resulting in thickened myocardium consisting of 2 layers - compacted and noncompacted myocardium.2 ) lvnc is occasionally combined with other congenital cardiac diseases3 - 6 ) and genetic cardiomyopathies.7 ) its clinical manifestations include heart failure , thromboembolism , ventricular tachyarrhythmia , and sudden death.8 ) the risk of embolic complications was mostly associated with impaired systolic function.9 ) there were only a few cases about coexisting left ventricular aneurysm.10 - 12 ) we report a rare case of lvnc associated with left ventricular ( lv ) aneurysm , presenting with recurrent embolism .
therefore , we suggest that anticoagulation therapy might be needed in patients with lvnc with coexisting lv aneurysm , even in the absence of systolic dysfunction or atrial fibrillation . in conclusion , we described a rare case of lvnc with lv aneurysm presenting as recurrent thromboembolic events .
a 40-year - old woman was admitted to our hospital for abdominal and lower back pain lasting for 10 days . in 1999 , she had an embolic stroke of the right middle cerebral artery territory ; however , after 2007 , she was lost to follow - up and discontinued all medications , including antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy
