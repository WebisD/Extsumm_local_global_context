we report a rare complication of silent and late device embolization of the asd occluder device into the right pulmonary artery , three months after implantation .
secundum type atrial septal defect ( asd ) is one of the most common congenital heart defects that occur in adults.1 ) in the past , asd was closed surgically .
percutaneous device closure of asd has been developed as an alternative treatment to surgery.2 ) the first percutaneous device closure of asd was performed in 1974.3 ) percutaneous device closure has several advantages over surgery , including less surgical morbidity , avoidance of a scar and reduced hospitalization duration.4 ) however , this method of closure is associated with rare early and late complications .
a 16 year - old patient presented with dyspnea . clinical examination revealed normal vital parameters with a fixed split second heart sound and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border .
surgical closure of an asd is the gold standard treatment regardless of the size and number of defects present in any clinical case.2)5 ) percutaneous transcatheter closure of asd is an established alternative treatment to surgical closure as it has lesser morbidity , shorter hospital stay , lack of a scar , and comparable rates of complications.4 - 6 ) however , percutaneous device closure is associated with rare early and late complications such as migration or embolization of the device , pericardial effusion , arrhythmias , thrombus formation on the device , and mitral regurgitation and vascular injury.4)7)8 ) the most frequent complication of percutaneous transcatheter closure of asd is device embolization with incidence ranging from 4% to 21%.9 ) embolization usually occurs within 24 hours and after that , it is rarely seen .
