in addition , we analyzed the degree of spermatogenesis to evaluate the fertility of these patients .
after surgery , the pathologist should perform immunohistochemical staining for plap and oct 3/4 , which are frequently expressed in testicular malignancy , because itgcn may be overlooked when using h&e staining alone .
between january 2002 and august 2012 , we performed orchiectomy in 31 postpubertal patients ( aged 12 years or over ) with unilateral cryptorchidism after counseling them about the risk of malignancy , androgenic dysfunction , and male infertility .
, we should discuss the possibility of androgenic dysfunction and male infertility with the patient .
furthermore , the incidence of itgcn has markedly increased over the past decade , and hence , it is essential that it is promptly and accurately diagnosed in patients with cryptorchidism . in the present retrospective study , we aimed to determine the incidence of itcgn in postpubertal cryptorchidism , and the usefulness of immunohistochemical staining in its diagnosis .
we suggest that preventive orchiectomy should be performed in cases of postpubertal cryptorchidism because of its malignant potential and subsequent risk of infertility in some patients . before performing preventive orchiectomy
one patient ( 3.2% ) , a 20-year - old man with abdominal cryptorchidism , was confirmed to have itgcn based on immunohistochemical nuclear staining for plap and oct3/4 in the surgical specimen ( fig .
