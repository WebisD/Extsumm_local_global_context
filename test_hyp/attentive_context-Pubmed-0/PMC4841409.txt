therefore , in this study , we determined the expression pattern of olig1 in neural cells during rat spinal cord development .
to determine the expression and localization of olig1 in different types of neural cells , we performed double immunostaining using the antibody against olig1 and another antibody against o4 , mbp , -tubulin , and gfap , respectively .
in conclusion , we systematically explored the expression pattern of olig1 in neural cells during rat spinal cord development .
olig1 was localized in the cytoplasm of o4- or -tubulin - positive cells during the transition from e14.5 to adult .
our results showed that olig1 was coexpressed with o4-positive opcs and -tubulin - positive neurons at all time points during development .
we also analyzed subcellular localization of olig1 in neural cells and found that olig1 was localized in the cytoplasm of coexpressed cells at all time points during rat spinal cord development .
opcs undergo two types of differentiation , resulting in ols in the absence of serum or type ii astrocytes in the presence of serum in vitro.2931 fate - mapping studies have shown that opcs generate a subset of astrocytes during perinatal development.32 most neurogenic bhlh transcription factors , for example , mammalian achaete - scute homologue 1 , mammalian atonal homologue , and neurogenins 1 and 2 , are only expressed transiently in progenitor cells as needed.23 in this study , we observed the transient expression of olig1 in gfap - positive cells at e14.5 , suggesting that ols and astrocytes may derive from the same progenitor cell .
