possibilities to successfully combine brain tumor surgery and epilepsy surgery will improve , and we will be able to longitudinally study the influence of various treatment strategies on the network . in short , we will be able to study the plasticity of the brain in a direct and non - invasive way .
although we are only in the very beginning of unraveling the extremely complex network architecture of the brain , the findings in brain tumor patients may prove to be of great importance for our future strategies in the treatment of these patients .
it has been shown that both types of cerebral function disruption are associated with changes in functional connectivity and network architecture .
these disturbances may consist of function loss ( especially loss of complex functions ) , and epileptic seizures .
when reviewing the current knowledge in neuro - oncology , there is a strong need for theory regarding the complex relations between the tumor on the one hand , and epilepsy and cognitive and emotional status on the other hand .
it is a great challenge to clarify the underlying mechanisms accounting for the changes in the brain s functional status resulting from the presence of this foreign entity and leading to cognitive impairments , to an alteration of emotional functioning , and to epileptic seizures .
