these results are slightly higher than the values of the sbs of miracle mix in permanent teeth , which were found to be 4.08 mpa.14 another study conducted in 1996 put the value of sbs of miracle mix at 5 mpa without pre - treatment and 6 mpa with pre - treatment that is almost in accordance with our values.16 the present study showed the sbs of ketac molar , which is a high viscosity , condensable , improved , restorative gic to be 4.84 mpa .
amalgomer cr has better adhesion to the primary teeth compared to miracle mix and ketac molar .
a study conducted in 2001 showed its sbs to be 3.77 mpa , which is slightly lesser than our value.13 amalgomer cr exhibited sbs of 6.38 mpa , which is significantly higher than that of miracle mix ( metal admixed ) and ketac molar ( high viscosity gic ) .
three types of fractures were recorded - adhesive fracture ( figure 4 ) , cohesive fracture ( figure 5 ) and mixed type of fracture ( graph 2 and table 2 ) .
the chi - square statistic ( pearson s chi - square ) revealed that there was no significant association between the failures and the groups ( p = 0.347 ) .
