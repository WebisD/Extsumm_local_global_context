the purpose of this study was to compare the effect of adding different doses of intrathecal meperdine on the incidence , intensity and other side - effects during delivery under spinal anesthesia .
finally , the use of intrathecal meperidine can not be recommended for the prevention of shivering during spinal anesthesia for caesarean section as its use is associated with increased incidence of nausea and vomiting and we need to treat shivering with safer drugs .
although increasing the dose of intrathecal meperidine can decrease the incidence and intensity of shivering it can also increase the incidence of nausea and vomiting that can be a major problem in these patients .
according to this study , shivering continues to be a common problem after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery , with unknown etiology and no definite treatment .
demographic and surgical data vomiting was increased with higher dose of meperidine and was most common in group iv .
first need forpostoperative analgesia in groups ii , iii , iv compared to standard group was ( median time to need analgesic drug):130,140,140 versus 80 min,(p<0.05 ) . need for analgesic drugs was more in the standard group ( 17.6%)(p = 0.000 ) but was not significantly different between experimental groups ( 4.6% , 4.8% and 4.3% , respectively ( p = 0.641 ) .
