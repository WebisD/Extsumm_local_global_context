the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of mthfr 
 c677 t mutation and its association to cad and to fasting plasma 
 thcy concentrations in moroccan population .
we also evaluated 
 interactions between mild elevated thcy levels , mthfr c677 t 
 polymorphism , and conventional risk factors of cad .
the mutant genotype had the more adverse effect ( or = 11.72 , 95% ci : 4.9127.96 , p <
traditional risk factors were 
 associated to a significant increased risk of cad in subjects with 
 677ct and 677cc genotypes , while hhcy were the main and sole risk 
 factor of cad in subjects with 677tt . for an eventual strategy of 
 cardiovascular disease prevention in morocco ,
in fact , in subjects with the 
 wild - type genotype , the cad risk increase was significantly 
 associated to smoking habits , obesity , dyslipidemia , and 
 hypertension . in heterozygous individuals ,
in the studied moroccan population , elevated thcy level is a 
 strong risk factor for cad independently of the traditional risk 
 factors , and this cad risk increase is strongly influenced by 
 mthfr c677 t polymorphism .
taking the 
 wild - type genotype as a reference , the mutant genotype increases 
 the risk of cad by  2 fold ( or = 2.17 , 95% 
 ci : 1.124.20 , p < .05 ) , while the cad risk increase associated to the mutant allele ( 677 t ) was  1.5 fold compared to the 
 wild - type allele 677c ( or = 1.54 , 95% ci : 1.111.84 , 
 p < .01 ) .
