furthermore , considering the higher frequency of mthfr 677tt genotype in china and the higher stroke risk associated with tt genotype , our results also provide some explanations for the ethnic differences in diabetic complications seen between east asian patients and europeans .
relationship of mthfr 677ct polymorphism , baseline homocysteine levels , and egfr with the risk of nod in the full models , we observed that higher tg , bmi , fpg levels , and insomnia , in addition to mthfr c677 t polymorphism in females , and higher fpg levels and insomnia in addition to lower egfr levels in males remained independent risk factors for the risk of nod ( data not shown ) . in the stratified analyses ,
previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the homocysteine levels in patients with diabetes . a recent meta - analysis of 14 case  control studies found that the mean homocysteine concentration was greater in patients with type 2 diabetes than in control subjects . however , the 3 studies that contributed most to the overall estimate included patients with type 2 diabetes accompanied by varying degrees of kidney disorders .
therefore , in the current study , we aimed to evaluate the effect of mthfr 677ct polymorphism , homocysteine , and egfr levels on the risk of nod in a rural chinese cohort , and to identify the possible effect modifiers .
