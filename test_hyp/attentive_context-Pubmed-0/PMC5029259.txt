leprosy is a chronic disease caused by mycobacterium leprae affecting the peripheral nervous system , the skin , and other tissues .
histoid leprosy ( hl ) is an uncommon variant of lepromatous leprosy ( ll ) , first described by wade in 1960 .
review of literature could reveal only two case reports of association with hl ; one with bt leprosy similar to the index case and the other with indeterminate leprosy .
it is usually seen in patients relapsing after dapsone monotherapy and also in the presence of dapsone resistance .
nonetheless , there have been reports of single lesion bl and ll cases reported in the literature albeit not in association with histoid lesions .
morphology and distribution of skin lesions in the index case is in conformity with hl .
it is characterized by skin colored papules and/or subcutaneous nodules and plaques on apparently normal skin with distinct histopathology and characteristic bacterial morphology .
he gives a history of the hypopigmented and hypoesthetic patch on the left leg 10-years ago , diagnosed as borderline tuberculoid ( bt ) leprosy and was advised for treatment .
the case under study is a young male aged 27 years , is in concert with reported male preponderance and the age group ( 2140 years ) reported in the literature .
