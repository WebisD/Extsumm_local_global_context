here we report a rare case of esthesioneuroblastoma in a female with presenting symptom as tooth pain .
olfactory neuroblastoma or esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of neuroectodermal origin arising from olfactory membrane of the sinonasal tract .
so , it may be considered as a possible differential diagnosis , though rare in cases of dento - facial pain of idiopathic cause .
, this tumor has been difficult to recognize and diagnose pathologically and the wide spectrum of presentation of this tumor has resulted in its frequent misdiagnosis .
the various synonyms used for this entity are olfactory esthesio - neuroepithelioma , esthesio - neurocytoma , esthesio - neuroepithelioma , esthesio - neuroblastoma , olfactory neuroblastoma and olfactory placode tumor . the first case in american literature
a 50-year - old female reported to the department of oral medicine with the complaint of pain in the left side of the upper jaw since seven months , which was spontaneous , dull and reduced on taking analgesics .
this tumor has broad histologic spectrum and is often histologically confused with peripheral neural ectodermal tumors and is notorious for its wide clinical behaviors .
thus , the diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma demands a specialized and experienced head and neck pathologist , especially as incidence rate is low . also , esthesioneuroblastoma may present , only as tooth pain as in the present case .
