, we focus on the role of cholesterol and its metabolites on the pathogenesis of nafld , and also the validity of cholesterol management as a method of treating this disease .
histological features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) include steatosis , hepatocellular ballooning , the formation of mallory bodies , apoptosis / necrosis , and inflammation .
it is also clear that inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance are closely associated with fatty liver during the progression of nafld . in previous studies that examined lipid metabolism in the context of nafld , dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism
the  two - hit theory  is increasingly being adopted to explain the pathogenesis of nafld and nash . in this theory , the first hit consists of the accumulation of fatty acids / triglycerides in the liver , while the second hit involves oxidative stress , mitochondrial dysfunction , and inflammation , which ultimately cause liver damage .
around 1020% of patients with nafld have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) , which can develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma   .
the potential clinical benefit of cholesterol management for treating nafld with respect to hepatic steatosis and injury should be estimated in appropriately designed trials .
