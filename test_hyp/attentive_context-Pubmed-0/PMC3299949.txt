when an ist following a wingspan stent placement for intracranial stenosis occurs with a coincidentally hemorrhagic complication , the deployment of another stent in - stent should be considered as a treatment option .
in - stent restenosis occurs in approximately 30% of patients after delivery of the wingspan stent , although many of these incidents of re - stenosis remain asymptomatic .
when vascular perforation is detected during a procedure , the treatment should immediately begin with a reversal of anticoagulant , lowering the blood pressure and/or temporary or permanent closure of the ruptured vessel . as in this case ,
mr angiography revealed a severe stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery ( mca ) .
a 66-year - old female was presented to the emergency room with sudden weakness on her left side and dysarthria while taking aspirin .
we have found several reports regarding the use of stent - in stent technique for recanalization of the late in - stent restenosis following the wingspan placement   . however , to the best of our knowledge , this present case is the first case that has recanalized acute ist using a stent in - stent technique and without using the thrombolytics .
