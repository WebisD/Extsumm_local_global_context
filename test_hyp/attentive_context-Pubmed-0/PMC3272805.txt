this study provides additional information regarding the relationship between semen parameters and spontaneous conception and regarding the indication for etiological treatments also in presence of severe reduction in semen parameters .
the role of the endocrinologist / andrologist is primary and necessary for a complete diagnostic evaluation and etiological therapeutic opportunity , as reported in a large series of pregnancies achieved in a single tertiary - care center experience .
we report a large retrospective study in a population of infertile couples who conceived after aetiological therapies .
this was achieved by a unified clinical management of the couple , which includes gynecologists , endocrinologists , and andrologists , with specific interest in the field of human reproduction .
, we applied a standard protocol in terms of investigation and therapeutical management of couples affected by infertility , performed in both partners in a sequential and parallel way .
we confirmed previous data about the impossibility for semen parameters to lead to a clear - cut discrimination between fertile and infertile men .
, we also evaluated sperm parameters at admission and after the therapies , the last carried out before conception , in the group with oligoasthenoteratospermia ( oat ) .
