the recent data demonstrating responses in heavily pretreated patients with refractory ewing sarcoma bring a wave of excitement to move these therapies to the forefront .
the ewing sarcoma family of tumors , including ewing sarcoma and the more differentiated counterpart , primitive neuroectodermal tumor , are the second most common primary malignancies of bone in childhood and adolescence   but can also occur in the soft tissues .
clinical trials are under way to assess the feasibility and efficacy of combining anti - igf-1r therapy with multiagent chemotherapy . over the next 5 years
human monoclonal antibody therapy directed against the igf-1r holds great promise for improving the prognosis for children , adolescents , and adults with ewing sarcoma .
systemic chemotherapy is aimed at treating known or micrometastatic disease as well as improving local control of the cancer .
although there have been improvements in the outcome for patients with localized disease , the outcome for patients with metastatic disease and for those who relapse is poor , with survival rates of 20% for those with metastases   and 10 - 20% following a recurrence .
early studies documented the major autocrine role of the igf-1 and igf-1r pathways in ewing sarcoma , and expression of igf-1r has been shown to be a requirement for ews / fli-1 transformation in fibroblasts .
