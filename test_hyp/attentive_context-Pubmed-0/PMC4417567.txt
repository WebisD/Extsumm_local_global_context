this review addresses current knowledge of the biological aspects involved in msc immunoregulatory capacity and the clinical focus of these characteristics that allows these cells to be used in the treatment of several diseases with an immune component involved .
mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) , also referred to as multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells , have been a focus of recent research , partially because they are an extraordinary model for investigating the biological mechanisms that allow a cellular population to generate diverse cell types and because they are a potential tool in cellular therapies for several clinical applications .
this review culminates with a clinical description of the diseases treated with mscs as a component of cell therapy procedures .
several studies have demonstrated that mscs possess an immunoregulatory function in vitro and in vivo and that this property suggests clinical applications in the regulation of immunocompetent cell responses   .
bm - derived mscs have an immunoregulatory capacity because they can regulate the function of multiple immune system components . to fulfill this role , mscs must be activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as ifn. mscs can inhibit dcs maturation and thus prevent the activation of t lymphocytes and even more and decrease the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of nk cells . as a result of these characteristics , mscs are a promising alternative treatment for immune - related diseases .
