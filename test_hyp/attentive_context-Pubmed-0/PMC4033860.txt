, i describe the case of a young female patient , who developed atypical signs of op poisoning following subcutaneous injection of dichlorvos .
, extensive muscle necrosis was reported following intramuscular injection of dichlorvos . in another case , following injection of dichlorvos subcutaneously in both wrists , a young patient developed compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy . in both cases
parenteral dichlorvos administration with suicidal intention is rarely reported in the literature . in one case report
dichlorvos ( dimethyl-2 , 2-dichloro vinyl phosphate ) is an organophosphorous ( op ) insecticide with moderate human toxicity , used for insect control in food storage areas , greenhouses , barns and control of insects on livestock .
the present case report is about a 37-year - old , previously healthy female , who was admitted to our intensive care unit 18-h after alleged self - injection of 76% dichlorvos ( nuvos ) 3 ml in the upper left arm ( 3 times with a 1 ml insulin syringe ) . within an hour of the injections
extrapyramidal signs of op poisoning are often transient and may be missed in a sick patient . in a taiwanese series
possible explanation for these atypical manifestations in our patient could be route specific ( in this case subcutaneous ) effect of op compound ( dichlorovos ) causing isolated delayed cns depression , with few peripheral cholinergic signs .
