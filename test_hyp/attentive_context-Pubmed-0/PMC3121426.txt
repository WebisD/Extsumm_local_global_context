consistent with the working hypothesis that a reduction of hypothalamic glial glut1 is responsible for the metabolic impairments induced by hyperglycemia , hyperglycemia suppresses bbb glucose transport in stz - induced rodents ( 17,18 ) , although glucose uptake into the glial cells was not determined .
the underlying mechanisms responsible for the deleterious effects of sustained hyperglycemia on glucose homeostasis remain unclear in both rodents and humans .
the current set of data demonstrated sustained hyperglycemia as seen in uncontrolled diabetes impairs cns glucose effectiveness to increase hypothalamic glucose concentration and lower glucose production through changes in hypothalamic glial glut1 .
we put forward a working hypothesis that in diabetes overexpressing hypothalamic glial glut1 enhances glucose uptake into glial cells and elevates intracellular glucose and lactate concentration in response to cns glucose sensing .
our data highlight the critical role of hypothalamic glial glut1 in mediating hypothalamic glucose sensing to regulate glucose production in vivo .
1d ) in stz - induced diabetic rats as compared with intrahypothalamic glucose in normal rats , which was effective in lowering glucose production ( fig .
together , the ability of glut1 to facilitate intracellular glucose uptake and regulate glucose metabolism plays an important role in certain disease progression , and changes in hypothalamic glial glut1 , as suggested by the current study , alter peripheral glucose regulation in diabetes .
