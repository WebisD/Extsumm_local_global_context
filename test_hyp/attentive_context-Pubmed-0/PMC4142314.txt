p2y12 expression in primary microglia is variable with postnatal development and shows sexually dimorphic behavior . through the use of all the available p2y12-immunoreactive antibodies recognizing the c - terminus or the second intracellular loop of the receptor , the aim of the present work is to provide comparative evidence about p2y12 cell specificity in microglia versus oligodendrocytes particularly from the healthy and diseased cns under neuroinflammatory conditions as those sustained during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) and multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .
by comparative analysis of all the available p2y12-immunoreactive antibodies recognizing the c - terminus or the second intracellular loop of the receptor , we have established here that , under experimental conditions of well - preserved cytoarchitecture and tissue integrity , p2y12 receptor expressed by both ramified microglia or oligodendrocytes / myelinated fibers might serve a dual function as specific marker , respectively , of branched / surveillant microglia as well as demyelinating lesions .
moreover , we previously established in vivo the expression of p2y12 in oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths of rat cerebral cortex , subcortical areas , and periventricular white matter . this localization is confirmed throughout the corticospinal tract , therefore suggesting high conserved tissue - homogeneity and phenotype - specificity , and a hypothesized role in myelination   .
