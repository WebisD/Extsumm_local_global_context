chelation of iron reverses iron - induced aggregation in 
  vivo  to investigate iron - mediated aggregation in vivo , we 
  used primary cultures of astrocytes from cerebral cortex of transgenic mice 
  expressing the mt - ftl polypeptide . in this mouse model , the human mt - ftl 
  polypeptide forms heteropolymers with the endogenous murine wild type ftl and 
  fth1 polypeptides , which are seen to aggregate in neurons and glia throughout 
  the life span of the mice 
  ( 29 ) .
, the mt - ftl polypeptide may act as a dominant 
  negative mutant , leading to a failure of ferritin in its iron storage function 
  and an increase in the levels of intracellular iron .
addition of 
  the lipophilic and freely cell - permeant iron chelator 1,10-phen to the 
  fac - treated cells ( fac / phen ) led to a large reduction in the signal for 
  detergent - insoluble ferritin and the reappearance of ferritin in the 
  detergent - soluble fraction ( fig . 
 
homopolymers of recombinant wt- 
  and mt - ftl polypeptides were able to incorporate iron in vivo in 
  preparations obtained from e. coli , suggesting that both are 
  functional proteins . in vitro ,
