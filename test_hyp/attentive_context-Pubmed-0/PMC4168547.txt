hemangiomatosis differs from multiple or giant hemangiomas in that the boundary of the lesion is ill - defined , while in the latter , the liver parenchyma surrounding the lesion is compressed by a fibrous capsule forming the wall of the hemangioma .
in conclusion , dhh with no associated cavernous hemangiomas and without extra - hepatic involvement is an extremely rare condition . despite its rarity
dr . alexandre batista liver hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors . diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis ( dhh ) is a rare disorder , usually occurring in the neonate , characterized by extensive replacement of liver parenchyma with hemangiomatous lesions .
, it can be suggested in adults presenting with multiple , predominantly sub - centimeter hepatic lesions demonstrating mri features of hemangiomas .
an asymptomatic 68-year - old man was referred to our hospital due to the presence of numerous nodular hepatic lesions accidentally detected on ultrasound .
dhh in the adult , especially without extra - hepatic involvement , is extremely rare .
it is frequently associated with a palpable abdominal mass and high - output heart failure , with high mortality rate in neonates .
mr imaging may be superior to us and computed tomography ( ct ) for the diagnosis and is the preferable cross - sectional imaging technique for long - term follow - up .
