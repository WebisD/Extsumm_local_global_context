the predisposing factors in developing endometriosis , as well as the interplay between the pathological mechanisms involved in the initiation and propagation of different endometriotic lesions , will be discussed .
may also be dependent on mobile , endometrial progenitor - type cells in these ectopic lesions that are involved in initiating further lesion and also in maintaining the disease . a dysfunctional immune clearance and
we initially searched  pubmed  for relevant literature using the terms  endometriosis  and  pathogenesis  or 
endometriosis is a chronic , benign , oestrogen - dependent inflammatory disease affecting approximately 10% of reproductive age women and 3550% of women with pelvic pain and infertility .
ectopically placed stem cells that are of endometrial or haematopoietic origin or abnormal endometrial differentiation of a resident tissue stem cell may be the first step in the establishment of an ectopic endometrial lesion . the subsequent proliferation and propagation of such lesions
neither medical nor surgical options provide long term or universally acceptable relief for patients . improving our current knowledge on the pathogenesis of endometriosis therefore helps the clinical and basic science researchers to identify novel more suitable targets for formulating more effective therapeutic and diagnostic means .
many theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of endometriosis and to date they all remain to be conclusively confirmed . in this review ,
