the scd technique , which decompress posteriorly by en - bloc total ligamentum flavectomy and preserve posterior facet , was clinically effective and does not lead to postoperative spinal instability .
the mean vas score of back pain decreased from 6.3 to 4.3 , and the mean vas score for lower leg radiating pain also decreased from 8.3 to 2.5 ( p < 0.01 ) . the average odi score ( maximum , 45 points ) improved significantly from 25.3 preoperatively to 10.3 postoperatively ( p < 0.01 ) .
we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 19 patients ( mean age , 67.9 years ; 2 men and 17 women ) who were treated using the scd method for a lumbar spinal stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis from 2010 to 2013 .
the mean vas score of back pain decreased from 6.3 to 4.3 , and the mean vas score for lower leg radiating pain also decreased from 8.3 to 2.5 ( p < 0.01 ) . the average odi score ( maximum , 45 points ) improved significantly from 25.3 preoperatively to 10.3 postoperatively ( p < 0.01 ) .
although a prospective randomized controlled clinical study is needed , our results showed that decompression surgery using the scd technique was effective and less invasive for patients with spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis . in conclusion ,
