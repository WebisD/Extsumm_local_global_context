as a part of a 5-year longitudinal study investigating the risk of respiratory illness associated with work in and around flood - damaged structures in post - hurricane katrina new orleans , baseline findings from initial cross - sectional survey are reported .
moderate adverse respiratory health effects including toxic pneumonitis and sinusitis were commonly reported in the study cohort , and the prevalence of new onset asthma among restoration workers was noticeably elevated . while it is unclear from this cross - sectional analysis whether restoration work exposures have adversely affected pulmonary function in the population , the functional parameters overall are depressed in the cohort .
ongoing longitudinal health surveillance of this study cohort , along with a quantitative exposure assessment , will examine whether there is an increased risk for long - term or irreversible effects on respiratory health and how the risks relate to the nature and magnitude of the exposures occurring during posthurricane flood restoration work .
the prevalence rate ratios for post - hurricane katrina new onset asthma were elevated for the overall cohort ( prr = 2.2 ) and especially for ex- and never smokers ( prr = 2.7 ) but were not statistically significant ( p = 0.09 ) ; the overall lack of significance may have been due in part to the low incidence ( 29 cases ) and the reduced size of the base population ; that is , only those who never had asthma prior to hurricane katrina .
