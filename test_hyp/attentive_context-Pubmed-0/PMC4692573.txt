our article presents the usefulness of echocardiography in the early diagnosis of ph in dialysis patients , based on our own clinical experience .
if ph was diagnosed in a patient treated with hd , it facilitates a decision to change the treatment modality to peritoneal dialysis or qualification for earlier kidney transplantation .
the achievements of contemporary echocardiography , especially the introduction of measurement of tapse in the early diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a population of patients with chronic kidney disease , particularly esrd requiring dialysis , showed a significant diagnostic and prognostic value of this simple test . in patients with esrd at risk of developing pulmonary hypertension
thanks to technological progress , in the last 30 years there has been a significant increase in the number of patients with esrd ( end - stage renal disease ) undergoing renal replacement therapy . despite this progress , recent statistics show that technological advancement does not translate into reduced mortality or morbidity in chronic dialysis patients
this data indicates the need for early identification of classic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure with arrhythmic complications , as recognized predictors of fatal prognosis in dialysis patients with esrd . in recent years , substantial attention was paid to the development of pulmonary hypertension ( ph ) , as another strong risk factor for adverse outcomes in a population of patients on both hemodialysis ( hd ) and peritoneal dialysis program ( pd ) .
