the women with pe showed significantly higher serum concentrations of tnf- and il-15 ( p values : 0.001 and 0.01 respectively ) relative to the control group . in comparison ,
consequently , upraised levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines in our study may be the perquisite of pe .
, we compared the serum levels of tnf- , il-15 , and il-10 in iranian pe women with normotensive ones .
levels of il-10 in the serum of normotensive pregnant women were significantly higher than pe patients ( p value = 0.01 ) .
results of this study demonstrated that in women having pe , compared to women with a normal pregnancy , inflammatory th1-type responses are increased ; while anti - inflammatory responses are decreased .
there was no statistically significant difference related to age and gestational age at the time of sampling between two groups ; however , there were higher systolic and diastolic pressures in pe group compared to normotensive one ( p values : 0.01 and 0.03 respectively for systolic and diastolic blood pressures ) .
the higher levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( tnf- and il-15 ) and lower levels of il-10 in the pe group suggest an increased inflammatory status in pe during last months .
