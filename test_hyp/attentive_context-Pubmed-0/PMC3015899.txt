while we recognize that both the american college of obstetrics and gynecology and a recent cochrane analysis clearly state that tah is more beneficial than lsh in treating benign gynecologic conditions , clinicians should strongly consider the several encouraging lsh findings and emerging studies that continue to substantiate the efficacy of lsh for treating many common benign gynecologic conditions .
laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy ( lsh ) has continued to represent a favorable alternative to total abdominal hysterectomy ( tah ) for the treatment of benign gynecologic conditions , particularly due to the reduced complication rates , shorter surgery / hospital stay , and prompt resumption of patient daily living activities .
the purpose of this commentary is to address the primary objections against lsh and further illustrate the benefits inherent in this procedure . initially , the primary impetus for removal of the cervix at the time of hysterectomy in patients with benign conditions was to prevent cervical cancer . however , the incidence of cancer in the cervical stump is extremely low and primarily preventable due to latent disease progression , pap smear technology , and hpv screening .
we suspect that the controversy surrounding the removal of the cervix is partially attributed to both insufficient lsh outcome studies and because many gynecologic surgeons are not formerly trained or experienced with this treatment option .
