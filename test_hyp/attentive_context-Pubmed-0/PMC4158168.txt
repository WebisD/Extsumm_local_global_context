the suppression of metformin in a collagen - induced arthritis ( cia ) mouse model was demonstrated by focusing on the suppression of th17 differentiation and enhancing treg differentiation .
the present study demonstrated that metformin had an anti - inflammatory effect on cia due to the inhibition of th17 cell differentiation and the upregulation of treg cell differentiation along with the suppression of osteoclast differentiation .
in the present study , we demonstrated that metformin suppressed cia via reciprocal regulation of th17 cell and treg cell .
metformin - activated ampk seems to be involved in this regulation through the inhibition of mtor and its downstream molecules , hif-1 and stat3 .
these regulatory effects of ampk on th17 cells and osteoclasts have prompted the investigation on the effect of the ampk agonist , metformin , on autoimmune arthritis . in the present study ,
the effect of metformin on joint destruction and regulation of immune cells in occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated .
our data suggest that metformin might be a potential candidate for therapeutic modulation of experimental animal model with rheumatoid arthritis .
the mrna expression of the osteoclast - related markers , trap , cathepsin k , mmp-9 , calcitonin receptor , carbonic ii , and integrin 3 , decreased by meformin treatment .
