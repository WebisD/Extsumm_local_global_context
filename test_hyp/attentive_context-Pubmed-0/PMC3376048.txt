the majority of experiments in animal cognition , in both the physical and social domain , present animals with specific problems and investigate how the animals solve them in order to examine specific cognitive abilities / processes .
benchmark tests for examining the existence of certain cognitive abilities in different species , e.g. , the  trap - tube for examining an understanding of causality in terms of surface continuity , povinelli s cane task and heinrich s  string - pulling task for testing responsiveness to connectivity etc .
apart from the correlation studies mentioned above , the ability to innovate and solve novel problems flexibly , proxies for flexible cognitive capacities and potentially for domain - general intelligence , have not been investigated comparatively .
it highlights in particular , what major impact differences in object exploration ( haptic or visual exploration mode ) and affordance learning , which have only recently become a topic in animal cognition , can have on performance in artificial experimental tasks , and hence how this affects the comparability of two species in the same task . in future comparative research , establishing behavioral and psychological profiles of the species to be compared ought to precede comparative tests of specific cognitive skills or general intelligence .
