, our study indicates that mbl2 variants are more likely to influence type 2 diabetes via an effect on insulin secretion rather than on insulin action , suggesting that inflammatory damage in pancreatic -cell function may be involved .
consistent with the latter effect , high mbl levels have been associated with increased risk for insulin resistance in pregnancy ( 31 ) and late - onset of rheumatoid arthritis ( 5 ) . however
for both rs11003125 and rs1800450 , the allele associated with higher risk for diabetes ( g and glycine , respectively ) was associated with a higher 2-h plasma glucose concentration ( adjusted p = 0.0005 and 0.04 , respectively ) and higher 2-h plasma insulin concentration ( adjusted p = 0.0008 and 0.003 , respectively ) during an oral glucose tolerance test ( table 3 ) .
plasma insulin concentrations ( fasting , 2 h , and 30 min ) , rates of glucose disappearance during the low - dose insulin stimulation , and the acute insulin response were log transformed before analyses to approximate a normal distribution . the p value for percent body fat
consistent with the native american samples , rs11003125 was associated with type 2 diabetes in the amish ( or 1.51 ; p = 0.004 , adjusted for age , sex , and family structure ) ( table 2 ) , but the frequency of risk allele g was lower in the amish than in pima indians ( 0.45 vs. 0.77 , respectively ) .
