to date only two species , mangrovibacter plantisponsor dsm 19579   and mangrovibacter yixingensis kctc 42181   have been described under the genus mangrovibacter ( http://www.bacterio.net/mangrovibacter.html ) . the draft genome of mangrovibacter sp . strain mfb070 , isolated from an aquaculture farm in india has been described recently   which is the only available genome sequence within genus mangrovibacter .
the genome of mangrovibacter sp . strain mp23 was sequenced by a shotgun sequencing method using the illumina miseq sequencing system with a paired - end module .
p. karka is a large perennial grass of the family poaceae and occupy most of the northern shoreline of lagoon . in order to understand the microbial basis of the invasive success of this weed
the genome contained a total of 4592 genes and 4392 protein - coding genes with predicted function .
, a study was undertaken to investigate the culturable diversity of rhizosphere microbiota associated with p. karka . during this study , a gamma - proteobacterium , facultative anaerobic , endophytic nitrogen fixing mangrovibacter sp .
members of the genus mangrovibacter have been shown to possess plant growth promoting features such as nitrogen fixation   and may provide niche - specific advantage to the plant . in context to invasive weeds , this could provide a better ecological fitness in an invaded territory compared to native vegetation .
