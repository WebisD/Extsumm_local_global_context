proliferation of pbmc stimulated with imod and pha was used to investigate t cells proliferation of all dogs enrolled in the study . at the end of study ( day 60 ) ,
therefore , it is important to confirm this assumption by more studies with more animals in each studied groups and longer follow - up period whether imod monotherapy or combination therapy represent reasonable effects in leishmaniasis prevention and/or treatment as a model for improving cell - mediated immunity in a immunocompromised animal or human .
protective and therapeutic responses in dogs have been related with the remission of clinical symptoms , low levels of anti - leishmania antibodies and reduce the parasite load ( 4 , 28 ) . in this study , although imod administration was not associated with clinical adverse effects and the evaluation of renal and hepatic functions revealed no remarkable changes , signs of clinical remission were not detected in treatment group .
the safety of imod has already been approved by in vitro and in vivo studies ( 20 , 21 ) . due to increasing understanding of immunological mechanisms involved in leishmania infection control , studies on anti - leishmania agents have advanced in recent years ( 22 ) . on the other hand , more awareness in cvl will help open new concepts for treating infected dogs and develop new medical protocol for human leishmaniasis ( 22 , 23 ) . therefore in this preliminary investigation
