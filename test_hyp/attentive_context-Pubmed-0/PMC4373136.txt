in addition , the surface and upper air temperature anomalies , computed here from area - average temperatures , play an important role during the largest melt years such that temperature anomalies have to reach almost 2 standard deviations to result in a melt area above 40% as happened in 2002 and 2012 . in the case of summer 2007
2013 ] , and here we show , using modis and atmospheric reanalysis ( ncep / ncar ) data , that the relationship holds also on a daily time scale . our analysis of all 14 melt seasons ( 20002013 ) shows that blocking that occurs in a range of time scales , from short - term blocking activity ( < 5 days ) ( libs ) to full - fledged gbes ( blocking for 5 days or longer ) , can bring warm subtropical air masses over the gis to instigate melt . despite the overall close relationship between gbes / libs and ice sheet melt , not all blocking activity leads to melt as exemplified in the summer 2007 which had the most june - july blocking days during the period 20002013 .
previously studies have shown that blocking can be associated with increased greenland ice sheet melt on seasonal time scales [ e.g. , fettweis et al . ,
