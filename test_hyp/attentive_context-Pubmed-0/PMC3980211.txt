in fact , comparisons of these data may help to shed light on topics which are still debated , such as : the relationship between chromosome territories and the interchromatin space within the interphase cell nucleus ; the structure of chromatin fibres ( i.e. , whether with a diameter of 10 or 30 nm ) ; the structure of transcriptionally - active and inactive chromatin . a brief description of the characteristics of the feulgen - like technique for the visualization of dna - containing structures at the electron microscope level and its potential for studying both gross and fine chromatin structure in situ will be discussed first .
this staining procedure , introduced by cogliati and gautier , contributed to electron microscopy by exclusively visualizing the dna - containing structures , thus allowing a study of the chromatin organization down to the molecular level in thin sections of samples fixed in situ .
the ultrastructural studies conducted in situ at the electron microscope level using the feulgen - like osmium - ammine reaction for the selective staining of dna have helped to define the structural - functional organization of interphase and metaphase chromatin in mammalian cells .
this demonstrated high plasticity of chromatin is consistent both with the chromosome territory - interchromatin model and with the interchromatin network model : the nuclear architecture model depending upon the transcriptional activity of the cell .
