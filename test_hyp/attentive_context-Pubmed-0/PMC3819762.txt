the specific goals for the current study were to further explore the potential utility of the fqol construct in guiding dementia care , and to gain insight regarding the following questions related to fqol.who do dementia patients consider to be family?do family members report ways that dementia affects their fqol?what are the common fqol - related needs that families identify in a healthcare setting ? 
  who do dementia patients consider to be family ?
alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) and related dementias affect an individuals ' quality of life ( qol ) in profound ways .
what are the common fqol - related needs that families identify in a healthcare setting ?
the final question the study sought to assess was what broader needs patients and families commonly identified in a dementia - specialty healthcare setting .
the second study question investigated how families report the effects of dementia on domains associated with fqol .
this supports the potential usefulness of assessing fqol in community - dwelling people with dementia instead of the more typical separate patient and single - caregiver measures of individual qol . on many questionnaires , issues related to the dynamics of family - based care emerged ( e.g. ,  very difficult to communicate with my family , and this is depressing to us all  ) indicating that solely inquiring about individual qol from a caregiver or patient perspective alone fails to assess important dynamics within a family unit .
