we report on two families with familial clustering of mm , we review the literature on familial mm , and we discuss the options for screening healthy relatives for mm in these familial cases .
- more than one first - degree relative diagnosed with multiple myeloma , or - one first - degree and at least one second - degree relative with multiple myeloma annual protein electrophoresis to test immunoglobulins in blood and urine , starting at age 40 years .
multiple myeloma ( mm ) is a haematological malignancy characterised by a malignant proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow producing monoclonal immunoglobulins and by the formation of focal osteolytic lesions in the skeleton .
the disorder might evolve from a common pre - malignant condition called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( mgus ) .
family 1 had three first - degree relatives affected by mm ( figure 1 ) . the index patient ( iii-2 ) was a 65-year old female who was diagnosed with mm after presenting with pain in the shoulder region and fatigue .
two unrelated families were referred to our clinic asking about the possible heritability of mm in their family and the options for screening of healthy relatives .
