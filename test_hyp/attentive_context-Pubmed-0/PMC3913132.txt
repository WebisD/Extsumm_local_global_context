, there was a clinical suspicion of ebv - induced hlh and the patient was given the option of treatment with rituximab .
the epstein  barr virus ( ebv ) infects b cells . in most cases , ebv - positive patients develop a severe form of infectious mononucleosis which typically manifests with fever , tonsillopharyngitis , lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly .
we describe here a patient who developed hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia at 2 years of age but achieved automatic recovery .
severe infection of ebv is not associated with life - threatening condition , but our case study needs urgent treatment . in patients with long - term ebv infection , pancytopenia , coagulopathy and hepatosplenomegaly ,
thus , the main aim of treatment is to reduce the rate of mortality in patients with hlh .
although ebv - associated hlh carries a high mortality rate , quick diagnosis and appropriate treatment can subside the disease .
deficiencies may be characterized by abnormal activity of lymphocyte function leading to hemophagocytosis and multi - organ failure .
the primary form is an inflammatory disease which is similar to secondary one on the basis of symptoms .
based on clinical symptoms and lab tests ( table 1 ) , bma was performed once again and the result raised suspicion of ebv - induced secondary hlh .
