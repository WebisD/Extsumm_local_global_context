thus , the aim of this review is to summarize what is already established regarding the role of il-33 in the gi tract , while providing insight into the potential role of this novel il-1 family member in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation .
in particular , ibd , namely , crohn 's disease ( cd ) and ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , is characterized by a significant dysregulation of cytokine production , with , in general , an overabundance of proinflammatory mediators . for example , it has been shown that in the inflamed mucosa of ibd patients and colitis models , there is a perturbation of the balance between the proinflammatory cytokine , il-1 , and its naturally occurring antagonist , the il-1 receptor antagonist ( il-1ra ) , and that restoring this balance by exogenous administration of il-1ra ameliorates intestinal inflammation   .
however , controversy still exists as to its precise role in intestinal disorders , particularly in the development of ibd .
in fact , a broad wealth of evidence demonstrates the importance of cytokine dysregulation in the onset of inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract .
the intestinal epithelium is the largest surface area of the human body in direct contact with the external environment and exposed to a multitude of foreign microorganisms , macromolecules , and xenobiotics . as such
