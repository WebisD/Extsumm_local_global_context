the aim of the current study was to investigate whether the comparable expression of gaba a subunits can be observed in pbmcs from chronic hepatitis c ( chc ) patients that have undergone anti - hcv treatment .
future studies should elucidate whether the alteration of gaba a expression , which is observed during chc infection , has an impact on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma .
, it was previously demonstrated that the drug - dependent inhibition of gaba a receptors expression does not alter hcv load , which may suggest that , rather , hcv infection is responsible for inducing such changes in gaba a expression that favor hcv propagation in target cells . in conclusion , the current study provides evidence for the 1 and 3 expression in pbmcs from hcv - infected patients . decreased gaba a 3 expression , which is observed in hcv rna - positive pbmcs ,
our results showed , for the first time , that the expression of the 1 and 3 subunits of the gaba a receptor is common not only for healthy donors ( 15 ) , but also for anti - hcv - treated patients .
our study was designed to evaluate whether the expression of chosen subunits of gaba a receptors in pbmcs bears any relation to hcv infection and/or the path of hcv rna elimination after anti - viral treatment .
