this study demonstrated that administrative claims data provide an accurate basis for the diagnosis of pneumonia in copd patients across multiple service settings .
the objective was to confirm the accuracy of claims - based diagnoses of pneumonia by using the physicians diagnoses ( medical record - based ) as the reference standard .
additional research will help to validate whether the service setting has a bearing on the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis and whether differences were a consequence of data type or the actual content of the data inherent in claims and medical records . with the increasing amount of research
claims that were linked to paper charts had the same ppv as the overall study population , 80.2% ( 95% ci : 71.1%87.5% ) , while those linked to electronic medical records ( emr ) had a lower ppv , 73.3% ( 95% ci : 65.5%80.2% ) , and those with data from both paper charts and emr had a higher ppv , 87.6% ( 95% ci : 80.9%92.6% ) .
patients whose records were abstracted ( n=388 ) and pneumonia patients identified with claims data ( n=1,345 ) had similar mean age ( 67.8 and 67.4 years ) , sex ( 53.9% and 52.9% female ) , and health plan type ( 60.3% and 60.6% , enrolled in preferred provider organizations ) , respectively
