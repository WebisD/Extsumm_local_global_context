the cytokine profiles of mpn patients involving deregulation of proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines as well as growth factors suggest that the impact of these deregulations is involved in hematological but also extra - hematological manifestations of these pathologies .
these deregulations confirm the existence of an inflammatory reaction in mpns that may contribute to the initiation and progression of the disease . in this context
the significant reduction of cytokines by mechanisms of inhibition of jak2 , and most likely jak1 , could serve as an indirect marker for evaluation of therapeutic compliance in case of absence or inadequate therapeutic response .
recently , clinical trials with janus kinase ( jak ) inhibitors have confirmed the presence of aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines and highlighted their role in the pathophysiology of philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( ph mpns ) .
long - term treatment with jak2 inhibitors may also raise the question of patient compliance with their treatment . as a result ,
the knowledge of cytokine function has not only contributed to the development of supportive therapies ( i.e. , erythropoietin ( epo ) ) , but dysregulation of cytokines also argues in the diagnosis of some hematopoietic disorders . for example , one of the minor criteria of polycythemia vera ( pv ) according to who 2008 classification is the subnormal serum epo level .
