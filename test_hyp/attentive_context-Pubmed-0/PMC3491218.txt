have revolutionized the methods and results of endovascular treatment.14)22 ) combining a self expanding stent with a " cross - over technique " , which uses an inter - arterial communication as an access route to the other vascular part,9)12 ) the authors herein report on a bilateral approach for stent - assisted coiling of two complex pica origin aneurysms .
aneurysms at the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( pica ) remain a challenge for neurosurgeons because the close proximity to the brainstem and lower cranial nerves poses a high risk for surgical clipping.1)14)15 ) aside from such anatomic unchangeability of adjacent structures , complex anatomic features of pica origin aneurysms themselves also add high risks for both surgical and endovascular treatments.16)19 ) however , in the past decade , there have been substantial advances in device technologies and endovascular techniques . as a result , the number of patients who are not candidates for endovascular treatment is decreasing . in particular , the " self expanding stent technology " and " supercompliant balloon technology "
due to recent instrumental and technical developments leading to good results , endovascular treatment is considered the primary treatment for posterior circulation aneurysms . however , complex pica aneurysms , having a wide neck and pica incorporation , remain a challenge for both surgical and endovascular treatments . in such cases , a bilateral approach for
