the authors performed a multi - dimensional analysis using rat gene expression and human genetic association that identified a new genetic factor affecting susceptibility to chronic pain .
costigan and colleagues   therefore examined snp alleles within the human homolog ( kcns1 ) in five independent cohorts ( two with chronic low back pain , two after limb amputation and one after mastectomy ) that have a high incidence of chronic pain . in four of
other studies have successfully identified a human genetic susceptibility factor on the basis of a candidate gene emerging from analysis of a rodent model .
a genetic risk factor could have a substantial impact on clinical practice because individuals at increased risk for developing a chronic pain syndrome could be identified before a surgical procedure or immediately after a traumatic incident . the genetic information could be used to develop proactive methods for prevention of chronic pain syndromes , enabling interventions to be targeted to the high - risk subset . because of the great inter - individual variation in the response to painful stimuli and to analgesic drugs , knowledge of genetic risk factors could enable better stratification of chronic pain patients or aid in the selection of the appropriate therapy . rather than focusing on the disease that is etiologically associated with the chronic pain ,
