the aim of this study was to determine whether topiramate induces regeneration of small cutaneous nerve fibers in concert with improved skbf and sensory measures of c - fiber function .
quantification of ienf density and mean dendritic length in skin biopsies , carried out at entry into the study and repeated at the same sites after 18 weeks of treatment , showed an increase in nerve fiber length at the forearm and proximal leg after treatment with topiramate , and an increase in nerve fiber density at the proximal leg .
in this small within - subject pilot study , we have shown that 18 weeks of treatment with topiramate induced improvement in neurologic disability scores , including prickling , vibration , and touch perception .
we have previously shown4,44 that the earliest change found in patients with the metabolic syndrome without hyperglycemia is a reduction in mean dendritic length and that the decrease in ienf density occurs after at least five years of diabetes and is most prominent at the distal site.44 thus , the patients in this study most closely resemble those with diabetes , including those with features of the current definition of the metabolic syndrome ( table 1 ) .
