. therefore , we investigated whether the lep gene g2548a polymorphism and lepr gene 668a / g ( q223r ) polymorphism might be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity .
our findings indicate that the lep g2548a polymorphism is not a relevant obesity marker and that the lepr 668a / g polymorphism may be related to obesity in a turkish population . additionally , the lep / lepr gg / gg combined genotype was found to increase the risk of obesity in patients compared to controls
we found no statistically significant difference in the genotype frequencies of the lep gene polymorphism in patients and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
allele frequencies in the lepr gene showed no statistically significant association ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . the lepr gene a allele was 61.4% in patients and 69.5% in the control group , while the g allele frequency was 38.5% in patients and 30.4% in the control group . in the combined analysis of the lep and lepr genes ,
the lep / lepr gg / gg combined genotype was found to increase the risk of obesity compared to the controls ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 4 ) . in the combined genotype analysis based on the mean bmi of obesity patients
