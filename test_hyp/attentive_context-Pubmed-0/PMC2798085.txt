this paper addresses each characteristic factor of sids that must be explained : the gender distribution ; the age distribution ; the effect of prone and supine sleep positions ; the seasonal variation ; risk factors of anemic apnea , respiratory infection , and neurological prematurity , and links them together with other causes of respiratory deaths as a proposed unifying theory .
three inter - related causal spheres of influence model  in which any two of these three could cause sids : ( 1 ) subclinical tissue damage ( 2 ) deficiency in postnatal development of reflexes and responses , and ( 3 ) environmental factors .  
proof of this unifying mechanism must await genetic testing to identify , if correct , the unknown recessive x - linked allele that is exclusively present in all these icd codes with the statistically similar male excess of sids .
we reason that all those different causes of death lead to the same cerebral anoxia that may result in respiratory failure from the absence of an x - linked dominant allele that supports anaerobic oxidation in respiratory control neurons of the brainstem .
filiano and kinney   also proposed a  triple risk model  but required three risk factors , similar to emery 's , to act simultaneously and described them as ( 1 ) vulnerable infant ; ( 2 ) critical development period ; and ( 3 ) environmental stressors .
