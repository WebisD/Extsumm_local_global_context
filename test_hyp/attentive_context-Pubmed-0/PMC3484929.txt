experimental data support the feasibility to implant a te heart valve , based on a decellularized scaffold , into the systemic circulation .
mechanical heart valves have extended durability , but permanent anticoagulation is mandatory . therefore a new generation heart valve is needed to overcome these limitations , showing the advantages of a healthy viable tissue valve with remodelling , regeneration and growth potential . a concept to create a patient specific viable aortic heart valve
several suitable prostheses are available to replace the aortic valve , with specific advantages and disadvantages .  
biological heart valves , of either allogenic or xenogenic origin , show excellent hemodynamic behavior and low risk of thromboembolic complications , but their use is limited due to tissue deterioration .
can be performed with tissue engineering ( te ) techniques , in which three essential components are included .
the important difference between aortic valves and pulmonary valves is the discrepancy between the thickness of the aortic wall and the pulmonary valve in relation with the leaflet of the valves .  
since this is a demanding surgical procedure , with a high mortality rate , there were several implantation techniques performed .  
. some of these valves can be reconstructed ; however this is not always feasible due to tissue degeneration and therefore replacement is needed .
