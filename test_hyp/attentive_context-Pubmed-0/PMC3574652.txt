our purpose is to investigate through a research of the recent literature the effect of the angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) administered in the acute phase of stroke on death and dependency .
the currently available studies did not identify any clear indication that treatment with the arbs is beneficial in patients with acute stroke and raised bp on functional outcome and stroke recurrence at short and medium term .
the analysis of the first co - primary effect variable , the cumulative risk of the composite endpoint of vascular death , stroke or myocardial infarction , showed no significant difference between candesartan and placebo ( unadjusted analysis hr 1.09 , 95% ci 0.841.41 ; p = 0.53 ; adjusted analysis hr 1.09 , 0.841.41 ; p = 0.52 ; per - protocol analysis hr 1.11 , 0.851.46 ; p = 0.46 ) . regarding the second co - primary effect variable , the functional outcome at 6 months , no significant difference was seen across the mrs categories ( unadjusted ordinal regression analysis , or 1.13 , 95% ci 0.971.32 ; p = 0.12 ) ; similar results have been obtained in both the fixed dichotomy ( mrs 36 versus 02 ) analysis ( unfavourable outcomes in 35% of patients on candesartan and in 33% of patients allocated on placebo ; or 1.12 , 0.901.41 , p = 0.32 ; rr 1.06 , 0.931.19 , p = 0.39 ) and the sliding dichotomy analysis using the sss scores at baseline ( unfavourable outcomes in 56% of patients on candesartan and 52% of patients on placebo ; or 1.16 , 95% ci 0.971.38 , p = 0.11 ; rr 1.07 , 95% ci 0.991.16 , p = 0.11 ) .
