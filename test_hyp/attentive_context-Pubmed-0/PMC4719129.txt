the other aims were to assess the effect of ptx on the serum levels of alt , ast , tnf- , il-8 , and il-6 in patients with nash .
patients with nash had significantly higher serum levels of il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- , as compared to healthy individuals , which confirmed the important role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of nash ( 11 , 12 ) . in the present study ,
the serum levels of il-6 , il-8 , and tnf- , as mean  sd , in healthy controls , were 6.3  3.9 , 18.0  7.5 , and 16.8  11.3 pg / ml , respectively . levels of these cytokines were significantly higher in patients with nash , compared with healthy controls .
the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ptx for 6 months , in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial , in patients with nash , in the city of kerman , in south - eastern iran .
hence , we suggest that a further randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial should be performed , with the enrolment of more patients with nash from different races , to confirm the effect of ptx on liver aminotransferases , histological findings , and inflammatory cytokines , in patients with nash .
