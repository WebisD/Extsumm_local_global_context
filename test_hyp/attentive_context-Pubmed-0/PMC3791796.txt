additionally , catheterization profile data between diastolic and nondiastolic dysfunctions did not reveal any statistically significant variables between the two groups , including systolic pulmonary artery pressures ( spap ) ( p = 0.77 ) , diastolic pulmonary artery pressures ( dpap ) ( p = 0.68 ) , mean pulmonary artery pressures ( mpap ) ( p = 0.84 ) , mean pcwp ( p = 0.17 ) , cardiac output ( p = 0.23 ) , cardiac index ( p = 0.21 ) , and left ventricular ejection fraction ( p = 0.99 ) ( table 3 ) .
pulmonary artery pressures were elevated and statistically significant in the pulmonary artery hypertension group in comparison with other groups . additionally , mean pcwp was statistically lower in the chronic obstruction pulmonary disease group when compared to other groups ( p = 0.05 ) .
mildly and moderately / severely elevated pretransplant pcwps were not associated with adverse clinical events posttransplant ( p = 0.30 ) ( figure 3 ) .
catheterization data was reviewed and based upon this information , 20 ( 19.8% ) patients were categorized into mildly elevated pcwp ( 1620  mmhg ) and 9 ( 8.9% ) patients with moderate / severely elevated pcwp ( > 20  mmhg ) ( table 2 ) .
