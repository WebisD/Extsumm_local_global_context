we assessed 
 the blood and brain pharmacokinetics of this new speciation of lithium 
 in rats and their therapeutic activities at several established targets 
 of lithium therapy .
we herein describe the synthesis of two novel iccs of organic anion 
 salts of lithium with the amino acid coformer , proline .
in regard to the therapeutic activity of 
 various lithium salts 
 for the treatment of bipolar disorder , equivalence is often assumed 
 because the lithium cation is regarded as the api .
our bioactivity 
 assessments of a new lithium icc compared to the parent lithium salt 
 supports this assumption only for the clinically relevant end points 
 that we evaluated in vitro .
importantly , because 
 the molecular ideology of bipolar disorder is not fully understood , 
 we can not conclude that various forms of lithium will be equally effective 
 at treating bipolar disorder in vivo .
we found that a 4 meq / kg dose of lispro to rats provided 
 consistently elevated levels of lithium in the plasma and brain out 
 to 48 h. conversely , li2co3 was almost undetectable 
 at 48 h in the plasma and produced a large spike in the plasma and 
 brain at 24 h post dose
