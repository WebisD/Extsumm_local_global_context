this is the first report of the imaging findings of lam involvement of female pelvic organs .
lam involvement of the uterus is extremely rare and there have been only a few such reported cases ( 2 - 7 ) , and the imaging findings of uterine lam have only been briefly mentioned in two reports ( 2 , 5 ) . in this article , we report the cross - sectional imaging findings of extensive lam involving the uterus and pelvic cavity in a 29-year - old woman with tuberous sclerosis complex ( tsc ) and we propose that certain imaging features and the clinical history may suggest the diagnosis . to the best of our knowledge ,
although uterine lam is rare , radiologists should consider the possibility of this disease when they see multiple cystic uterine or parauterine masses with or without internal hemorrhage in a patient with a history of tsc or pulmonary lam .
lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( lam ) is a rare idiopathic disease that exclusively occurs in women of childbearing age , and this disease is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells in the lungs and along the thoracic and abdominal lymphatics ( 1 - 3 ) .
