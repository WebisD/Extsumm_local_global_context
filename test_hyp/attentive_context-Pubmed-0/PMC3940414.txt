a preliminary in vivo characterization of 
 the identified irreversible faah inhibitors confirmed their ability 
 to raise endogenous brain levels of the enzyme substrates , including 
 anandamide , in mice to a greater extent ( > 2-fold ) and for a longer 
 duration ( > 6 h ) than the reversible -ketoheterocycles on 
 which 
 they are based .
the design , synthesis , and characterization 
 of -ketoheterocycles 
 that additionally target the remote cys269 nucleophile found in the 
 cytosolic port of faah provided inhibitors 
 that slowly react with the enzyme nucleophile , effectively providing 
 time - dependent , irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme that maintain 
 or enhance their selectivity for faah over other serine hydrolases . 

the electrophiles capable of targeting cys269 were incorporated as 
 a c5 substituent on the pyridyl group of the 5-(pyrid-2-yl ) oxazole 
 of 2 and ranged from the reactive benzylic bromide 11 to the otherwise benign nitrile 14 .
two of these ( 11 and 14 ) 
 were characterized in greater detail , as reported elsewhere , along 
 with their long acting in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of neuropathic 
 pain .
, this could be expected to enhance their 
 potency , potentially enhance their selectivity , and extend their in 
 vivo duration of action ( figure 2 ) .
