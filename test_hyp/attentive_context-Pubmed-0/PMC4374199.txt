currarino syndrome ( cs ) is a hereditary pathology that is characterized by a triad of malformations : sacrococcygeal bone defect , presacral mass , and anorectal malformation .
radiologic imaging modalities such as ultrasonography ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) play a vital part in diagnosis and follow - up of this pathology . in this report , we aim to present the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings of a case with complete cs recognized in adulthood .
a 20-year - old male patient who underwent anal atresia operation in childhood was referred to our department for evaluation of anal sphincter status with transrectal us .
20-year - old man with anal atresia operation history in childhood diagnosed with currarino syndrome .
mri may be used safely in diagnosis of the syndrome , in detecting the accompanying mass lesions and other pathologies , and in the follow - up investigations after treatment in patients with cs .
currarino syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that is characterized by sacrococcygeal bone defect , presacral mass , and anorectal malformation .
cs should be obviously considered in patients with sacrococcygeal bone defect , presacral mass , and anorectal malformation .
