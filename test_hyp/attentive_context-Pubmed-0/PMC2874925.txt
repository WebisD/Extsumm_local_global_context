as summarized above , the discoveries of recent years provided a significant body of evidence confirming an important role of sympathetic neurotransmitters and , consequently , chronic stress in regulating of tumor vascularization ( figure 1 ) .
this research opens new avenues for developing novel therapeutics , as well as using already existing and well - characterized drugs , such as -blockers and da receptor agonists , in new clinical settings .
stressful events activate the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis , which lead to the release of biochemical mediators of stress , such as cortisol , catecholamines , and neuropeptides   .
thus , stress mediators and their receptors can become novel targets in antiangiogenic tumor therapy .
when stress becomes chronic , the prolonged exposure to the same stress mediators , which were beneficial in acute stress , often triggers pathological processes and contributes to the development or exacerbation of various diseases , including cancer .  
chronic stress has been implicated in the stimulation of tumor development and progression by both clinical and animal studies   .
in contrast , their actions on tumor vascularization involve interactions with common angiogenic factors , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , and seem to be universal between different tumor types   .
