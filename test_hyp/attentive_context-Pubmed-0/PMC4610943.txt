a 24-year - old lady was referred to our pain clinic with complaint of abdominal pain for last 3 months .
this approach may serve as an alternative , safe , effective and reliable method to blind injection or in patients with severe pain and tenderness for probe placement at rectus sheath area .
complete pain relief to a diagnostic nerve block with local anaesthetic usually establishes the diagnosis . in literature
the purpose of above communication is to have high index of suspicion for acnes as the cause of abdominal wall pain and application of ultrasound guided tap block for the treatment of this pain .
history , proper physical examination and a positive carnett test in the absence of any other intra - abdominal pathology should raise the suspicion of acnes .
we did not go for the classic description of the tap block , in stead injected the anaesthetic in the transversus abdominis plane closer to the rectus muscle , so that the drug is deposited very near to the entrapped site . despite the increasing use of tap block for perioperative analgesia for hysterectomy , cesarean section , laparoscopic surgeries , there is very sparse literature on chronic pain application .
