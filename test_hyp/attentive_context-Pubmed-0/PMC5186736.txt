this study was conducted to verify the molecular variation of iranian p. sergenti populations , and to compare them with available data in genbank .
similar to the sequences of mtdna coi gene , its2 sequences could not resolve p. sergenti from p. similis and did not support the possible existence of sibling species or subspecies within p. sergenti s.l .. more molecular studies on other genes or hybridization should be done to clarify the status of different morphotypes of mentioned species in iran .
moreover , with regard to the importance of the epidemiology of leishmaniasis , further studies need to be performed on the possible role of these three morphotypes in the transmission of l. tropica .
these lineages were so - called sw , ne , ncs lineages which included haplotypes of south - west , north - east and a mix of haplotypes extended from northwest to the central to the southeast of the country , respectively .
phylogenetic sequence analysis revealed that most iranian haplotypes were associated with the northeastern mediterranean populations .
variations between the iranian specimens were due to two single nucleotide insertions / deletions ( indels ) and one variable repeats of a poly ( at ) microsatellite .
