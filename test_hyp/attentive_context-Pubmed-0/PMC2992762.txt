although the change in serum omentin-1 levels were significantly negatively associated with changes in whr , glucose , homa - ir , and hs - crp , only the change of hs - crp was significantly negatively correlated with the change of serum omentin-1 levels when subjected to multiple regression analysis .
also , serum omentin-1 levels were significantly negatively correlated with bmi , whr , glucose , homa - ir , and hs - crp .
finally , given that pcos is a proinflammatory state associated with clustering of cardiovascular risk factors , it would be of importance to study the effect of metformin therapy in the context of omentin-1 biology on reactive oxygen species in pcos women , as reactive oxygen species not only induces tissue damage and inflammation but also is increased in dysmetabolic states including pcos ( 44 ) . in conclusion , we provide evidence that increases in omentin-1 levels may play a role but are not sufficient to explain the decreased inflammatory and angiogenic effects of sera from metformin - treated pcos women .
we report that metformin ( 6 months treatment ; 850 mg twice daily ) significantly increases serum omentin-1 levels with concomitant decreases in insulin resistance and carotid imt in pcos subjects .
