in our series , the patients registered a significant improvement in both near and distance stereopsis postsurgery ( p < 0.001 ) . there are only anecdotal reports in literature describing the improvement in stereopsis following posterior chamber piols implantation . however , these studies were limited by reporting outcome for change in stereopsis in a small number of patients that were treated for varied refractive errors , at differing age and with different types of piol
it may be utilized as a therapeutic procedure for poor stereopsis preoperatively in certain sportspersons , e.g. in athletes , shooters , car racers . near stereopsis
the difference ( two - sample paired t - test ) was not found to be statistically significant for change in near stereoacuity with change in ucva ( p = 0.3 ) , bcva ( p = 0.8 ) , spherical equivalent ( p = 0.8 ) , and anisometropia ( p = 0.5 ) .
the change in stereoacuity pre- and post - operatively when divided into the categories nonrecordable , gross , and fine stereoacuity
pre- and post - operative visual acuity ( snellen equivalent converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ) , stereoacuity , refractive error ( spherical , cylindrical , and spherical equivalent ) , and degree of anisometropia ( algebraic difference of the spherical equivalent between the two eyes ) were analyzed .
