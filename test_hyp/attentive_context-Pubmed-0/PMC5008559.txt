several photorefractors were developed . among these was the plusoptix s09 photorefractor ( plusoptix gmbh , nuernberg , germany ) , developed for children and the disabled , and is a noninvasive tool for the rapid assessment of both eyes for refractive errors , pupil size , and inter - pupillary distance .
the patients were categorized according to 2 methods : ( i ) 11 eyes with hyperopia +3.0 d and 66 eyes with hyperopia < + 3.0 d , emmetropia , and myopia ; ( ii ) 12 eyes with cycloplegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power +2.0 d and 65 eyes with cyclopegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power
the mean spherical power and spherical equivalent recorded using the plusoptix s09 were 1.53    2.01 d and 1.33    1.97 d , respectively , whereas using the cycloplegic autorefractometer they were 0.61    2.02 d and 0.73    2.05 d , respectively , in all the children , which were not significantly different between the 2 devices ( paired t - test , p  >  0.05 ) .
however , when it is used to estimate the refractive error in a child with hyperopia of +3.0 d , the refractive error should be corrected after a comparison of the refractive errors of the plusoptix s09 with those of a cycloplegic autorefractometer .
