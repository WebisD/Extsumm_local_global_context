we report the first case of acute kidney injury caused by arterial air embolism injury in a 27-year - old caucasian recreational diver following three rapid ascents .
the primary goal , however , remains the prevention of pulmonary barotrauma , a potentially fatal complication of diving .
divers should be screened during dive medical for conditions predisposing to barotrauma ( airway obstruction , bullae , reduced lung compliance ) and diving courses emphasize the importance of controlled ascent and avoiding breath - holding .
decompression illness is caused by intravascular or extravascular gas bubble formation following rapid reduction in environmental pressure as seen with diving accidents .
hbo results in complete resolution of symptoms in most cases , whereas mild residual symptoms may persist in a few and serious complications in a minority of cases .
decompression illness due to arterial air embolism following rapid ascent is a serious diving complication and can present with multi - organ involvement including the kidneys as demonstrated in this case . upon rescue onto the support boat the patient was positioned supine whilst the boat was rocking in the waves , which may have contributed to embolization at multiple sites , including the central nervous system , the mesenteric circulation , as suggested by elevated lactate and abdominal pain and the kidneys .
