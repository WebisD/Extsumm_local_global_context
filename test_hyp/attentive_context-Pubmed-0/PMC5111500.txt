we report a case of dramatic outcome of an observation of severe hemolytic anaemia in a newborn due to rh1 incompatibility , which led to death .
hemolytic disease of the newborn related to rh1 incompatibility is rare but serious . in order to avoid this drama ,
it is necessary to strengthen the prevention and clinico - biological monitoring in patients with a history of feto - maternal rhesus alloimmunization by sensitizing and advising all rh1 negative unimmunized women that rh1 prophylaxis should be applied after all birthing of rh1 child and must also always be carried out after any miscarriage .
the rh1 alloimmunization responsible for the hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs when the rh1-negative mother s blood comes into contact with the foetus s rh1 positive red blood cells . after the passing of foetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation , the rh1 antigens on foetal red blood cells , which are foreign antigens to the maternal immune system , trigger the immunological processes producing anti - rh1 allo - antibodies of the immunoglobulin class igg .
a male newborn presenting the antecedents of consanguinity was admitted 30 minutes of life to the pediatric department of mohammed v military teaching hospital for the issue of hydrops fetalis on rhesus incompatibility ; the birth weight was 1800 g and his blood group was a rh1 .
