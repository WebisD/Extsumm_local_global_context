vitamin d deficiency ( vdd ) is defined as serum 25-hydroxy vitamin d ( 25ohd ) levels < 20 ng / ml .
calcium is released from bone under the effect of vitamin d - pth system to maintain its homeostasis .
further studies are required to define adverse biological consequences of vdd in this group and effects of vitamin d supplementation and comparing them with the population who already had adverse biological effects of vdd .
hence , the subjects with vdd defined by low vitamin d levels ( < 20 ng / ml or < 30 ng / ml ) according to the current definition with normal pth and bmd will not have any clinical and biochemical consequence of low vitamin d levels and vice versa subjects with similar levels of serum 25ohd with raised pth or low bmd are likely to be vdd . what should we call subjects with low serum 25ohd levels without evidence of shpt or low bmd ?
failure of adaptive mechanism will lead to clinical and biochemical evidence of vdd . among them
this raises logical question  do all subjects with vdd have clinical disease according to this definition ?  the main physiological function of vitamin d is maintenance of calcium homeostasis by its effect on calcium absorption and bone health in association with parathyroid gland .
