we present a case of undetected ocd presenting as repeated seizures , which is an indirect relationship might be first of its kind in literature .
obsessive compulsive disorder ( ocd ) can manifest with a wide range of clinical pictures . on the other hand ,
there has been a long - standing observation that patients with various types of epilepsy / seizures have a higher incidence of many psychiatric disorders including ocd .
though the equation of seizures leading to ocd is a known phenomenon , but to our best knowledge , we could not find literature showing ocd to cause seizures directly or indirectly . here
a 45-year - old female from rural kashmir ( india ) , married with four children , with previous three to four admissions for generalized tonic - clonic seizures from last 3 years was presently again admitted with two episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures .
since epilepsy affects more than 50 million people worldwide , 80% of them live in developing world and a substantial number has no attributable cause , our finding is important in finding an indirect etiology ( ocd ) of seizures .
it will help in avoiding unnecessary continuous antiepileptic and more importantly it shows a different presentation of ocd ( close to psychogenic polydipsia ) for which both emergency residents and the psychiatrists should scratch into .
