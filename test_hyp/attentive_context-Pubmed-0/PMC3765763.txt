the film poly-(p - allyl ether benzenesulfonic acid ) catalyzes the reduction of ni , pd , and pt to the corresponding m noble metals by binding the ions in the valence sphere of the free sulfonate group .
this work describes the catalytic properties of the film poly-(p - allyl ether benzenesulfonic acid ) in the reduction of noble metal ions to their corresponding metals by sodium hypophosphite .
the electrochemical hydrogen generation of two kinds of electrodes , one prepared by electrochemical reduction of the metal ions and the other by this catalytic process , showed that the latter method is more efficient than the former . the me pt is the most efficient in acid ph , whereas me ni is the most efficient in basic ph .
sodium hypophosphite transfers the electrons through the hydride ion when it is oxidized by water to phosphite or phosphoric acid . sem and eds analyses showed the presence of metal crystals dispersed in the film in an amount higher than the equivalent molecular polymer unit , which confirms the catalytic effect on the reduction reaction .
when mes are prepared by the catalytic process , less energy is necessary for initiation of the hydrogen generation useful for the catalytic hydrogenation of organic substrates , compared with the process involving the electrochemical preparation of mes .
