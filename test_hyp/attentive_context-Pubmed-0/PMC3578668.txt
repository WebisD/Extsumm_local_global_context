we report the case of a 19-year - old female football spectator who suffered a duodenal rupture as a result of being hit in the abdomen by a football .
a 19-year - old girl presented to the emergency department at 1 am after having a football kicked from a distance of 510 m into her abdomen 7 h previously whilst watching a game .
it also shows the benefit of ct scanning in the diagnosis and management of duodenal rupture .
duodenal rupture as a result of a sporting injury is very rare and there are no reports of duodenal injury from the specific mechanism described in this report   .
a computed tomographic ( ct ) scan of her abdomen and pelvis was arranged , which showed abnormal areas of low attenuation and multiple pockets of air in the right flank , surrounding the right kidney and in the right sub - hepatic space , consistent with a perforation of either the ascending colon or the duodenum ( fig .  1 ) .
the duodenum is a  c-shaped organ primarily situated in the retroperitoneum and is anatomically divided into four sections ( d1d4 ) .
the finding of fluid in the right anterior para - renal space on a ct scan may be seen in the presence of a duodenal haematoma , whereas if air is seen in this area duodenal rupture is likely to have occurred   . in this case , ct scanning was useful in delineating the possible area where a perforation may be found , especially as the patient presented with generalized abdominal pain .
