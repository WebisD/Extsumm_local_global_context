adjustment for potential confounders , with or without fetal growth , had only modest effects on the ors . in the fully adjusted model , comparing young adults born preterm ( < 37 weeks gestation ) to those born full term , the or for any diabetes medication prescription was 1.13 ( 95% ci 1.021.26 ) and for insulin without oral diabetes medication prescription 1.22 ( 1.081.39 ) .
no first - order interactions were statistically significant at the p < 0.01 level , including no interaction between gestational age at birth and fetal growth ( p = 0.33 ) .
the other potential confounders included in adjusted model 1 , ors were 1.41 ( 95% ci 1.261.59 ) and 1.13 ( 1.061.21 ) for the two smallest fetal growth categories
a weak association also was found between poor fetal growth and diabetes medication prescription in young adulthood . after adjusting for gestational age at birth and
ors for association between gestational age at birth ( 19731979 ) and diabetes medication prescription in young adulthood ( ages 25.537.0 years ) * adjusted for age , sex , maternal age at delivery , maternal marital status , maternal education , family income , and maternal prescription of diabetes medications during the follow - up period ( 1 july 2005 through 31 december 2009 ) .
