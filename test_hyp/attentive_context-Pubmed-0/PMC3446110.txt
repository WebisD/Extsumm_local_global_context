this study intends to assess the effect of corticosteroid on linear body growth of children .
cross - tabulation between htsds of the first and last follow - up visit sds : standard deviation score/ht : gains and losses in percentiles of height ( growth change ) sixty - two children ( group a ) had linear growth improvement during the follow - up time , whereas 85 ( group b ) were found to have growth retardation . those who had improved linear growth included 40 males and 22 females with the mean initial and final ht 
 sds of -1.631.87 and -0.082.13 respectively ( p<0.001 ) .
comparison of growth determinants between children according to their growth status , improvement ( group a ) or retardation ( group b ) sds : standard deviation score comparison of growth indicators between patients who used prednisolone alone and those who used additional steroid - sparin ssa : steroid sparing agent/ht : gains and losses in percentiles of height ( growth change ) linear growth was not related to age at onset , age at final follow - up , duration of the disease , or cumulative dosage of psl ( table 4 ) . 
  pearson correlation coefficients and significance ( p. values ) between growth change ( htsds ) and growth determinants we also compared the various histological types of ns for differences in the growth indicators .
