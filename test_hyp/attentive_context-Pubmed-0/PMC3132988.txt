recent studies have increased our understanding of the mechanisms by which the b subunit imparts specificity to the holoenzyme complex . through selective incorporation of the b
cellular adaptation requires biochemical processes including post - translational mechanisms to modify existing proteins . catalyzed by opposing kinases and phosphatases , reversible phosphorylation of serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues is now appreciated as a fundamental regulatory mechanism with the majority of phosphorylation ( > 99% ) occurring on serine and threonine residues   . due to their untapped therapeutic potential ,
pp2a is a ubiquitous protein phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of many different intracellular targets . the diverse repertoire of potential substrates for pp2a is imparted by the incorporation of one of fifteen unique b - regulatory subunits .
the ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) has been proposed as a target for the treatment of a number of pathologies ranging from neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer disease to a variety of neoplasias   .      
protein phosphatases have been identified as promising targets for xenobiotic manipulation through rational drug design ( reviewed in   ) . in particular ,
compared to other members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase ( ppp ) superfamily of serine / threonine phosphatases , a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which pp2a recognizes substrates and mediates site - specific dephosphorylation remains to be developed . sequence and structural homology of the catalytic subunits of ppp family members
