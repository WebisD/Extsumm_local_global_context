the objective of this study was to investigate the presence of hpv dna and the most frequent viral types in patients with oscc , and to compare the immunohistochemical expression of the cell - cycle proteins p21 and prb between hpv - positive and hpv - negative cases in order to establish a possible correlation between the expression of these proteins and hpv infection in oscc .
expression of p21 was observed in 5/11 ( 45.45% ) hpv - positive tumors and in 7/22 ( 31.82% ) hpv - negative tumors ( figure 2b ) .
with respect to the expression of protein p21 , no significant association was observed between the expression of this protein and the presence of the virus ( p=0.416 ) .
of the 33 samples that were positive for the human -globin gene ( figure 1a ) , hpv 16 and/or hpv 18 were detected in 11 ( 33.33% ) ( figure 1b ) .
in the present study , hpv dna was detected in a low percentage of oscc cases ( 33.33% ) , suggesting that hpv plays a key role in the development and progression of only a small subgroup of these carcinomas .
