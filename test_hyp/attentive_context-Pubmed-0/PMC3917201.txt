the purpose of the present investigation was to examine neutrophil chemotaxis , phagocytosis , intracellular killing and superoxide ion generation in a group of patients with lap compared with healthy subjects in the indian population .
in conclusion , the findings of the present study support the earlier observations that impaired neutrophil functions such as deficient neutrophil chemotaxis , phagocytosis and intracellular killing and increased superoxide generation are associated with lap , and may also serve as predisposing factors for lap in the indian population .
research has indicated a more prominent role of oxidative damage to periodontal tissues due to increased superoxide generation by lap neutrophils . however , further studies with a large sample size are required to ( 1 ) elaborate on more a direct association of microbiological , immunological and genetic factors predisposing to aggressive periodontitis , ( 2 ) ascertain the cause - and - effect relationship of defective host factors such as defective neutrophil functions and aggressive periodontitis in the indian population and ( 3 ) develop therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing this neutrophil - mediated oxidative damage and restore the antibacterial properties of the neutrophils for a healthy periodontal support structure .
the present investigation was aimed to assess neutrophil chemotaxis , phagocytosis , intracellular killing and superoxide generation in lap patients in an indian population .
