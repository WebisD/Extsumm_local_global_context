adsorbent interaction energy characterising adsorption in a porous material , and we introduce a quantitative metric esurf ( based on the relaxation time ratio ) characterising the strength of this surface interaction .
in this work we have presented a theoretical analysis to show that the ratio of nmr relaxation times , t1/t2 , can be related directly to the adsorbate 
nmr relaxation has been validated as a robust and versatile tool for quantitatively comparing liquid 
, we now have a physical interpretation of the nmr relaxation data in terms of a surface activation energy of desorption .
given that the relaxation time characteristics of the nuclear spin system will be dominated by the strongest adsorption sites , the hypothesis that t2/t1 should correlate directly with the maximum activation energy of desorption observed in a temperature - programmed desorption experiment was tested ; the data were found to support this hypothesis . given this result
further , given that nmr relaxation is readily extended to measurements at elevated conditions of temperature and pressure , these results suggest that the technique might be considered a useful addition to the toolkit of techniques employed to characterise adsorption in porous media used for applications in catalysis and separations processes . beyond these applications , demonstrating that t1/t2 , when expressed as esurf , is a quantitative measure of interaction strength has implications for determining surface wettability in oil - field reservoir rocks , an important parameter for predicting oil recovery .
