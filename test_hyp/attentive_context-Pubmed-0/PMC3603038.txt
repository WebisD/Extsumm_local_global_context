isolated post - prandial hyperglycemia ( pphg ) , as occurs in impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) , has been shown to double the risk for cardiovascular ( cv ) mortality .
pphg and cancer : pphg and factors known to promote post - meal hyperglycemia are implicated in the development of cancer .
controlling pphg has been demonstrated to improve myocardial flow and function.pphg and oxidative stress , inflammation , and endothelial dysfunction : treating post - prandial hyperglycemia can improve oxidative stress , inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , and thrombosis.pphg and cimt : carotid intima  media thickness ( cimt ) was significantly increased in the top quintile of 2 h pppg ( 148  200 mg / dl).pphg and micro - vascular complications : pphg had a stronger correlation with the incidence of diabetic microangiopathy compared with hba1c levels.pphg and cognitive function : exaggerated ppg excursions are associated with a derangement of both global , executive and attention functioning.pphg and cancer : pphg and factors known to promote post - meal hyperglycemia are implicated in the development of cancer . 
 
the heart 2d study , assigned t2 dm patients to prandial ( lispro ) and basal ( nph or glargine ) strategy , did not show a beneficial effect of preferentially treating pphg in reducing further cv events in people with diabetes who had an acute mi . a recent post - hoc analysis , however , suggested that older patients may have a lower risk for a subsequent cv event .
