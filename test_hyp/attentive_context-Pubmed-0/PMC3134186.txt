the objective was to develop a novel teaching tool for severe malaria , using high - fidelity simulation that emphasizes predefined learning objectives for the disease .
high - fidelity simulation constitutes a novel tool for teaching severe malaria that can meet specific learning objectives by demonstrating the need for time - dependent critical actions . in non - endemic countries
high - fidelity simulation refers to simulation scenarios with mannequins that can reproduce a wide range of patient characteristics .   according to a recent review of simulation in emergency medicine ,
it may be rare to witness a case of this disease ,   but , given its life - threatening nature , it is imperative that our learners are aware of this disease , know how to treat it , and have experience with its presentation , whether real or simulated , so they can manage it quickly and effectively as health care providers .
learning objectives were derived from a selection of recent publications searched for in medline under malaria and severe malaria , with limits  review  , and from their respective reference lists   , as well as from the authors ' prior experience in teaching malaria .
