paralytic rabies occurring after postexposure antirabies vaccination creates a diagnostic dilemma as vaccine - induced gbs becomes a distinct possibility .
we report here two cases of paralytic rabies who received four doses of postexposure ( grade iii dog bite ) vaccination without rabies immunoglobulin .
the diagnosis of rabies is not very difficult when associated with the classical features of excitations or phobias ( aerophobia , hydrophobia ) .
but it can be quite challenging when presented as acute flaccid paralysis ( afp ) .
a ten year - old boy presented with sudden weakness of both lower limbs for two days .
if there is an inadequate stool sample with residual paralysis , death of the patient , or loss to follow - up at the time of afp surveillance , the case is referred to the national expert committee ( national polio surveillance project ) review for final classification as nonpolio afp or compatible with poliomyelitis . in our first case
notable signs include myoedema , particularly in the region of the chest , deltoid muscles , and thighs . however , this phenomenon , a brief , unpropagated , localized muscle contraction that appears in response to percussion with a tendon hammer , is not a confirmatory sign of paralytic rabies but was present in our 2 case .
