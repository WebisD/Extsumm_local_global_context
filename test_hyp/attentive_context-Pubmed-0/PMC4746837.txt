the purpose of this study was to assess the utility of f-18 fluoride pet / ct bone scan in the diagnosis of fhavn and compare it with mri .
f-18 fluoride pet / ct showed good agreement with mri in the initial diagnosis of fhavn . it can be especially useful in detecting early disease and also in patients in whom mri is contraindicated .
of the remaining 11 patients , 3 patients had degenerative arthritis , 4 had transient osteoporosis of the hip [ figure 3 ] , and 4 were normal on both imaging modalities
two patients with history of long - term steroid use for systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , with pain in multiple joints underwent total body pet / ct .
the agreement between the two imaging modalities for the diagnosis of fhavn was 96.07% . using the rois drawn on the affected femoral head , the photopenic area and normal femoral head as described , mean ( range ) suvmax of the photopenic area was 1.9 ( 0.22.8 ) , affected femoral head was 21.3 ( 8.242.8 ) and normal femoral head was 4.4 ( 3.56.7 ) .
sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of mri and pet / ct compared to composite gold standard .
