we will discuss recent developments in the potential use of biomarkers for jia , for predicting the type , severity , and progression of disease after onset and the development of complications linked to jia , and their effect on our ability to predict response to treatment and determine when stable disease remission has been reached .
, biomarkers may assist with predicting disease type , course or severity , with predicting response to medication and therefore aiding treatment choices , and with accurate identification of children who can safely stop medication once apparent clinical remission is reached .
data from these studies are sometimes extrapolated to children without considering differences in disease pathogenesis , age - dependent changes in reference ranges for biological laboratory measures , growth and development of children over time , effect of ontogeny on disease evolution and response to treatment , and changes in phenotypic gene expression   . despite the huge potential of paediatric biomarkers , for jia
juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( jia ) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease in childhood , affecting one in 1000 children .
multi - centre and international collaborations are needed to give every child with jia the opportunity to take part in biomarker and cohort studies .
