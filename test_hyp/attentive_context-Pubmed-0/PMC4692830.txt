we aimed to evaluate procedural data and periprocedural and long - term complication rates of upgrade procedures compared with de novo crt implantations in our university medical centre .
they more often had ischaemic cardiomyopathy ( p  =  0.049 ) and a history of atrial fibrillation ( p  =  0.008 ) and were more often on amiodarone ( p  <  0.001 ) and a vitamin k antagonist ( p  =  0.022 ) .
in a device implantation centre with experienced operators , crt upgrade procedures are not associated with more complications nor do they seem more complex compared with de novo crt implantations .
seventy - three ( 27  % ) procedures were extended by study - related lv pressure ( lv dp / dt max ) measurements to optimise lead positions and device settings .
264 ( 98.5  % ) received a crt defibrillator ( crt - d ) , three ( 2.2  % ) patients were upgraded to a crt pacemaker ( crt - p ) and one ( 0.7  % ) patient received a de novo crt - p .
upgrade patients were more often males ( p  =  0.011 ) and of older age ( p  =  0.001 ) than the random sample of patients receiving a de novo crt implantation .
