a 67-year - old healthy retired man developed an asymptomatic greenish discoloration of the nail plate of the right toe nail over a period of 2 months .
treatment with an oral quinolone ( ciprofloxacin ) , particularly in aged patients when laboratory investigations are difficult to perform , could be a valuable option .
bacterial infections of the nails are caused by gram - negative bacteria , usually p. aeruginosa , but can also be caused by klebsiella spp .
p. aeruginosa is not part of normal skin flora , so pseudomonas infections of the intact nail are rare .
were followed by positive results . a 56-year - old man , diagnosed 1 year earlier with toenail onychomycosis , in the absence of any treatment , developed greenish discoloration of the entire nail plate .
recently it has been reported a strong relation between fungal and p aeruginosa infection of the nail : fungal infection stimulates bacterial colonization within the nail and overgrowth of p aeruginosa in culture inhibits the isolation of fungus.7 the differential diagnosis includes subungal hematoma , malignant melanoma , infections caused by other pathogens such as aspergillus , candida , and proteus , and chemical exposure to solutions containing pyocyanin or pyoverdine.8 the treatment of chloronychia , especially in elderly people , is difficult in many cases and recommendations based on clinical trials are missing.3 in the past , removal of the entire nail was a therapeutic option , but not nowadays .
