gee was used to examine for differences in urinary iodine creatinine ratios between the two groups from week 4 onwards and no significant group effect was identified ( p = 0.53 ) . in a separate gee model we did not identify any significant time effect ( p = 0.19 ) or time  group interaction ( p = 0.84 ) . a gee model with change from baseline from week 4 onwards showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups , lower in the thyroidectomised thyroid cancer group ( parameter 113.1  microg / g [ 95% confidence interval 12.8 to 213.3  microg / g ] , p = 0.027 ) .
the objective of this study is to compare iodine clearance following iodinated contrast administration in thyroidectomised thyroid cancer patients and euthyroid individuals .
the mean urinary iodine creatinine ratio was 248.2  microg / g at baseline for the thyroidectomised thyroid cancer patients and 138.3  microg / g at baseline for the control patients . as anticipated , the two - week mean values were still elevated above baseline ( thyroidectomised thyroid cancer 770.3  microg / g versus 670.3  microg / g control groups ) . 

this suggests that clearance time may be more rapid than previously thought and that a shorter time interval between iodinated contrast and radioiodine therapy might be considered but requires confirmation in larger studies that include a broad case mix in terms of age and dietary iodine intake .
