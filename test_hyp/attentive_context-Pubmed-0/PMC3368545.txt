this review of clinical and experimental data on the effects of aging , estrogens , and hrt on vascular function of females aims to clarify how menopause and aging contribute jointly to vascular aging and how estrogen modulates vascular response at different ages .
information about the role of age and menopause in the development of cvd in women is scarce .
cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is the leading cause of mortality in both men and women in developed countries .
our society is aging progressively , and increased life expectancy enhances the risks for diseases associated with the natural fatigue of the body , including cvd . despite this undeniable reality , there is evidence that vascular aging in women does not follow the same chronology as in men .
much research effort is still needed to understand age- and sex - related differences in cardiovascular control , establish the impact of the menstrual cycle and hrt on vascular function , and propose new therapeutic strategies to improve cvd diagnosis and treatment and the overall management of vascular senescence in women .
the vascular protective effects exerted by estrogens have been proposed as the major reason for reduced signs of vascular aging and cvd risk in premenopausal women , compared to men . when natural estrogen withdrawal occurs and a woman enters her climacteric stage , effects of sudden vascular aging become evident , leading to vascular dysfunction and increased risk of a cardiovascular event .
