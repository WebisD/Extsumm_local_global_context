absence of nighttime heartburn during treatment was significantly predictive of complete relief ( adjusted or 4.96 ; 95  % ci 1.0822.84 ; p  =  0.0400 ) and was borderline significantly predictive for relief ( adjusted or 4.40 ; 95  % ci 0.9420.54 ; p  =  0.0595 ) .
0.0001 ; run - in sleep disturbance frequency : adjusted or 0.56 ; 95  % ci 0.490.64 ; p  <  0.0001 ) of reflux - associated sleep disturbance . in separate analyses conducted for complete relief and relief where an interaction term was added to the model ,
treatment with esomeprazole 20  mg was an important positive predictor of complete resolution of heartburn / reflux - related sleep disturbance in this analysis , while higher frequency of sleep disturbances during the run - in period was an important negative predictor of sleep disturbance resolution .
daytime heartburn during treatment was a borderline significant predictor ( adjusted or 2.66 ; 95  % ci 0.937.63 ; p  =  0.0678 ) , and gender was found not to be significantly predictive ( adjusted or 0.77 ; 95  % ci 0.521.12 ; p  =  0.1752 ) of complete relief ; gender was not analyzed for relief of sleep disturbances .
