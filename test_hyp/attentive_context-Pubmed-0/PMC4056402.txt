the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal action of various concentrations of white - colored mta against seven different c. albicans strains for various exposure periods using the tube dilution test .
, it appears that under the conditions of this study , white - colored mta in concentrations of 100 and 50 mg / ml is effective in inhibiting the seven tested strains of c. albicans for periods up to 1 week .
a significant difference was found between tubes containing strain 3 and tubes containing other strains at mta concentrations of 12.5 and 25 mg / ml at the 3-days time period ( p < 0.001 ) .
effect of various mta concentrations on growth of c. albicans strains statistically , a significant difference was found between tubes containing either strain 3 or 4 and tubes containing other strains at all mta concentrations at the 1-day time period ( p < 0.001 ) .
a total of 1287 broth tubes were prepared and divided into seven sets with experimental groups of 11 tubes each and control groups .
however , the antifungal activity of white - colored and gray - colored mta over longer periods of time on more number of strains merits further investigation .
