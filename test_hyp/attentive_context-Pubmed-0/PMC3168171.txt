this mini - review describes the toxic effects of vanadium pentoxide inhalation principally in the workplace and associated complications with breathing and respiration .
vanadium pentoxide exposure ( acutely and chronically ) in both experimental animal and human studies indicates a systemic patho - physiological and pathological influence on cell metabolism and tissue function .
indeed , there is limited understanding of the potential for dermal absorption and the potential long term effects as a result of sequestration in body tissues such as bone .
medical monitoring of workers exposed to the dust or fumes ; workplace monitoring and measurement of ambient concentrations ; dealing with contaminated attire and establishing personal hygienic procedures ; dealing with emergency spills of dust ; enforcing protocols for emergencies and hazardous waste management ; and the use of inspected respiratory and personal protective equipment , are all essential in reducing toxic exposure .
vanadium pentoxide has adverse effects on health and well - being and measures need to be taken to prevent hazardous exposure of the like .
obviously , however , a systemic assessment via renal and liver function tests needs to be completed in order to make an accurate clinical assessment of the influence of vanadium on body function and ultimately the efficient maintenance of homeostasis .
