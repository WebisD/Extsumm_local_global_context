a 37-year - old lady presented to us with complaints of neck pain and gait disturbances of 1 year duration with severe progressive weakness of her right upper limb since 3 months .
the location of these lesions in the spinal cord suggest a subpial glial progenitor origin rather than its proposed origin from subependymal progenitor cells. 
residual or recurrent tumor on follow up after gross total resection should be strongly considered for a re - excision rather than adjuvant therapy. 
( a ) sagittal t2 and ( b ) post contrast t1-weighted mr images showing a long segment t2 hyperintense and mild hetrogenous enhancing lesions in the cervical cord , showing cord expansion .
subependymoma , first described by scheinker in 1945 , is a rare central nervous system tumor . since its first description in the spinal cord by boykin et al in 1954 ,
mri revealed a long - segment t2 hyperintense intramedullary lesion opposite to the c3 to d4 vertebral levels with mild heterogeneous enhancement on the post contrast study [ figure 1 ] .
surgical finding : typical exophytic subpial lesions , with lesion on either sides of the dorsal nerve roots .
intraoperatively , the lesion was firm , with a poor plane of demarcation from the normal cord , and was seen intermingling with posterior and anterior nerve rootlets .
