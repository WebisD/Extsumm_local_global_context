our results therefore indicate that upregulated xod can be an additional source of ros in vascular compartment , implicated in chronic oxidative injury and endothelial dysfunction in t2 dm patients with poor glycemic control , contributing overtime to the development of dpn .
nonetheless , the current study has demonstrated that augmented xod activity was present within vascular compartment in t2 dm patients diagnosed with dpn . moreover , serum xod activity was closely correlated to risk factors relevant for the development of dpn , including poor glycemic control , obesity , and serum i m a and ua levels , which are considered as markers of generalized endothelial dysfunction in diabetics .
given that xod could be a significant source of ros in vascular compartment causing endothelial dysfunction , and a possible therapeutic target , this study was aimed at investigating the relationship between xod and dpn in t2 dm patients .
, serum xod activity was directly correlated to bmi , the presence of hypertension , and levels of hba1c , age , i m a , and ua and inversely correlated to serum albumin and total thiol groups concentrations ( table 3 ) . correlations between xod activity and age , duration of diabetes , aip , aopp , and microalbuminuria were not significant .
