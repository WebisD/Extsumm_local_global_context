we describe a case of dfa aneurysm in a patient who was successfully treated with aneurysmectomy and revascularization with an artificial blood vessel graft .
surgery plays an important part in the treatment of this disease , but standard methods have not been established because of its rarity . in our patient , we successfully performed an aneurysmectomy and revascularization to the distal dfa with an artificial blood vessel graft .
therefore , we consider our case of an isolated dfa aneurysm to be extremely rare .
a 58-year - old man presented with paralysis and pain in the left leg , and a mass was found in his thigh . because of the growth of the mass and the worsening of his symptoms , the patient visited a neighboring hospital .
peripheral arterial aneurysms are rare , and among these , deep femoral arterial ( dfa ) aneurysms are extremely rare   .
these aneurysms have a high rate of rupture , and surgery plays an important role in their treatment .
, we consider the surgery a success because the patient recovered well from the surgery without complications , his symptoms improved and the blood flow in the leg was preserved . in conclusion , dfa aneurysms are extremely rare .
