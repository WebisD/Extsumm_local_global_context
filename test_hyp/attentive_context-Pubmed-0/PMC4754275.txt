pvfm is a disorder that presents paradoxical adduction of the vocal fold during inspiration and abduction during expiration .
oxygen supply and positive pressure ventilation could be applied first in a case of pvfm when the patient complains of severe inspiratory dyspnea after endotracheal extubation .
a 67-year - old male ( height , 165.4 cm ; weight , 69.1 kg ) with a history of hypertension and hyperthyroidism was scheduled to excise a laryngeal mass because of right vocal fold leukoplakia .
if the patient continues to suffer from prolonged dyspnea after supplying oxygen and positive pressure ventilation , cpap could be effective before performing invasive procedures , such as endotracheal intubation or a tracheostomy .
pvfm is very difficult for anesthesiologists to diagnose in the post - anesthesia care unit because the gold standard for pvfm is transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy .
the symptoms of pvfm are inspiratory stridor , shortness of breath , choking sensation , voice changes , and cough due to the limited airway opening associated with paradoxical vocal fold adduction
, pvfm was considered as neurologic or psychiatric disorder , therefore it was described as " munchausen 's stridor " .
invasive procedures , such as endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy , are performed under a falling oxygen saturation condition due to near complete vocal cord obstruction . in this case , the patient was self - medicating with a benzodiazepine preoperatively because of concern about the right hand tremor .
