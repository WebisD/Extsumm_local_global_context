the aim of this study is to assess the possible reduction in the extent of acute kidney injury after administration of eugenol in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis .
in conclusion , the administration of eugenol in a rat model of acute pancreatitis was protective for the kidneys in our experimental model .
indeed , a difference in the extent of kidney injury between the eugenol and control groups is first observed 48 hours after the onset of acute pancreatitis and it is greater at 72 hours .
the animals were randomly assigned in 3 groups : sham ( n = 20 ) , control ( n = 46 ) , and eugenol ( n = 40 ) .
to evaluate the extent of kidney injury , we decided to evaluate serum urea and creatinine levels and the histopathological changes in the kidney , as well as the expression of tnf- , il-6 , and mpo in the renal parenchyma .
the results of this study suggest that eugenol attenuates the intensity of the histopathological changes and the expression of tnf- and mpo in the renal parenchyma , while lowering the values of serum urea and creatinine when administered in a rat acute pancreatitis experimental model .
