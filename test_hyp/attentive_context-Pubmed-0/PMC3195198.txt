first described the entity of eustachian valve endocarditis ( eve ) in an autopsy study of a patient with overwhelming streptococcal sepsis . in the literature only few cases have been reported so far .
herein , we review the literature and describe 2 new cases in which the causative organisms were determined to be vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( vrsa ) , which is reported for the first time , and staphylococcus hominis .
right sided valvular involvement in infective endocarditis has been well - described , but lesions affecting eustachian valve are distinctly rare . in 1986 , edwards et al .
we found the incidence of eve to be highest in young intra - venous drug users , and staphylococcus aureus to be the most common microbial agent .
it should be strongly considered when a patient has the clinical syndrome of right - sided endocarditis , but no vegetations are identified on tte .
although eve is rare , it may be unwise to rule out this diagnosis based solely on tte , especially in the setting of persistent bacteremia or pulmonary emboli .
eustachian valve is an embryological remnant of the sinus venosus , directing oxygenated fetal blood from inferior vena cava across foramen ovale , and into the left atrium . in adults , it is non - functional and is considered a benign rudimentary structure .
