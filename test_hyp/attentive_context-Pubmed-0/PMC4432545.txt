the goal is to establish technical bases associated with partial glossectomy orthodontic treatment of dentofacial deformity in patients with macroglossia .
three patients underwent orthognathic surgery associated with partial glossectomy from 1995 to 1999 , a multidisciplinary team - doctor and dentist .
today , the treatment of choice is surgical excision of the tongue , but before 1900 , surgery was often temida1 . only in 1673 niels
the macroglossia is classified as true when there is excessive enlargement of the language and a relative when there is an imbalance between the size of the tongue and oral cavity , resulting in insufficient space for organ4 .
should be included the clinical , radiographic and functional for the interference with speech , mastication , airway and stability of orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery .
there are basically three choices in the surgical sequence : ( i ) stage 1 : partial glossectomy , stage 2 : orthognathic surgery ( ii ) stage 1 : orthognathic surgery , stage 2 : partial glossectomy and ( iii ) partial glossectomy and orthognathic surgery in a single stage surgery .
primary congenital macroglossia is due to the excessive development of the musculature , which may or may not be associated with generalized muscular hypertrophy or unilateral hypertrophy . since the secondary macroglossia may occur as a result of a tumor in the tongue , as a diffuse hemangioma or lymphangioma , neurofibromatosis , and occasionally blocking efferent vessels in cases of malignant neoplasm of the tongue .
