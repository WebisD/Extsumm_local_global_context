the ct reconstruction algorithm is 
 overviewed , and then each of our acceleration techniques is 
 described . in section 3 , numerical experiments on 
 various datasets and different pcs are presented to 
 evaluate the speedups with our scheme and the conventional 
 implementation . in section 4 , relevant issues and 
 research directions are discussed .
bolus - chasing computed tomography ( ct ) angiography is 
 a primary example which demands real - time ct feedback . to address this problem ,
a multi - core pc - based acceleration scheme is 
 proposed for filtered - backprojection-(fbp- ) based image 
 reconstruction .
third , the single - instruction multiple - data 
 ( simd ) technique is employed for data - level parallel processing . 

fourth , the multithreading programing is done to take advantage of 
 multi - core processors , realizing the true parallel computation 
 capability . finally , an intel c++ complier is used to optimize the 
 code for intel processors .
another bottle - neck is that the graphic 
 cards require data exchange between cpu and gpu . in this paper ,
however , due to the high computational cost required for 
 reconstruction , its real - time imaging applications   remain 
 challenging .
