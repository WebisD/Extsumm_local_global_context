, we report a case of cryptosporidiosis causing severe persistent diarrhea in a patient with multiple myeloma .
association of cryptosporidiosis with malignancies is not as robust as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) . here
the case we present here is the patient was a 64-year - old female who had been diagnosed to have multiple myeloma , stage iii b , type igg kappa 17 years ago in 1993 .
cryptosporidial diarrhea should be included in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent severe diarrhea , especially in patients with hematological malignancies .
it constitutes 24% of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) positive patients with diarrhea compared with 6.1% in the immunocompetent individuals .
cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic disease that causes diarrhea lasting for about 1 - 2 weeks among the immunocompetent and becoming a more severe life - threatening illness among immunocompromised individuals .
diagnosis can be established by stool examination and administration of nitazoxanide is effective in controlling the infection .
the clinical presentation in our patient with severe diarrhea of 2 weeks duration that resulted in dehydration and dyselectrolytemia was more consistent with an underlying immunodeficiency which is expected in a patient with long standing multiply treated myeloma .
