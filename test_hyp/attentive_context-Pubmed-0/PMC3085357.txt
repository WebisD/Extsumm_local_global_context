the aim was to survey the use of pesticides in guatambu , santa catarina state , brazil , and , through micronucleus testing , determine the risk and toxicological impact of pesticides contaminating regional dams .
this implies the possibility of pesticide effluents discharged into the river constituting a disease - hazard to local populations .
it is recommended that the river water be analyzed chemically , with a mind to identifying additional classes of toxicants that may also be contributing to genotoxicity in this specific water - shed .
the significant contribution to the environmental impact in the region , through the paramount , current use and handling of pesticides in small and middle - sized farms in the community , was amply proven .
micronucleate erythrocytes ( figure 2 ) were found mat different frequencies among the captured fish species , as shown in figure 3 , the highest mean values being observed in cyprinus carpio ( 15.33 in weir 4 , 15.00 and 14.00 in weir 8 .
, it was proven through in vivo piscine micronucleus testing , that water from the lambedor water - shed can be considered genotoxic , with emphasis on the degree of genotoxicity from pollution in the area .
