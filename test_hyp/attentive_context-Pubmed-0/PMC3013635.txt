addition of pre - aligned sequences for each of s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 and the s5-pore - s6 module , to allow easy access to a standardized data set for phylogenetic and comparative analysis , and addition of more functional electrophysiological parameters to provide a standardized set of data for structure / function analyses and refinement of subfamily designations .
the main enhancements planned over the next year are : 
 addition of pre - aligned sequences for each of s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 and the s5-pore - s6 module , to allow easy access to a standardized data set for phylogenetic and comparative analysis , andaddition of more functional electrophysiological parameters to provide a standardized set of data for structure / function analyses andrefinement of subfamily designations .
the original vkcdb ( 5 ) has been updated and expanded to provide support for evolutionary and comparative studies of the relationships between vkc sequence , electrophysiological characteristics of the individual channel proteins and ultimately the complex electrophysiological behavior of neurons and muscles in animals .
the existence of a diverse cohort of vkc paralogs within individual species of metazoa and of divergent orthologs between species indicates that the functional evolution of this family of proteins has been a significant factor in the evolution of electrophysiological excitability in the animal kingdom .
