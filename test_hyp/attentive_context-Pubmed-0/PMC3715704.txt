several facets of endoscopic management , including the potential benefits of nephron - sparing surgery , the multifocal recurrent nature of utuc , and the evolution in endoscopic technology , have contributed to this interest .
the recently published 2013 european association of urology guidelines indicate that conservative management of utuc can be considered in imperative or elective cases for low - grade , low - stage tumors . in this article
radical nephroureterectomy ( rnu ) with excision of the ipsilateral bladder cuff is considered to be the gold standard treatment for utuc . however , despite radical surgical intervention , it has become increasingly recognized that a significant proportion of patients still die from their disease , possibly as a result of micrometastasis at the time of operation , with a 5-year disease - specific mortality of 15% to 30% .
upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma ( utuc ) is uncommon , accounting for only 5% to 6% of all urothelial carcinomas .
the endoscopic management of utuc has traditionally been utilized only for patients with imperative indications , such as renal insufficiency or a solitary functional kidney , bilateral disease , or a significant comorbidity that precluded radical surgery .
