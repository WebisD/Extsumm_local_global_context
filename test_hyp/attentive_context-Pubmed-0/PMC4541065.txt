because , contrary to ird11 , there is an adaptive response to oxidative stress in ird5 , caused by glucose sensing / signaling which emerges in glucose starvation ( 29 ) . in light of the results of the present study
we suggest that the longevity of the ird5 mutant grown in both repressed and de - repressed conditions might be , in part , in consequence of glucose depletion condition caused by a reduced glucose consumption rate in these cells compared to the ird11 mutant and the wild type .
the oxidative stress - resistant mutant ird11 , which is affected by glucose signaling in a manner different from that caused by glucose deprivation ( 28 ) , had a lower lifespan extension than the wild type under repressed condition and had a higher lifespan extension than the wild type under de - repressed condition .
( 25 ) reported that the expression of the ntp1 and tps1 genes in s. pombe is partially regulated by the sty1p kinase under salt - induced osmotic stress and conditions of slight oxidative stress and is fully dependent on this kinase under severe oxidative stress .
accordingly , in the present study , through trehalose accumulation measurement and colony - forming unit ( cfu ) counting , we compared the ird mutants and the wild type to clarify the possible relationship between glucose signaling , oxidative stress response , and lifespan in s. pombe .
