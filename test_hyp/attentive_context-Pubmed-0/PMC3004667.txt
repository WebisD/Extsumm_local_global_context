the present study was designed to assess and evaluate the role of social support in a group of geriatric non - small cell lung cancer patients who were enrolled in two different cancer therapeutic clinical trials .
patients with metastatic non - small cell lung cancer suffer from a poor prognosis , as seen from both studies presented here where the prognosis was poor , and previous studies have demonstrated that elderly patients suffer from a wide constellation of cancer - related symptoms , including depression , guilt , debility , pain , and dyspnea.1013 although the present study did not observe an association between social support and clinical outcomes , there nonetheless remains a strong need for maximizing social support to help with some of the cancer - related challenges these patients face .
although there was a trend to suggest that higher social support scores ironically predicted a shorter time - to - cancer - progression ( p = 0.02 ; hazard ratio [ hr ] = 1.02 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] : 1.001.03 ) , these scores did not predict overall survival ( p = 0.34 ; hr = 1.01 ; 95% ci : 0.991.02 ) ( figure 2 ) .
