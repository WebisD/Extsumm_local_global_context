after 6 h fasting , the expression of the genes encoding major regulatory enzymes of extrahepatic gluconeogenesis [ g6pase , pepck - c , and glutaminase ] was dramatically induced in both the kidneys and intestine of l - g6pc mice . in the kidneys , amounts of g6pc mrna and protein were about twice those in the control ( fig .
instead , the early induction of gluconeogenesis in the kidneys and intestine occurs , permitting sustentation of egp and blood glucose right from the start of fasting periods .
we here report that , after a transient drop in plasma glucose as a result of incapacity to mobilize glycogen stores , the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose .
this may account for the basal induction of renal g6pc in the absence of hepatic glucose production and for the rapid induction of intestinal g6pc and pck1 once food is lacking .
, the renal glucose production could play a crucial role in the counterregulation of insulin - induced hypoglycemia in humans , a situation of increased glucagon and cortisol secretions ( 41,42 ) .
this leads us to conclude that the current dogma relating to the relative role of the liver vis -  - vis extrahepatic gluconeogenic organs in glucose homeostasis should be reconsidered .
