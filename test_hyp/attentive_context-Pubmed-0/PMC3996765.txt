pediatric myocardial perfusion imaging ( mpi ) is an established investigation in the evaluation of ischemia and myocardial viability .
asymptomatic patients post arterial switch ( aso ) surgeries are at low risk for myocardial ischemia , and much depends on the type of coronary anomalies and the method of transfer of the coronary arteries during surgery . however certain coronary patterns in transposition of great vessels like a retropulmonary looping of left coronary artery ( lca ) or an intramural coronary artery predict increased morbidity and mortality .
this case report highlights importance of identifying coronary artery stenosis in the perioperative period of congenital heart disease patients , which may go unnoticed in the absence of high degree of clinical suspicion .
it is said that aso surgeries are at a low risk for myocardial ischemia , and much depends on the type of coronary anomalies and the method of transfer of thecoronary arteries during surgery .
it also reiterates that although post - aso surgery patients are considered as at a low risk for ischemia , there is increased mortality and morbidity , especially in patients with additional anomalies such as transposition of great vessels such as retropulmonary looping of left coronary artery .
