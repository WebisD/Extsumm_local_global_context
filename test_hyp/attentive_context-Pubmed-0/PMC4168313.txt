frequency of fish consumption and intake of fat are positive determinants of vitamin d intake , while % tbf and household net income are inversely associated with vitamin d intake .
table 2 presents the median values and the 5th and 95th percentiles of the daily intake levels of the nine food groups , the corresponding absolute vitamin d intake by these food groups , and the relative contributions of the food groups to the daily vitamin d intake . for some of the food groups ( eggs , potatoes / fruits / vegetables , nutriments , meat / meat products , and others ) , median values for their contribution to vitamin d intake amounted to zero
fish / fish products contributed less to the vitamin d intake of subjects with a monthly household net income of 1,500  compared to subjects who reported a lower income , whereas in the upper income group , a higher percentage of dietary vitamin d was provided by the food category 
the exclusion of two people with very high dietary vitamin d intake levels ( 26 and 37 g / day ) provided approximately equivalent results .
daily intake levels of food groups and corresponding vitamin d intake ( n=235 ) stratifying our analysis by age ( < 76 vs. 76 years ) , vitamin d status tended to be higher in younger subjects compared to older subjects ( median : 65.2 vs. 61.2
