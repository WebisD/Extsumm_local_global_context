of all included variables ( age , diabetes , hypertension , pad , previous cabg , myocardial infarction , left ventricular function , baseline creatinine , and hemoglobin and amount of contrast dye ) only age was found to be significantly associated with aki in univariate analysis and was detected as an independent predictor of aki in multivariate analysis ( or 0.93 , ci 0.870.99 , p = 0.03 ) . including vascular access site in the model ,
therefore , we sought to assess the incidence of aki , search for its predictors , and analyze its impact on 30-day as well as midterm outcome in a sizeable group of consecutive patients undergoing tavi .
transapical approach was also a significant predictor of aki ( or 1.8 , ci 1.8518.4 , p = 0.003 ) .
mortality in aki pts . was even higher ( hrr 3.8 , ci 1.3710.37 , p = 0.01 , figure 1(b ) ) after adjusting for risk factors ( age , diabetes , pad , hypertension , previous myocardial infarction and cabg , left ventricular dysfunction , amount of contrast dye , baseline creatinine , and hemoglobin ) .
both , 30-day - mortality ( 29% versus 7% , p < 0.0001 ) and cumulative mortality after a median followup of 309 days were significantly higher in aki patients ( 43% versus 18% , p < 0.0001 ) .
