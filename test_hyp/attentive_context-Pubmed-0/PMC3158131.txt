i squeeze into the back , next to the two community - owned resource persons ( corp ) and a tanzanian phd student under the supervision of the principal investigator of the urban malaria control programme ( umcp ) .
i use the term value , broadly to describe both the moral virtues of knowledge - production and the monetary costs of malaria control .
the theoretical consequences of immobility i leave for the conclusion where i briefly consider the hlc as a counterweight to the  project form of humanitarian engagement ( boltanski & chiapello 2005 ) . in presenting this particular account of these dynamics ,
the malaria investigated here is defined by ecological and administrative specificity  relations that lie outside the current figuration of malaria as a threat to the global economy .
of particular interest is the relationship between the hlc as knowledge - producer and the transformation of dar es salaam into a venue for disease management .
drawing on theoretical resources from anthropology , science and technology studies and economic sociology , this paper examines how political , economic , and scientific logics are inter - articulated through public health research practice .
i point to different alignments of knowledge , work , science and place and suggest how these shape the value of research .
