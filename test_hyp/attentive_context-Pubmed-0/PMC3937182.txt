we have previously completed a similar assessment of patient requirements for dietician services in primary care.4 while commonly used approaches to identify patients for pharmacist care include physician referrals , drug- or disease - specific programs ( eg , chronic disease management ) , and patients recently discharged from hospital , an alternative strategy is to focus on patients at increased risk of medication - related problems ( mrps).2,57 mrps are events or circumstances involving drug therapy that actually , or potentially , interfere with an optimum outcome for the patient.8,9 several studies have identified factors associated with an increased risk of mrps,1014 and short , self - administered surveys have been developed to help identify patients at risk of mrps.12,15 our objective was to determine the feasibility of using a locally adapted , self - administered , paper - based , patient survey , to identify patients at risk of mrps , in a convenience sample of patients at a single academic family medicine clinic .
pharmacists embedded in primary care medical practices , such as those modeled on the patient - centered medical home , are playing increasing roles in interdisciplinary primary healthcare teams.13 however , with limited pharmacist resources and high patient to pharmacist ratios , it is important to identify which patients would benefit most from consultation with a primary care pharmacist .
