the present manuscript sought to exploit dab photo - oxidation of mag - fura 2 for visualizing er ca distribution in hela cells , which are among the most widespread model cell lines used for studying intracellular ca signaling .
the technique utilizes the photo - oxidation of diaminobenzidine ( dab ) in presence of the emission of an excited fluorochrome , and it has been shown to be efficient on different dyes and conditions .
this method combines the specificity of available fluorophores to the high spatial resolution offered by transmission em to detect fluorescing molecules even when present in low amounts in membrane - bounded organelles .
, this approach could provide important qualitative information about the amount and sub - cellular distribution of calcium ions both in cultured cells and , more importantly , in ex vivo samples , which are far less amenable to high resolution ca imaging of er ca levels .
an important amount of precipitates were found in the cell and especially in the nucleus ; our method gives a much finer end product , and this allows a superior resolution and localization . in conclusion , this method is a reliable and efficient technique for stabilizing and visualizing ca ions at em .
