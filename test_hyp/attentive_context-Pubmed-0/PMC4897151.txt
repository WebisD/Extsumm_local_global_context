the use of rich but nonselective media for isolation of bacillus strains capable of eps - production leads to isolation of pga producers capable of producing only high molecular weight , polydisperse , viscous pga as constituent .
the amount and viscosity of pga produced depend on the relative amylase : protease activity and use of specific medium constituents and pga was even produced in presence of mixed substrates .
these isolates are glutamic acid independent pga producers which do not produce exopolysaccharide and thus are superior for pga production to the other wild type or genetically engineered bacillus strains reported earlier in literature .
the strains isolated and used in the present study however are not glutamic acid dependent for their ability to produce only pga type of eps and are not affected even in presence of glutamic acid or glutamine , in solid media and broth media containing various substrates and are thus suitable for low cost pga production .
pga obtained from isolate t was subjected to varying shear stress and as expected , with an increase in shear rate the viscosity of pga decreased ( thinning effect of non - newtonian polymer solutions ) .
morphologically , the colonies were irregular and mucoid and microscopic observation showed presence of gram positive rods in chains or single , and at a definite stage in growth cycle the cells also showed presence of endospores and capsule .
