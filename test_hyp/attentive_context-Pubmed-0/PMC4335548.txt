totally 162 s. aureus isolates were collected from clinical specimens of patients admitted to three university hospitals with 462 , 420 and 300 bed capacities in kerman , south - east of iran , from march 2011 to february 2012 .
the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of inducible clindamycin resistance in s. aureus isolates collected from clinical specimens in this geographic area .
therefore , d - test should be performed to prevent treatment failures of s. aureus infections caused by the agents that are resistant to erythromycin and sensitive to clindamycin .
from 162 s. aureus isolates tested for determination of inducible clindamycin resistance , 70 ( 43.2% ) were mssa and 92 ( 56.8% ) isolates were mrsa ( table 1 ) .
resistance to methicillin , erythromycin and clindamycin was observed in 92 ( 56.8% ) , 75 ( 46.29% ) and 46 ( 28.4% ) of the isolates , respectively .
confirmation of s. aureus isolates and detection of methicillin resistant s. aureus ( mrsa ) were performed by phenotypic and genotypic methods as previously described ( 6 ) . only one isolate per patient
inducible resistance to clindamycin was determined in 14 ( 8.64% ) isolates ( d - test positive , figure 1 ) .
