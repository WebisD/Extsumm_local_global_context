the rapidly aging population drives an increase in the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , which in turn contributes to an explosion of vascular dementia ( vad ) and alzheimer s disease ( ad ) .
2006 ) , a comprehensive psgt approach was developed . since the deleterious effects of several genetic risk factors shared between cvd and ad are mediated through diet and lifestyle factors , identification of a genetic predisposition
research efforts are increasingly focused on elucidation of the underlying cause of ad , which has resulted in significant progress in understanding the wide range of both genetic and environmental risk factors that converge into the development and progression of this common neurodegenerative disease .
highlights the importance of smoking cessation where relevant and a healthy diet with regular intake of foods that offer neuroprotection .
genetic testing of cvd risk factors has the potential to translate into improved health outcomes in patients with cognitive impairment and their at - risk family members . based on the knowledge that assessment and treatment of cvd risk factors in middle age may reduce the risk of heart disease and dementia in old age ( kotze et al .
