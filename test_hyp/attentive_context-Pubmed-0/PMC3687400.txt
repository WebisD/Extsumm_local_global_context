the beginning of the symptomatic disease as a left - sided renal colic is , in itself , a previously unreported case .
the existence of gastric cancer metastasis to the ureter has been described twice in the literature to date .
a female patient , age 67 , was diagnosed at the district hospital ( 22.04 - 30.04.2010 ) because of intensified symptoms of left - sided renal colic . based on the conducted usg and single - phase computed tomography tests of the abdominal cavity and the pelvis , dilation of the ureter
this poor result is determined by the fact that it is rarely ( only in around 8% ) detected in the form of early gastric cancer , in the mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic phase . in most patients
treatment of gastric cancer in the disseminated phase of the disease aims at extension of life and achieving a good palliative effect .
the dissemination of a neoplasm with extremely rarely encountered symptomatology described above is an interesting experience which we wanted to share .
gastric cancer is the second most frequent neoplasm of the alimentary tract after the large intestine .
it seems that the operative procedure conducted in the presented patient allowed a good palliative effect to be achieved along with loss of severe colic and maintenance of kidney function .
