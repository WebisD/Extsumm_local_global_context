a rct is ongoing to answer the question whether active treatment can improve the outcome of patients with uia as compared with observation .
two - hundred - fifty of 1,063 ( 23.5% ) patients allocated to endovascular coiling were dead or dependent at 1 year , compared with 326 of 1,055 ( 30.9% ) patients allocated to surgical clipping : an absolute risk reduction of 7.4% ( 95% ci 3.6% to 11.2% , p = 0.0019 ) .
endovascular occlusion with detachable platinum coils has become an established treatment for managing patients who have ruptured intracranial aneurysms ( 1 - 3 ) .
the procedure - related mortality rate was 2% in the endovascular group and 4% in the surgical group .
thus , isat study has demonstrated that endovascular coiling of ruptured intracranial aneurysms has benefits over surgical clipping in those patients suitable for either treatment , but this difference decreases over time . because rct comparing conservative management with surgical clipping and with endovascular coiling have not been performed to date for unruptured intracranial aneurysms ,
the results of the first , prospective randomized trial from finland compared endovascular and surgical treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms was published in 1999 and 2000 ( 4 , 5 ) .
