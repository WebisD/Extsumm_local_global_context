and our study provided the normative data on k1 , k2 , |k1  k2| , average corneal power ( k ) , al , al / cr , and cec of this population ; those were 43.74  1.64  d , 44.75  1.68  d , 1.02  0.86  d , 44.24  1.60  d , 23.04  1.49  mm , 3.03  0.12 , and 2462.36  423.65/mm , respectively .
the corneal power k1 , corneal power k2 , and k ( average corneal power ) are not with normal distribution
this indicated that in rural chinese population at least in the cataract patients the al / cr ratio , in other words , the spherical equivalent , had less effect on the visual acuity than |k1  k2| , the corneal astigmatism . in conclusion , this study provides normative ocular biometry in a large , representative rural chinese population .
the difference between k1 and k2 could be used to indicate the corneal astigmatism , which has the effect on the postoperative visual acuity . in figure 1 and tables 3 , 4 , and 5 ,
average corneal power ( k ) is an important parameter to calculate the power of iol . in figure 1 and tables 3 , 4 , and 5 , the patients in zhoukou had lower average corneal power ( k ) significantly compared with the other two groups , the same for male and female patients in zhoukou .
