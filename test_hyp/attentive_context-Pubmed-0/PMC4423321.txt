we propose a simple and widely available measure to improve the visibility of the submucosal space when bleeding occurs during esd : polyethylene glycol ( peg ) irrigation .
endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) has been developed to enable the endoluminal en bloc resection of superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms , thus producing an adequate specimen for a reliable histologic assessment .
a 70-year - old man was referred to kobe university hospital , kobe , japan , for endoscopic treatment of a laterally spreading tumor ( lst ) in the left side of the colon .
, we propose a novel use for peg during endoscopic procedures , aimed at cleaning the submucosal space of blood clots and improving visibility for submucosal dissection whenever bleeding occurs and can not be controlled promptly .
esd still is a challenging and time - consuming procedure . in order to promote the widespread availability of esd , measures to facilitate and standardize the procedure
one of the main problems associated with esd is hemorrhage control 4 
 5 , and a correct vascular approach is key to preventing bleeding and improving the submucosal dissection 6 
 7 .
further studies are required to reproduce our experience in a large number of patients and to confirm the reliability of this approach .
