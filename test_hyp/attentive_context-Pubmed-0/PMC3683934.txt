to reduce the risk of in - stent thrombosis and restenosis and to sustain the development of new coatings for drug - eluting stents , an easy , simple and accessible method of stent implantation in an animal model is needed .
the development of a miniaturized nitinol stent for mouse carotid artery , allows the study of precise molecular mechanisms induced by stent implantation and offers the possibility to test quickly and efficiently the effects of different drug - coatings to prevent restenosis .
moreover , the existence of different knock - out mice strains represents a huge advantage in clarifying the role of different molecules involved in neointima growth and in - stent thrombosis .
the study of these complex molecular mechanisms in larger animals or in mouse aortic artery is a very difficult procedure , offering limited data . to test the efficiency of novel stent - coatings to reduce in - stent thrombosis and restenosis new models are imperative .
nitinol represents the ideal platform for stents because of its ' high elasticity , shape - memory effect and good tolerance in patients , being successfully used as bare - metal stents in clinical use .
