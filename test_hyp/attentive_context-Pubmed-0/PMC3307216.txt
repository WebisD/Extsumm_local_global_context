we describe a rare case in which extraosseous bone scan tracer accumulation was noted in a renal calculus .
our case demonstrates a rare occurrence of extraosseous bone tracer accumulation in a renal calculus .
bone scintigraphy is a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with a variety of osseous abnormalities
a 60-year - old man , who had difficulty in passing urine for the past 6 months and a complaint of lower back pain presented to our department . on ultrasound imaging , he was found to have an enlarged prostate .
the purpose of bone scintigraphy is to portray areas of new bone formation within the skeleton .
since approximately half of the administered radioisotope is excreted through renal filtration , abnormalities of the urinary system are also frequently noted during bone scintigraphy . in such cases , to reach an accurate diagnosis , the interpreting physician must first recognize which structures are involved in the uptake and the significance of the uptake .
localization of bone scan tracer in a renal calculus has been reported in the past and its use in preoperative in vivo localization of the renal calculus has been explored .
this is useful in imaging reaction of bone to tumor , fracture , and infection .
