a 72-year - old man presented with a two - week history of a red painful right eye .
the culture of stenotrophomonas maltophilia from the third corneal abscess was feasible because this is an opportunistic organism and infections typically occur in patients with compromised ocular surface and trauma.4,5 it has been reported previously in patients following penetrating keratoplasty.3,6,7 this is the first case report of acanthamoeba keratitis occurring in a contact lens wearer with preceding protozoal and bacterial keratitis
this patient had acanthamoeba keratitis secondary to contact lens wear and then developed three episodes of bacterial keratitis .
the initial bacterial infection in this patient presumably was facilitated by the underlying acanthamoeba keratitis and the use of corticosteroids.2,3 the presence of synthetic fibrils on the ulcer base presumably contributed to the infection recurrences by acting as a nidus for organisms and by interfering with corneal healing .
. the characteristically resistant antibiogram of s. maltophilia may limit the therapeutic options . fortunately in this patient treatment
it is noteworthy that the cornea finally healed with no further infections once the patient was instructed not to wipe his eye with a paper tissue .
five months after initial diagnosis he complained of a one - day history of a painful right eye .
