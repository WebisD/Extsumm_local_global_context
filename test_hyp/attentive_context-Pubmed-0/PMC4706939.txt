this study demonstrates the utility of gabrd mice in investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms of postpartum depression and implicates hyperexcitability of the hpa axis in postpartum depression - like behavior and the negative impact on offspring development .
further , our data suggest a role for hpa axis dysfunction in mediating the negative impact of maternal mood on offspring behavior .
this study highlights the utility of a unique mouse model to investigate the underlying mechanisms mediating the pathophysiology of postpartum depression and the mechanism(s ) through which postpartum depression negatively impacts offspring development .
if altered stress reactivity in gabrd mothers plays a role in the impact of maternal depression - like behaviors on offspring development , we hypothesized that inhibiting the stress response in the mother with the corticotropin - releasing hormone ( crh ) antagonist , antalarmin , would decrease the anxiety- and depression - like behaviors in the juvenile offspring ( figure 5(a ) ) .
consistent with a role for hpa axis hyperresponsiveness in postpartum depression - like behaviors , this study supports a role for elevated corticosterone in the pathophysiology of postpartum mood disorders , since physiological stress is sufficient to induce depression - like behavior during the postpartum period in mice ( figure 3 ) .
