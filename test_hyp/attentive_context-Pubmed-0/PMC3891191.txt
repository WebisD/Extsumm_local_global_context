prescribing guideline is required to reduce the prevalent poly - pharmacy and to promote appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs based on the culture and sensitivity report .
, we have evaluated the drug utilization pattern and calculated the ddd for the drugs used in ccu of a tertiary care hospital .
the total cost of treatment in medical + surgical indications was significantly higher than patients with medical and surgical indication alone ( p < 0.05 ) .
ddd/100 bed - days provide a rough estimate of drug consumption in hospital inpatients and it is a fixed unit of measurement independent of formulation and price . in the present study
the antimicrobials and inotropes were used in 375 ( 94.45% ) and 285 ( 71.79% ) patients respectively .
comparisons of the total number of drugs prescribed per patient ; duration of ccu stay ; and cost of total treatment , antimicrobials and inotropes per patient were performed using the kruskal - wallis test followed by dunn 's multiple comparison test between patients admitted with medical , surgical and medical + surgical indications .
comparison of the total number of drugs , duration of ccu stay in days , total cost per patient , antimicrobials cost per patient and inotropes drugs cost per patient between patient admitted with medical , surgical and medical+surgical indications comparison of the total number of drugs , duration of ccu stay in days , total cost per patient , antimicrobials cost per patient and inotropes drugs cost per patient between survived and expired cases
