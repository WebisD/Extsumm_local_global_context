the benefits of the data explosion far outweigh the risks for the careful researcher . as target populations subdivide along combinations of comorbid conditions and countless genetic polymorphisms , as diagnostic and monitoring device including wearable sensors become more ubiquitous , and as therapeutic options expand beyond the evaluation of individual interventions including drugs and procedures , it is clear that the traditional approach to knowledge discovery can not scale to match the exponential growth of medical complexity . rather than taking turns hyping and disparaging big data , we need organizations and researchers to create methods and processes that address some of our most pressing concerns , e.  g. , who is in  charge of shared data , who 
owns clinical data , and how do we best combine heterogeneous and superficially non - interoperable data sources ? we need to use big data in a different way than we have traditionally used data  collaboratively . by creating a culture of transparency and reproducibility
clinical data have been notorious for their variable interoperability and quality , but a holistic use of the massive data sources available ( vital signs , clinical notes , laboratory results , treatments including medications and procedures ) can lead to new perspectives on challenging problems .
