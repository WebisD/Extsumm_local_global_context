this is of importance , because of the growing popularity of these cements due to their better physical and mechanical properties.11 the purpose of this study therefore was to assess , evaluate and compare the effect of desensitizing laser treatment on the bond strength of self - adhesive resin cement to glass - ionomer luting cement .
within the limitations of this in vitro study the following conclusions were drawn : 
 glass - ionomer luting cement showed a statistically significant reduction in the tensile bond strength values after desensitizing laser treatment at 0.5 w for 15 s duration to prepared teeth as compared to the control group.tensile bond strength of self - adhesive resin luting cement showed a marginal increase in values after desensitizing laser application , which was not statistically significant.since combination of er , cr : ysgg laser for desensitization of dentin and the self - adhesive resin cement for luting crowns showed a marginal increase in bond strength values after laser application , these crowns could be recommended for luting crowns in laser treated abutments.scanning electronic microscopic study revealed that application of the er , cr : ysgg laser at a power of 0.5 w for 15 s to exposed dentinal surface resulted in obliteration of dentinal tubules and formation of a smear layer formed by dentinal debris , which possibly describes the desensitizing property of lasers .
