this review of peer - reviewed literature was conducted to evaluate the cumulative state of knowledge related to toothbrush contamination , its possible role in disease transmission , and in preparation for a research study related to toothbrush contamination in critically ill adults .
articles published from 1977 to 2011 , on human subjects and using the english language were obtained .
the review included studies that evaluated toothbrush contamination in healthy and oral - diseased adults , guidelines for toothbrush and oral care in both healthy and medically ill persons , hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients , and interventions for reducing contamination of toothbrushes .
there is a need for standardized nursing guidelines to prevent toothbrush contamination , which may increase the risk of infections from potentially pathogenic microorganisms and is clinically relevant for assessing the risks and benefits of oral care and informing nursing practice .
after a review of the abstracts for the articles obtained through the three searches , a total of 88 relevant articles were identified for further evaluation .
for example , several of the articles combined an in vivo examination of bacterial survival on actual patient 's toothbrushes and then conducted an in vitro autoinoculation experiment to examine decontamination methods on sterile toothbrushes in the laboratory .
