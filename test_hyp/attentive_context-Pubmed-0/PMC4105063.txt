we used coarse - grained ( cg ) simulations with 
 the martini force field of a broad sampling of the peptide 
 dimer and lipid / surfactant ensemble .
our results suggest the dpc micelle 
 environment suppresses interactions mediated by gxxxg repeats in the 
 tm region , leading to an x - shaped structure that best satisfies the 
 boundaries of the surfactant / solvent interface . in this way ,
dimerization results in little change in helix stability in the popc 
 bilayer , but a measurable decrease in helix stability is observed 
 in the dpc micelle . although the dimer ensemble in either environment 
 is characterized by multiple conformational states , the dominant structures 
 observed in our simulations in both the dpc micelle and popc bilayer 
 are consistently right - handed coiled - coil structures , supporting the 
 conclusions of earlier experimental and 
 computational studies .
our model is benchmarked against the well - studied glycophorin a 
 ( gpa ) dimer and used to develop novel predictions for the c991555 dimer . following the identification of the 
 predominant structural states 
 through cg simulations , representative conformations in all - atom
molecular 
 dynamics simulations were used to refine the atomistic structure and 
 characterize the detailed peptide  peptide , peptide
