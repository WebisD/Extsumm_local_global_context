tnf - a*11 and tnf-*10 alleles increased significantly in patients with ms ( 0.25 , p < 0.005 and 0.19 ,
considering the significant differences between the tnf- microsatellite polymorphism gene in patients with ms and healthy controls in europeans , we studied the role of tnf- genotype in ms by determining the correlation between the tnf- microsatellite located in the hla region and ms in patients of two southern provinces of iran ( hormozgan and fars ) .
the heterozygosity for the tnf- microsatellite gene was particularly high in this study ( 0.8 ) ; the tnf- genotypes in studied population were in hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( p = 0.002 for cases and p = 0.05 for controls ) .
in contrast , tnf-*1 and tnf-*2 allele frequencies decreased in patients ( 0.01 and 0.02 respectively , p < 0.005 ) , compared to hcs ( 0.15 and 0.21 , p < 0.005 ) .
the findings indicated the association between tnf- microsatellite polymorphism in the hla region and the risk of developing ms in the native iranian population .
our study was performed in a case - control design consisting of 163 people ( 81 patients with ms and 82 hcs ) .
