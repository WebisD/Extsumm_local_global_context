ours is a case of a tumor in the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands diagnosed as emc , having clinical and histological resemblance to cellular pa .

there have been reports suggesting co - existence of another malignancy , like adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ad cc ) with emc , in the same tumor .

long - term follow - up is needed for detection of early signs of recurrence and proper management .
the present case report is about a 61-year - old woman who reported to us with a growth in the floor of mouth that gradually increased in size since last 3 years , without pain . on examination , a 3 cm  2.5 cm
furthermore , there have been reports describing emc ex pa in parotid gland with the histological picture similar to ours . within the characteristic dual cell picture of emc ,
