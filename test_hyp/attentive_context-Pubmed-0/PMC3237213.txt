we report a case of post transplant xpn in the native adpkd kidney presenting as relapsing uti .
18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg)-positron emission computerized tomography ( pet / ct ) scan allowed the exact localization of the infection in the renal parenchyma and guided the therapeutic procedure with subsequent resolution of uti .
this case highlights the rare occurrence of xpn as a cause of post transplant uti , especially in the absence of obstruction or stone disease .
urinary tract infection ( uti ) is the most common infection contracted by renal allograft recipients . in patients of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( adpkd )
here , we report a case of rare occurrence of xpn in native polycystic kidney of a renal allograft recipient . in the literature ,
a 53-year - old male of adpkd - ckd on maintenance hemodialysis since one and half years received a deceased donor renal transplant at our institute .
fdg pet / ct imaging is a valuable tool in both localization and subsequent planning of therapeutic interventions for complicated utis associated with adpkd transplant patients .
post transplant , uti especially in the adpkd patients is challenging to the transplant physician .
