our laboratory has focused on studying the health effects of exposure of humans to some common sources of electromagnetic fields such as mobile phones ( 1012 ) , mri ( 13 ) and possible implications of pre - exposure to radiofrequency radiations ( 1416 ) .
these results may lead us to this conclusion that occupational exposure to radar radiations decreases reaction time , which may lead to a better response to different hazards . on the other hand , the scores of forward digit span , backward digit span , word recognition and paired words in radar workers were significantly lower than those of the control group ( 3.56 + / 0.77 vs. 4.29 + / 1.06 , p<0.0001 ; 2.70 + / 0.69 vs. 3.62 + / 0.95 , p<0.0001 ; 3.37 + / 1.13 vs 5.86 + / 1.11 , p<0.0001 ; 13.56 + / 1.78 vs. 15.21 + / 2.20 , p<0.0001 , respectively ) .
findings of reaction time in this study generally confirm the findings of our previous study that indicated exposure to mobile phone radiations caused decreased reaction time in university students ( 12 ) . generally speaking , our findings are in contrast with those of other investigators who have reported detrimental health effects of the occupational exposure to radar radiations such as decreased sperm motility and viability in highly exposed group compared to those of the lowly exposed and control groups ( 19 ) , increased sperm dysmorphia and alteration in quality of semen in response to changes in microwave frequency , distance , intensity , exposure time and quality of shielding ( 20 ) , increase in frequency of micronuclei ( 21 ) . on the other hand
