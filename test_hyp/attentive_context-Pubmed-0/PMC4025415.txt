the aim of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strength and failure sites of two types of nano - composites in comparison to the conventional orthodontic composite adhesive system , and evaluate the possibility of their clinical application in bonding orthodontic brackets .
overall , it can be concluded that the failure sites of transbond xt and nano - composites is mainly at the tooth - adhesive interface . considering the results of this study and bishara`s study , successful application of nano - composites
multiple comparisons revealed that the shear bond strength of aelite aesthetic enamel was significantly higher than the other two groups ( p<0.001 ) , whilst there was not a statistically significant difference between transbond xt and filtek tm supreme xt ( p=0.453 ) .
one - way anova test showed statistically significant differences between the shear bond strengths of the three groups(p= 0.019 ) .
three groups of brackets were bonded using the following systems : the first group was bonded using a conventional orthodontic composite :  transbond xt ( 3 m unitek , usa)and transbond xt primer  . for the second group , a nano - filled bonding and composite ; adpertm single bond and filtektm supreme xt ( 3 m espe , usa ) was used . in the third group ,
