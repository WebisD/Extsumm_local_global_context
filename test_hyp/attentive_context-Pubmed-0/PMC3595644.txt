accordingly , we conducted a qualitative study on the oncologists experiences in end - of - life care for end stage cancer patients in iran to clarify ethical challenges experienced by them in an islamic middle eastern setting .
besides , as our care providers are not involved in teamwork for end of life care , they can not share information and understand their responsibilities . according to the results of our study , there is a need for good planning in regards with terminal cancer which requires improvement of physicians communication skills , provision of appropriate services for end of life care , developing multidisciplinary team working and optimal insurance system .
finally , the results of the present study can help policymaker to develop a guideline for ethical decision making and set educational priorities for physician working in this field .
the other proposed reason for challenges our physicians are faced with is unequal availability of end of life care services and financial problems that exist in iran health care setting when it is medically indicated .
the aim of this sampling method was to gather the perspectives of a group of specialists who were involved in taking care of terminal patients and providing them and their families with the option of palliative care .
