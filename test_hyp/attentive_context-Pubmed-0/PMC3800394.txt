we discuss the possibility that the current case is a partial expression of nbccs and briefly review the current trends in treatment of recurrent okcs associated with this syndrome .
a 23-year - old male normally fit and well reported to the outpatient department of our hospital with a chief complaint of asymptomatic swelling and pus discharge from the left maxillary posterior region since 10 days .
odontogenic keratocysts ( okcs ) are the most common form of cystic lesions affecting the maxillofacial region .
, any patient reporting with the multiple okcs should be evaluated thoroughly for the possibility of nbccs as okcs may be the first and only manifestation of this syndrome . also for the fact that okcs associated with this syndrome have higher rate of recurrence than the isolated okcs , a very strict follow up has to be followed for a long period of time .
it has a high recurrence rate , and is associated many a times with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( nbccs ) .
gorlin and goltz first described the spectrum of features associated with this syndrome in 1960 ; hence , it is also called gorlin - goltz syndrome .
