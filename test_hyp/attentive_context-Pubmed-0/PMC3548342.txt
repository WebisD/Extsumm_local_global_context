therefore , this study was taken up to measure light transmission through similar shaped dt light and dt white posts and also to evaluate the degree of polymerization of al cure resin cement cured through these posts , by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) .
the degree of polymerization of dual cure cement around the esthetic post is dependent on the intensity of light transmitted through these posts .
the light intensity decreased from cervical to apical for both the dt light post and the dt white post , but there was insignificant difference between the middle and apical third of the dt white post group .

the posts were divided into two experimental groups , that is , group a ( dt light post ) , group b ( dt white post ) , and control , that is , group c ( metal post ) .
ten posts from each group were used for evaluating light transmission and the same ten posts from each group were used for evaluating the degree of polymerization of the dual cure resin cement around different posts .
