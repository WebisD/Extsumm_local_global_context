the goal of our study was to specify the relationship between the level of activity ( intellectual , physical , and social ) in persons diagnosed with mci and the further progression of cognitive dysfunction .
our results indicate that an assessment of the level of activity can be useful in establishing a prognosis for the future course of mci .
the basis for this evaluation was our modification of the activity scale developed by christensen and mackinnon , which enabled us to evaluate three areas of activity : intellectual , physical , and social .
the patients from the two groups also had significantly different scores in the physical activity subscale and in four of the subscales of the iadl : telephone use ( iadl - tele ) , shopping ( iadl - shop ) , transportation ( iadl - tran ) , and personal finances ( iadl - pfin ) . in table 3 , the basis for dividing the subjects into two groups was the difference between the mmse scores at baseline and at the second examination ( after one year ) . based on the average difference ( 1.75 points ) , we divided the population into one group with a smaller difference ( mmse - c i  ii : s ) and one group with a greater difference ( mmse - c i  ii : g ) between the adjusted scores on the mmse - c i  ii .
