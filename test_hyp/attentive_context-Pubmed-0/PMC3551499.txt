we have applied for the first time a scientific approach to the i d error control to the construction and data analysis with the tma technology , we have validated the process of identifying the wsi of single samples / patients in the tma , setting diagnostic standards for the use of the tma .
, controlling for analytical errors in experiments in science and industry is a golden standard and we advocate the use of our solutions in all fields using the tma high throughput technology .
reports of diagnostic use of the tma , where positive identification of a patient is crucial , are scarce .
the technique is evidently assumed to be totally accurate in identifying each and every single spot ; the occurrence of tissue heterogeneity and the high - throughput ability masks and overcomes small individual error - driven experimental noise .
in 1998 kononen and colleagues published in nature medicine , the results of a high throughput analysis of tumor cases , named tissue micro array ( tma ) technology , via an ingenious substantial modification of a previous method , of transferring cores from several donor blocks into a virgin unique acceptor as replicated samples identified by the position in the rows and columns of the array .
