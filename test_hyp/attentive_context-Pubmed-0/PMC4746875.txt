more specifically , the dietary calcium ( ca ) intake of pregnant women may be associated with the bp of their infants , and ca intake is inversely correlated to systolic bp in young children .
some recent experimental and observational studies in humans and animals have reported an association between maternal ca intake during pregnancy and bp in the offspring , but others did not confirm it . we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the association of maternal ca intake either by food or supplements with bp in the offspring .
ca supplementation during pregnancy is simple and inexpensive and may be a way to reduce the risk of elevated bp and its sequels in the next generation .
we searched the databases using the following strategy : for scopus [ title - abs - key ( maternal or mother ) and title - abs - key ( calcium ) and title - abs - key ( blood pressure ) ] , and for pubmed [  others  ( mesh ) ) or maternal ) and  blood pressure(mesh ) and  dietary supplements(mesh ) ) or calcium ] .
in general , our findings confirm the association of maternal ca intake during pregnancy and offspring bp .
