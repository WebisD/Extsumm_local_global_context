also , deepening of the anterior chamber and iop decrease after topical atropine was very supportive of the diagnosis of malignant glaucoma .
in this case , the patient had a typical presentation of bilateral malignant glaucoma and her iop dropped only temporarily following laser iridotomy to rise again shortly thereafter .
malignant glaucoma , or aqueous misdirection syndrome , is a condition characterized by sudden intraocular pressure ( iop ) elevation , and it is usually unilateral and induced by ocular surgical intervention or by medical therapy . here , we report a case of simultaneous bilateral malignant glaucoma in a young patient with no history of any ocular diseases .
a case of a 24-year - old female with no apparent previous history of ocular medical or surgical conditions was referred to our hospital because of recent bilateral iop elevation associated with a severe drop in vision and shallow anterior chamber with no posterior segment anomalies detected by ocular ultrasound in both eyes .
yttrium aluminum garnet ( yag ) laser iridotomy dropped the iop only temporarily and the patient received topical atropine treatment with combined trabeculectomy and anterior vitrectomy .
this is a very rare case of bilateral malignant glaucoma in a young adult without any prior eye conditions ; only one similar case has been reported in the literature .
