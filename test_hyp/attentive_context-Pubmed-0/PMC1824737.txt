we report a case of purulent pericarditis with pericardial tamponade masquerading as septic shock related to proteus mirabilis septic arthritis .
septic arthritis is a well recognized occurrence in patients with steroid dependent rheumatoid arthritis.1 treatment includes broad - spectrum antibiotics usually accompanied by surgical or needle drainage of the joint.2 while pericardial effusions are common in patients with rheumatologic disorders , the development of purulent pericarditis with pericardial tamponade is rare .
a 53-year - old man with long - standing , steroid - dependent rheumatoid arthritis complained of a painful , swollen , left elbow with purulent drainage emanating from what appeared to be a small ulceration .
this would include the need for the administration of intravenous broad - spectrum antibiotics with surgical lavage and debridement of the infected space .
this case also underscores the importance of appropriate antibiotic selection in the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with infected prosthetic joints .
in the setting of an infected joint prosthesis , fever , and immunosuppression , this patient s hemodynamic instability was initially ascribed to septic shock and not to pericardial tamponade .
is rare and has been previously reported in association with pneumonia4 and coronary bypass surgery.5 septic arthritis leading to pericardial infection is equally uncommon .
