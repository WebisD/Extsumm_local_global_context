table 2 shows an increased prevalence of this species in individuals with chronic periodontitis , compared to healthy individuals and individuals with gingivitis , which is not a statistical significant difference .

 c. dubliniensis is a yeast species that is characterized by its in vitro resistance to the antifungal azole group in hiv patients , for their capacity to adhere in vitro to human buccal epithelial cells and other microorganisms in the oral microbiota , as well as the high proteinase activity ( 9 , 15 , 37 , 38 ) .
the rapd - based typing was used to assess the diversity of candida species isolates , as it has been described as a simple , rapid , and reliable discriminatory method for clinical epidemiological studies of oral candida infections ( 17 , 23 , 24 , 27 , 35 ) . in spite of this , and considering the reproducibility pitfalls of the rapd method , it was considered adequate to compare the reliability of the rapd - based clustering with that obtained with pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis , referred to as a more robust method ( 20 , 23 , 55 ) . in the present study ,
