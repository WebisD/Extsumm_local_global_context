myocardial infarction ( mi ) , and subsequent reperfusion injury , is the most common and clinically significant form of acute cardiac injury and results in the ischemic death of cardiomyocytes.1,2 among the pathological mechanisms underlying myocardial ischemia / reperfusion ( mi / r ) injury , inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration , together with the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses , are the hallmark of mi and reperfusion injury.3,4 ischemic cardiac injury activates the innate immune response via toll - like receptor ( tlr)-mediated pathways and upregulates the chemokine and cytokine syntheses in the infarcted heart .
timely resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and spatial containment of the inflammatory and reparative response into the infarcted area are essential for optimal infarct healing . for instance , targeting proinflammatory leukocyte subsets , to dampen detrimental inflammation while sparing the wound healing roles of the anti - inflammatory monocytes / macrophages , may reduce cardiomyocyte injury and adverse remodeling . despite the challenges ahead , we are hopeful that new therapies for myocardial ischemia and reperfusion will soon be integrated into clinical practice .
tlrs , which are expressed by inflammatory cells and also on endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes , can recognize endogenous danger signals released during cell death following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.5,6 a growing body of evidence suggests that modulating tlr activation may enhance the benefits and blunt the negative effects of the inflammatory response , providing new therapeutic options for preventing mi / r injury.6 chemokines stimulate the chemotactic recruitment of inflammatory cells into the infarct .
