bds is studied to conform its suitability to use for boundary data generation with different phantom configurations which are required to assess the eit inverse solvers .
therefore , it is quite confusing to identify the source of the errors responsible for poor image quality in a 2d - eit system . in order to overcome the difficulties and limitations of practical and mesh phantoms , a matlab - based boundary data simulator ( bds )
bds is an absolute 2d data simulator which is required to generate the errorless 2d boundary data to study and modify the inverse solver of a 2d eit system . as the bds is a computer program , it is free from the instrumentation errors and allows us to generate voltage profile with different types of phantom geometry , inhomogeneity and background conductivity profile , and inhomogeneity geometry ( shape , size , and position ) .
bds is a software - based versatile boundary data simulator which generates boundary data suitable for studying the reconstruction algorithm required for several eit systems , and hence it is better suited for assessing the performance of the inverse solver of 2d electrical impedance tomography .
the voltage data developed by a three - dimensional current conduction are collected form surface electrodes connected to an analog instrumentation .
