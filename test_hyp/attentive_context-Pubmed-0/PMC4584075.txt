according to the results of this study , it seems intranasal calcitonin can effectively improve qol of women with low bone density via improving in bone density and bmd and also decreasing bone turnover .
this study aimed to evaluate the effect of nasal calcitonin on qol in postmenopause women with lbd .
the changes in hr - qol domains score during the study were assessed according to the bmd changes and we found that only t - score of spine s bmd and total t - score s changes were significantly correlated with the hr - qol total score changes ( p = 0.003 and p = 0.028 , respectively ) . by using the multivariate analysis , we adjusted the changes in the score of hr - qol domains regarding to the role of demographic variables and we found that only changes in mh score were significantly correlated with total bmd score changes ( p = 0.037 ) , bp score was significantly correlated with bmi ( p = 0.049 ) and rp score was also significantly correlated with bmi and age at menopause ( p = 0.009 and p = 0.013 , respectively ) .
previously , the therapeutic effects of calcitonin on ops and lbd were investigated by using bmd ( 9 ) .
