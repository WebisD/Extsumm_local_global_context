it is imperative , therefore , to determine urine abnormalities and its relationship with parasite density in children with p. falciparum infection in a resource - limited malaria - endemic setting .
malaria ranks among the major health and developmental challenges facing some of the poorest countries in the tropical and sub - tropical region across the globe.1 an estimated 3.3 billion people were at risk of malaria in 2010 , although of all geographical regions , population living in sub - saharan africa have the highest risk of acquiring malaria ; in 2010 , 81% of the cases and 91% of the deaths are estimated to have occurred in the world health organization ( who ) african region with children under 5 years of age and pregnant women being most severely affected.2 in ghana , malaria is one of the leading causes of mortality in children under 5 years.3 similarly , studies have indicated that about 3.5 million people suffer from malaria every year , and approximately 20,000 children die from malaria annually with 25% of the deaths occurring in children under the age of 5 years.4 urine analysis remains the most valuable and highly important means of diagnosis in clinical medicine , as it helps to detect many diseases even before symptoms appear.1 liver dysfunction and renal impairment have been reported in severe malaria infections,56 and these observations led to the suggestion that malaria infection may have a significant effect on urine composition.1 studies conducted in nigeria and sudan examined urinary abnormalities among the general population with malaria infection and reported parasite density using the semi - quantitative ( plus ) system instead of the standard quantitative system.17 however , studies on urinary abnormalities in plasmodium falciparum infection , and the extent to which the degree of malaria parasitemia affects urinary composition in ghanaian children remains scarce . considering the endemicity of malaria in ghana , and the associated mortality and morbidity , particularly in children and pregnant women , accurate diagnosis and proper management are very necessary .
