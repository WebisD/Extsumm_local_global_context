podocyturia ( figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) ) was present in 11 out of 29 ( 38% ) patients with preeclampsia / eclampsia , 3 out of 9 ( 33% ) with chronic and gestational htn , and 3 out of 6 ( 50% ) with gestational dm and type i / ii dm ( table 2 ) . among patients categorized as 
the negative predictive value , however , was poor for preeclampsia at 51% , as compared with 83% and 91% for htn of any type and dm of any type , respectively .
the positive predictive value was 57% for preeclampsia , as compared with 15% for both htn of any type and dm of any type .
, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of podocyturia for preeclampsia to be 38% and 70% , as compared to women of htn of any type , in whom it was 33% and 66% , respectively ( table 3 ) .
we sought to study the use of podocyturia to diagnose preeclampsia and differentiate it from other conditions that may have a similar presentation in a high risk pregnancy population .

 we recruited two groups of patients all 18 years of age : uncomplicated pregnant subjects ( control group ) and women at risk for pregnancy complications ( high - risk group ) as described below from the obstetric inpatient service at jacobi medical center , bronx , ny , usa . random urine samples
