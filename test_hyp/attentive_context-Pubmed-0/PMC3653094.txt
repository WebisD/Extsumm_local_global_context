, mutations in tnni2 , tnnt3 , tpm2 , and myh3 have been shown to cause shs ( 6 ) . in this study , we present for the first time a korean family with two generations of shs , resulting from a rare tpm2 mutation , who manifested the facial features , short stature , and da typical of shs .
sheldon - hall syndrome ( shs , mim # 601680 ) , or distal arthrogryposis ( da ) type 2b , is a rare autosomal dominant , inherited arthrogryposis syndrome characterized by congenital contractures of two or more different body areas , with no primary neurological disease .
progressive motor weakness is also possible , and associated feeding problems may lead to a sudden deterioration of the clinical condition , as in our infant patient .
we studied a family in which shs affected two individuals , a mother and her daughter .
shs is distinguished as a separate entity from freeman - sheldon syndrome ( fss , da type 2a , mim # 193700 ) , another da type 2 syndrome , because fss includes striking contractures of the orofacial muscles and is a more severe da than shs ( 2 ) .
