congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations ( ccam ) of lung are rare congenital cystic lung lesions that arise from excessive proliferation of tubular bronchial structures .
it is a rare lesion with incidence of 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 35,000 pregnancies and represents 25% of congenital lung malformations and 95% of congenital lung lesions .
it was classified into 3 subtypes in 1977 , and expanded into five types and renamed as congenital pulmonary airway malformation ( cpam ) by stocker in 2002 .
eighty percent of the lesions are recognized in neonatal period ; however , there are reports even in adult population . here , we have described two cases of ccam , stocker type ii and i , which were diagnosed by fetal autopsy .
serial ultrasonographic evaluation , fetal lung mass size , cvr , and fetal echocardiography are needed for management of antenatally detected cases .
ccam is a rare developmental , non - hereditary , hamartomatous abnormality of lung with unknown etiology .
a 30-year - old g2 p1 l1 , of nonconsanguineous marriage , had a normal antenatal course until 20.5 weeks of gestation , when she presented with history of per vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain since three days .
