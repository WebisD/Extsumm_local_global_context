crystallin proteins in the diabetic and age - related cataractous lenses were extracted and compared with those of normal subjects , using two - dimensional electrophoresis ( 2-de ) , maldi - tof - mass spectrometry ( ms ) , and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) analysis .
type i diabetic cataract lenses should contain the highest contents of beta - crystallin a3 , alpha - crystallin b chain , beta - crystallin b1 , and chain a of crystal structure of truncated human beta - b1-crystallin . compared with control subjects , age - related cataracts lenses revealed slightly higher concentrations of the four proteins above ; additionally , gi|194380530 , an unnamed crystalline - like protein was also detected in this group with significantly higher content .
in this study , proteins extracted from control , type i diabetic , and age - related cataracts lenses were applied to 2-de , ms , and elisa analysis .
the lens samples could only be extracted and studied through surgery after cataract was formed and detected ; therefore , to reveal the pathogenesis in the early stage of cataract , more attention could be devoted to gene research . to monitor the expression levels of the genes for these differential proteins
