average preoperative keratometry was not statistically significantly different between surgeons ( p = 0.41 ) ; means ranged from 43.8  d to 44.5  d. the magnitude of preoperative corneal cylinder was also not statistically significantly different between surgeons ( p = 0.13 ) ; means ranged from 0.79  d to 1.04  d. 
 table 1 contains a summary of the surgically induced astigmatism by surgeon
surgeons interested in reducing the magnitude and variability of induced astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery may want to consider the use of a 2.2  mm square posterior limbal incision .
the data reported here summarize the astigmatic changes produced with a small ( 2.2  mm ) square posterior limbal incision .
as a post hoc test , the ernest data were compared to the surgeon with the lowest average sia from the clear corneal incision group ( surgeon 5 ) ; there was a statistically significantly lower mean sia in the ernest cohort ( p = 0.001 ) .
the results suggest that the magnitude and the variability of surgically induced astigmatism with small incision surgery ( 2.2  mm ) is significantly lower if a posterior limbal incision is used instead of a clear corneal incision .
