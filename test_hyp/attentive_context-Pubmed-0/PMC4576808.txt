this study highlights anti - virulence propriety of c. gilletii , which could contribute to explain its efficacy in the traditional treatment of infectious diseases caused by p. aeruginosa .
finally , we must point out that c. gilletii , although belonging to the family of boraginaceae , one of the most important botanical families of plants producing pyrrolizidine alkaloids ( pas ) , does not harbor these alkaloids in investigated root barks and leaves samples ( detection limit , 2 g of pas per gram of plant material ) , excluding thus toxicological risk due to pas and ensuring a probable safe use of this plant .
all experiments were performed in six replicates in the case of the decrease of pyocyanin and elastase production was due to the interference of c. gilletii extracts with qs mechanisms , we assessed the impact of c. gilletii extracts on qs - regulated genes lasb and rhla genes ( coding for lasb elastase and rhamnolipid , respectively ) expression . therefore , the effect of c. gilletii extracts on lasb and rhla genes expression was monitored by using two pao1 reporter strains harboring qs - related ( lasb and rhla ) promoter - lacz fusions .
