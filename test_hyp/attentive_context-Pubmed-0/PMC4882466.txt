using the presidential youth fitness program s fitnessgram body composition data , results indicate that in each of the two most populous states , childhood obesity for each cohort of fifth graders over the 3-year timeframe will cost between $ 1.4 and $ 3.0 billion ( compared to normal - weight children who become overweight as adults ) and $ 1.8 and $ 3.0 billion ( compared to normal - weight children who remain at normal weight as adults ) beyond the direct medical expenses for children of normal weight who remain at normal weight throughout adulthood .
the resulting values represent the low , high , and recommended statewide lifetime costs of obesity for the ten - year - old cohorts accounting for adulthood weight gain ( see table 2 ) and compared to children who maintain normal weight as adults ( see table 3 ) .
hr for bmi , and in texas , between 36.5 and 36.8 percent of students were categorized as ni 
then , using the low , high , and recommended cost estimates suggested by finkelstein and colleagues ( 7 ) , the lifetime direct medical costs attributable to obesity were calculated for students in the ni  hr category for each of the three school years in california and in texas by multiplying the number of students in this category by the corresponding cost estimate per obese student
