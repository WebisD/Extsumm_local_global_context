in the year 2003 immunosuppressive therapy using mitoxantrone has been approved for treatment of patients with worsening relapsing - remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( ms ) in germany .
we report about serial cardiac evaluation in 30 consecutive patients before , during , and after mitoxantrone treatment in consecutive patients with ms . in the years 2006 and 2008 ,
from january 2003 to july 2004 , thirty consecutive patients with secondary progressive or worsening relapsing multiple sclerosis were treated with mitoxantrone at 3-month intervals .
however , systematic data on the course and incidence of cardiac toxicity following low - dose mitoxantrone are lacking . in the following ,
parameters of   impaired relaxation and respective abnormalities in diastolic filling of the heart may precede reductions in systolic pump function and respective ejection fraction , in patients receiving chemotherapy . on the basis of the current paper , we suggest to inform the patient about the potential insidious nature of cardiac toxicity and to monitor cardiac function in every patient prior and , systematically , during mitoxantrone therapy .
based on   numerous reports of early and late onset cardiotoxicity in individuals with low - dose mitoxantrone and our observations of dose - dependent effects on the heart , serial determination of cardiac function in each patient seems indicated .
