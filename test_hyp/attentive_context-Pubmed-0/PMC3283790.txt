most of the remaining ivc filters are asymptomatic and do not cause clinical problems . however , in order to prevent potential sequelae caused by ivc filter leg penetration , like that reported in this case , the removal of the ivc filter , when possible , is preferred .
a 33-year - old female patient presented at the emergency room with epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting that had persisted for a day .
the ivc filter is known as an effective and safe method for preventing fatal pulmonary thromboembolism in patients with deep vein thrombosis .
the patient had a history of child birth eight months prior , and had proximal deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) on the left common femoral vein during the 36th week of pregnancy .
thus , a partial resection of the ivc filter leg that was penetrating the duodenum was performed , and the ivc was reinforced .
the ivc filter is indicated in dvt patients when any of the following symptoms are present : contraindication of anticoagulation , major bleeding , need for surgery within 2 weeks , severe and prolonged thrombocytopenia , and recurrent dvt disease despite anticoagulation .
