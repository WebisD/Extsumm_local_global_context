, we report our initial 100 cases observations of spa - lavh ( with or without bilateral salpingooophrectomy ( bso ) ) using a homemade , single - port , three - channel system .
a linear correlation existed between the operation time and an extirpated uterine weight of > 400  g , because more time was needed for uterine fragmentation for extirpation through the vagina ; however , no linear correlation existed between the operation time and a uterus weight of < 400  g. for pelvic adhesion , such as in previous pelvic surgery or endometriosis , additional operation time is required for adhesiolysis .
the mean  sd of total operative time , largest dimension of the uterus , and weight of the uterus were 73.1  24.6  min , 10.5    2.1  cm , and 300.8  192.5  gram , respectively .
this is because the vaginal stump can be repaired not by laparoscopy , but through the vagina . in this study
particularly , single - port surgery is ideal for laparoscopic - assisted vaginal hysterectomy ( lavh ) because the vagina of woman can be considered as an additional route for surgery ; thus , uterine manipulators can be applied through the vagina   . unlike uterine repair following myomectomy or bowel reanastomosis after bowel resection
