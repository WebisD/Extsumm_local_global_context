the aim of this work was to evaluate the use of zimomonas mobilis levans insolubilized and ferromagnetized ( fmzag-12l ) , to purify fructose / specific lectins using lectin preparations of c. mollis seeds .
such inter- and multidisciplinarity corroborates the importance to develop new methodologies for the study of lectin - saccharide interactions and the potential applications in clinical diagnostics . in the present work a composite of the carbohydrate levan and magnetite
cramoll 1 was purified by this fast two - step procedure ( ammonium sulfate fractionation and fmzag-12l affinity binding ) instead of the laborious and time consuming three - step protocol previously described .
lectins complexed specifically to the composite were separated from other contaminant proteins by washing with a high ionic strength solution and obtained from composite with specific monosaccharide .
furthermore , the ferromagnetic composite of levan is synthesized by a simple and inexpensive method .
finally , it is important to investigate if other polysaccharides could replace the levan in the composite synthesis and be used to lectin purification .
cramoll 1 showed a higher intensity of staining to transformed tissues than normal ones : also , encapsulation of cramoll 1 into liposomes produced an improvement in its in vivo antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 compared with free cramoll 1 solution .
