given the high prevalence of obesity and its role in causing , exacerbating , or complicating many other chronic diseases , there appears to be an important need for educational programs focused on improving resident and physician knowledge about obesity and comorbidities .
survey responses indicate that obesity training increases physician knowledge of obesity treatment and may improve treatment rates and diversify treatment options for patients with obesity .
physicians should be knowledgeable about the impact of obesity in their patient population and be adequately prepared to assess obesity and administer care to patients with obesity in inpatient and outpatient settings .
, we sought to determine whether obesity training correlated with knowledge , beliefs , and attitudes about the etiology of and treatment of patients with obesity .
physicians with some obesity training were most likely to consider the following to be major barriers to evaluating and/or managing patients with overweight and obesity in their practice : ( 1 ) not having enough time , ( 2 ) not being part of my professional role , ( 3 ) inadequate training , ( 4 ) fear of offending the patient , ( 5 ) too difficult for patients to change , ( 6 ) lack of effective tools and information to give to patients , and ( 7 ) long wait times for referrals to obesity medicine specialists ( supplemental figure 1 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/841249 ) .
