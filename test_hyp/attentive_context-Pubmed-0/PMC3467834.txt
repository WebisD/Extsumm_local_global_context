the drug release was found to be better in solid dispersions prepared with pvp k-30 as compared to those prepared with hpmc .
increasing the drug carrier ratio from 1:1 to 1:4 improved drug release profiles observed in for all formulations in case of kneading method with pvp k-30 and hpmc but the drug release rate was higher in 1:4 ratio for both the polymers .
a mixture of drug and polymers in three different mass ratios were wetted with water and kneaded thoroughly for 30 minutes in a glass mortar .
physical mixtures of benfotiamin at three different mass ratios ( 1:1 , 1:2 , 1:3 and 1:4 ) were prepared .
the phase solubility studies were performed to determine stoichimetric proportions of benfotiamin and carriers- pvp k-30 and hpmc .
results of concentration of carriers on solubility of benfotiamin the plot of drug solubility against polymer concentrations at room temperature indicated a linear relationship between drug and polymer solution .
the dissolution study of pure drug , physical mixture and solid dispersion was carried out by using usp dissolution apparatus ( type 2 ) at 100 rpm at temperature of 37  0.5c using 900 ml volume of ml p. 1.2 and p. 7.4
