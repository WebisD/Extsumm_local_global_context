in this in vitro diagnostic study , we compared the tissue density values on cbct and ct images in four different tissue phantoms with two different thicknesses , two different acquisition settings and in three locations in the phantoms .
the correlation between the gray values obtained from cbct and the hus in ct images was evaluated and the effect of the type of tissue , tissue thickness , acquisition parameters and location was assessed in this regard .
comparison of voxel values in cbct systems with hounsfield units in ct in full thickness phantoms ns : non - significant s : significant comparison of voxel values in cbct systems with hounsfield units in ct in half thickness phantoms ns : non - significant s : significant
according to the results , the cbct systems were not able to show the accurate value of tissue density and the factors such as type of tissue ( hard , soft , water , air ) , thickness ( full against half ) , image acquisition conditions ( high settings against low settings ) and object location ( middle , peripheral and intermediate ) did not affect density evaluation by cbct systems .
