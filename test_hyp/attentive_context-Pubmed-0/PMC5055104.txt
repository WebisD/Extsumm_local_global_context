several biomarkers of eosinophilic copd exacerbations have been developed.3,911 of these , the peripheral blood eosinophil percentage is a simple and sensitive biomarker of sputum production and bronchial eosinophilia.3,12 a cutoff of 2% peripheral blood eosinophilia accurately identifies a sputum eosinophilia of > 3% upon exacerbation.3 in the present study , we classified copd patients into eosinophilic and neutrophilic exacerbation ( at the time of hospital admission ) groups , using data from complete blood cell counts .
as expected , the bacterial cluster was the largest , but the eosinophilia - predominant cluster constituted 28% of all exacerbations.3 inhaled or systemic steroids are used to minimize the symptoms of eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients with severe copd exacerbations.4 however , treatment failure is more common in noneosinophilic ( compared to eosinophilic ) copd patients receiving systemic steroids.5 ultimately , eosinopenia is associated with acute infection and inflammation ; these conditions , combined with leukocytosis , are predictive of further bacterial infection.6 eosinopenia is known to be an independent predictor of in - hospital mortality in patients with copd exacerbations.7,8 treatment outcomes differ by the cause of exacerbation . thus , phenotyping of copd exacerbations is clinically important .
the crp level was higher in the neutrophilic group . on the pft , fev1 and forced vital capacity were higher in the eosinophilic group ( p<0.001 and p=0.009 , respectively ) , but the severity of airway obstruction ( based on the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria ) did not differ between the two groups .
