we hereby report a case of 41-year - old male patient who acquired pws about a year ago .
the case report demonstrates a rare occurrence of a vascular malformation in an adult patient .
port - wine stains ( pwss ) are congenital vascular malformations comprised of ectatic dermal capillaries and affecting 0.3 - 1% of newborn infants .
acquired pwss are an uncommon entity developing later in life , but morphologically and histologically similar to the congenital lesions .
a 41-year - old male presented to the outpatient department of dermatology of our tertiary care hospital with complaint of asymptomatic reddish patches involving the lower part of right leg for 10 months .
this is the first report of an acquired port - wine stain from india and previous reports of such cases have also been reviewed .
an unusual finding in our patient was the presence of a lobular arrangement of dilated vessels in the dermis which has not been observed in previous cases of congenital or acquired pws .
pwss are congenital vascular malformations usually presenting at birth in the form of pink - red to purple macules , which become darker , raised , and nodular as the person ages .
