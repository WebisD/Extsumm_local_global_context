the aim of this study was to elucidate possible intervening effects of n-3 marine pufa ( dha and epa ) compared to the n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid ( ara , 20:4n-6 ) on mehg cytotoxicity in atlantic salmon kidney ( ask ) cells .
, the effects shown by dha and epa on mehg - induced toxicity , in this study , may help explain the differing toxicity observed in response to type of dietary mehg source .
human embryonic kidney ( hek293 ) cells were included in certain aspects of the study , and mehg - induced toxicity was compared between the two cell types by assessing effects on cell proliferation and death using the xcelligence system .
to our knowledge , this is the first time that ameliorating effects of the marine fatty acid epa on mehg - induced apoptosis are reported . taken together
in this study , the mediating effects of the marine n-3 fatty acids dha and epa on mehg toxicity were studied .
additionally , we investigated the regulation of transcriptional markers for mehg toxicity and fatty acids metabolism and how dha , epa , and mehg affected these in ask cells .
