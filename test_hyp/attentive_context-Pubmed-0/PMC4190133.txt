therefore , the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of iron - oxide nanoparticles over biofilm formation on different biomaterial and polymer brush coated surfaces .
a significant reduction in biofilm growth was observed due to the influence of iron - oxide nanoparticles on biofilms formed on polymer brush coated biomaterial surfaces .
iron - oxide nanoparticles are a special class of metal oxide nanoparticles with unique magnetic properties and superior biocompatibility .
significant reduction ( p < 0.05 ) in biofilm growth on all the three bacteria was observed in the presence of iron - oxide nanoparticles compared to control ( absence of iron - oxide nanoparticles ) .
this study demonstrates that wettability of a biomaterial surface influences bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth . polymer brush coated surfaces showed reduced bacterial adhesion compared to bare surfaces .
mg / ml of iron - oxide nanoparticles , the highest inhibition ( 29  mm ) was observed in s. aureus compared to e. coli and p. aeruginosa .
this trend holds good for all the three bacteria ( staphylococcus aureus , escherichia coli , and pseudomonas aeruginosa ) on both pmma and tcps surfaces .
