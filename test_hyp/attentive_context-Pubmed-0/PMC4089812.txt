we found very rare fgfr1 amplifications in non - squamous lung cancer : only one single case each of undifferentiated large cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma , but not in adenocarcinomas of the lung .
these data indicate that squamous cell carcinomas , adenosquamous , and undifferentiated large cell carcinomas should be included in fgfr1 amplification screening of lung cancer , but cases of pure adenocarcinoma may be omitted .
we and others recently described therapeutically targetable fgfr1 amplifications in smoking - associated human squamous lung cancers . this is a clinically important finding since worldwide this cohort of patients is steadily increasing in size and current therapies are very limited
therefore , we developed the following reading and evaluation strategy that was derived from our observations in lung cancer and fgfr1 data published previously from studies with other tumor entities : 
 assessment of hybridization quality : evaluate only samples and areas with sharp borders of nuclei , no signs of overdigestion , non - overlapping nuclei , bright and specific green and orange signals in internal control tissue and in the tumor area.scanning the slide : scan the entire tumor area for hot spots of increased fgfr1 copy numbers.reading the slide : count 20 tumor cell nuclei in three areas , either in three hot spots or in three random areas in case of homogeneous signal distribution .
