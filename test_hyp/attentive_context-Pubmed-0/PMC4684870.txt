leptin levels also tended to increase in asthmatics compared to nonasthmatics whether they were obese or nonobese . in view of the positive association between leptin and lt level , we examined cys - lt levels in the exhaled breath condensate ( ebc ) and peripheral blood leukocytes of asthmatics compared to nonasthmatics and obese compared to nonobese subjects .
adipokines , especially in obese female asthmatics , may promote an asthma phenotype that has become more prevalent and results in difficult to control airway disease .
proinflammatory mediators , cys - lt , were increased in obese asthmatics compared to nonobese nonasthmatics .
the asthma control test ( act ) questionnaire was lower in obese asthma ( 19.8  11.9 ) compared to nonobese asthma ( 22.1  1.6 ) patients , p = 0.01 .
( 5 ) pbm cys - lt levels were higher in women than in men , irrespective of asthma or obesity .
obese nonasthmatics also had lower adiponectin than nonobese nonasthmatics ( p = 0.017 ) . since both leptin and adiponectin are increased in women compared to men , we next examined the leptin / adiponectin ratio as a method to better compare genders with regard to the role of adipokines in the pathogenesis of asthma in obesity .
