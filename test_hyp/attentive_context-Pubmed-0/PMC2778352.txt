the aims and objectives of this study were ( a ) to study the clinical symptoms and signs of vitamin d deficiency and their correlation with 25-hydroxyvitamin d [ 25(oh ) d ] levels , ( b ) to study the bone profile of patients of hypovitaminosis d , and ( c ) to observe the response to treatment with vitamin d on these individuals .
there is a new and emerging body of literature showing relationship between vitamin d deficiencies and respiratory infections , along with obstetrical conditions such as pre - eclampsia .
taking the normal range of vitamin d , 25(oh ) d in our laboratory as 9.941.5 ng / ml , we classified our patients into 3 grades of vitamin d deficiency .
the bone profile of patients with vitamin d deficiency is shown in table 4 .  
vitamin d deficiency in this population , while symptomatic , was without any of florid signs ( 63% showed no tenderness  as shown in table 3 ) .
this is exemplified by the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in house bound and elderly patients   .
three conclusions can be drawn from this study : ( a ) vitamin d deficiency runs across the board ; importantly it affects individuals in the prime of their life and affects the quality of life and the productivity of those suffering from it ; ( b ) the preponderance of female patients compared to male patients suffering from vitamin d deficiencies possibly reflects social factors like the avoidance of milk and milk products and staying indoors ; ( c ) a large chunk of vitamin d deficiency is  subclinical .
