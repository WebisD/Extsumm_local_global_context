this longitudinal study examined full - time resident physicians at all training levels who were enrolled in an accreditation council for graduate medical education , accredited training program in internal medicine ( n = 204 ) , pediatrics ( n = 153 ) , or emergency medicine ( n = 40 ) , from july 2010 to june 2013 , at tertiary care university hospitals in two health systems . residents were recruited during an hour - long educational conference in which they received an explanatory letter about the study and asked to participate . to maximize participation and account for differences in academic schedules ,
the proportion of participants who had diagnosed ( p = 0.06 ) or managed ( p = 0.06 ) anaphylaxis or used an epinephrine autoinjector ( p = 0.08 ) in the past did not differ significantly from baseline to follow - up . of the participants who reported having managed anaphylaxis prior to the study , the most common venue was the emergency department ( 42.35% ) , followed by general ward ( 20.59% ) , intensive care unit ( 24.71% ) , and then allergy office ( 2.35% ) ( data not shown ) . also , the proportion of participants who self - reported being confident in their ability to diagnose ( p < 0.001 ) or manage ( p < 0.001 ) anaphylaxis increased from baseline to follow - up .   table 3 summarizes participants ' self - reported behaviors and attitudes at follow - up . during the interval since the intervention , despite increased self - reported confidence in adam , residents appear to have had few opportunities to utilize what they have learned about anaphylaxis , or to refer patients with anaphylaxis to allergists .
