remote magnetic non - irrigated catheters do not appear to be inferior to magnetic irrigated catheters in terms of myocardial marker release and clinical outcome .
our study demonstrates a significant positive correlation between myocardial marker levels and total ablation time with both manual and mn catheters . a considerably lower time - corrected tnt level ( tntc ) was associated with the mn system , whether irrigated or non - irrigated catheters were employed .
cir conventional manual irrigated catheter , rmi remote magnetic irrigated catheter , rmn remote magnetic non - irrigated catheter further analysis revealed a significant correlation between the total ablation time and post - ablation serum concentration of tnt ( cir r  =  0.61 , p  <  0.01 ; rmi r  =  0.74 , p  <  0.001 ; and rmn r  =  0.51 , p  <  0.01 , respectively ; fig .  2 ) .
if the troponin level was corrected for ablation time ( tntc ) , the mean tntc ( g / l per 1000 seconds ablation ) was considerably higher in the cir group than in either the rmn or rmi groups ( 0.61 vs. 0.30 and 0.23  g / l , p  <  0.001 ) .
