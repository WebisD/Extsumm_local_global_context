also , in order to make vls experiments easier to perform to a broad community of users , we have interfaced several additional utilities ( such as binding site prediction , openbabel  ) and processed five major compound collections .
a rational approach to increase the efficiency of finding new drugs and reduce the r&d cost is to reduce the attrition rate in the costly downstream stages ( e.g. clinical trials ) .
we have developed faf - drugs to help modelers and biologists to embark into drug discovery projects .
users can filter their own compound libraries and adapt the thresholds to a specific project .
drug discovery is a complex and expensive endeavor that usually requires seven major steps : disease selection , target hypothesis , lead compound identification ( screening ) , lead optimization , pre - clinical trial , clinical trial and pharmacogenomic optimization . among the various techniques used to facilitate the drug discovery process , virtual or in silico ligand screening ( vls ) based on the structure of known ligands or on the structure of the receptor is becoming a method of choice ( 111 ) , as seen in several recent studies [ reviewed in ( 1216 ) ] .
