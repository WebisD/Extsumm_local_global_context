neurofibromatosis type-1 ( nf-1 ) is a multisystem , autosomal dominant disorder of peripheral nerves affecting nearly 1/3000 individuals worldwide.1 it was first described by a german pathologist , friedrich daniel von recklinghausen .
common skeletal manifestations of nf-1 include spinal deformities , congenital tibial dysplasia ( congenital bowing and pseudarthrosis ) , sphenoidal dysplasia and cystic lesions in bones . pathological fracture of the acetabulum with anterior dislocation of hip secondary to osseous involvement of the acetabulum , femoral head , and pubic rami has never been documented in a case of nf-1 .
although involvement of the musculoskeletal system is common , there have been only a few cases of subluxation / dislocation of hip in patients with nf [ table 3].34567891011121314 on reviewing the literature , the etiology of hip instability leading to pathological subluxation / dislocation in patients with nf-1 can be classified as local and remote .
a 16-year - old boy presented with the complaints of pain in the left hip associated with the inability to bear weight following a trivial fall . on examination , the affected limb was 1.5 cm short , abducted and externally rotated .
inherited or spontaneous mutation of the neurofibromin gene located on chromosome 17 is responsible for this diverse disorder .
