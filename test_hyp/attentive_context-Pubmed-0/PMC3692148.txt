we report an elderly lady with a combination of risk factors who developed rhabdomyolytic acute renal failure .
rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle necrosis and the release of intracellular muscle contents into the systemic circulation .
the spectrum of the syndrome ranges from asymptomatic serum muscle enzymes elevation to life - threatening extreme enzyme elevations , electrolyte imbalances , and acute renal failure .
a 65-year - old lady was suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past 30 years , hypertension for the past 20 years , and coronary heart disease for the past 10 years .
however , it is difficult to directly compare the incidence of statin myopathy in clinical trials with real world clinical practice given the inconsistent definitions .
the present patient provided a caution that hypothyroidism and interaction with other drugs should be considered when patients were going to be initiated on statins .
frusemide was stopped as she had hypokalemia before the onset of illness which was again a risk factor for rhabdomyolysis .
the following three risk factors for the onset of rhabdomyolysis were identified : use of statin , undiagnosed hypothyroidism , and co - administration of amlodipine and clopidogrel .
