this research methodology was thus an effective way to reach the community , have them reflect on the changes in tobacco use and promote awareness of the need for environmental change , while simultaneously engendering development of youth research skills and abilities ( 8) .
perhaps more importantly , the research proved valuable in providing the community with a lens through which to view how youth see smoking in their environment .
unfortunately , the traditional use of tobacco for spiritual purposes has been radically changed to the modern addiction to tobacco , which has caused negative health issues for many youth and community members ( 43 ) .
the youth researchers learned research skills , while the research team partners learned valuable lessons on structuring research and dissemination products that were more appropriate , effective and powerful for the student participants and community . shared decision - making was an integral part of the research , ranging from initial decisions on the research concept and design to the final decisions on dissemination .
based on this research , youth assuming a partnership role in research activities presents fruitful ground for continued advances in making positive health changes in northern aboriginal communities .
