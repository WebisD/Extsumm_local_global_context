the current study was designed to determine if feeding the high fiber probiotic fermented mare 's milk could alleviate the toxic effects of mercury in rat model .
we conclude that high fiber fermented mare 's milk containing probiotic had a protective effect against brain and kidney alterations produced by mercury toxicity .
we have combined these three health - promoting materials to produce a functional food composed of fermented mare 's milk plus a high level ( 6% ) of soluble fiber and probiotics .
cellular and tissue changes were noticed in the positive control , including generalized and localized edema in the white mater of cerebrum and cerebellum .
although the composition of all 3 was similar , the antioxidant capacity was highest in the high fiber probiotic fermented mare 's milk compared to fresh or fermented mare 's milk . chemical compositions and antioxidant capacity of fresh , fermented , and high fiber fermented mare 's milk as shown in table 2 , the untreated ( negative control ) rats gained weight during this experiment , while there was a large decrease in the weight of the rats in the positive control group .
body weight changes following different treatments treatment with mercuric chloride ( positive control)resulted in an increase in the rat 's kidney weight compared to the untreated negative control rats ( table 3 ) .
