the weight examinations showed slight decreases in the weights of four female rats ( two female rats in the 1,000 mg / kg group and two female rats in the 2,000 mg / kg group ) .
the results of this reseach showed that administration of 500  2,000 mg / kg of super key did not cause any changes in the weights of sd rats or in the results of necropsy examinations . neither did it result in any mortalities , which indicates that the lethal dose of super key is higher than 2,000 mg / kg .
the current research trend for oral toxicity testing of extracts is to study acute and subacute toxicity through good laboratory practice ( glp ) regulations .
the mean weights of the rats were 285.3  314.5 g and 200.5  222.9 g , respectively , for the male and the female rats at the time of super key administration .
this study was performed to examine the oral toxicity and the lethal dose of super key .
the testing methods were visual observation of the general symptoms , body weight changes and necropsy findings in 8-weeks - old sprague - dawley ( sd ) rats .
