corneal collagen cross - linking ( cxl ) with riboflavin and ultraviolet - a ( uv - a ) is currently the only treatment that can halt or delay the progression of keratoconus . in this technique
, the combined action of riboflavin and uv - a rays is utilized to increase the corneal strength and integrity by polymerization of the stromal fibers.12 with the widespread adoption of this technique , reports of side - effects and complications are increasing.34567 in this case report , we present two patients who developed clinically diagnosed herpetic keratitis in the early postoperative period after cxl .
prophylactic systemic antiviral treatment in patients with a history of the herpetic disease after cxl with uv - a might decrease the possibility of recurrence .
supports a herpes virus as the cause of keratitis in these cases but does not exclude the possibility of herpes zoster keratitis . in conclusion , cxl with riboflavin and uv - a can induce herpes keratitis with or without iritis .
, we recommend laboratory analysis to support the clinical diagnosis of hsv keratitis and rule out similar herpes zoster virus keratitis . the prompt response to antiviral therapy
none of these factors were significantly associated with recurrence of herpetic keratitis . in this case report , we describe two patients who developed typical dendritic herpetic epithelial keratitis after cxl treatment . in our cases , the presumed clinical diagnosis of herpetic keratitis was supported by the clinical appearance of the lesions , delayed epithelial healing , decreased corneal sensation and the rapid response to antiviral treatment . in our cases , we typically follow the patient carefully until the epithelium is intact ; delayed healing raises the suspicion of secondary infective keratitis .
