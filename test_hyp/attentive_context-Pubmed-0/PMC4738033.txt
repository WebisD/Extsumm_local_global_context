trataka showed better performance on the stroop color  word test compared to the control session , suggesting increased selective attention , cognitive flexibility , and response inhibition following trataka .
hence , the present study was designed to assess the immediate effect of trataka on cognitive performance using the stroop color  word test .
post hoc analyses with bonferroni adjustment was performed and all comparisons were made using the respective  pre  states . there was a significant difference between the  post  session of trataka and of the control ( p  <  0.001 ) .
in this study , stroop color  word test was assessed before and after the practice of trataka and control sessions in 30 male volunteers .
the stroop color  word test is an index of executive functioning such as interference control , selective attention and cognitive flexibility , and response inhibition.9 , 10 , 11 
 trataka showed better performance on the stroop color  word test compared to the control session .
each participant was assessed during two sessions ( a trataka and a control session ) on two separate days .
there was a significant increase in the word score ( p  <  0.001 ) , color score ( p  <  0.001 ) , and color  word score ( p  <  0.001 ) after trataka compared to before trataka . and also , there was a significant increase in the word score ( p  <  0.01 ) , color score ( p  <  0.001 ) , and color  word score ( p  <  0.001 ) after the control session compared to before .
