in addition , we analyzed the preoperative diagnostic characteristics of this lelcb by measuring its apparent diffusion coefficient ( adc ) value by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and compared this to those of past cases of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder at our institution .
it is necessary to consider a diagnosis of lelcb when turbt indicates an undifferentiated carcinoma .
we herein report a case of lelcb , with a preoperative diagnosis of an undifferentiated carcinoma , in which radical cystectomy and systemic chemotherapy were successfully undertaken .
additionally , measuring the adc value of a urinary bladder tumor may be helpful in predicting its pathological features .
we treated a rare case of lelcb , classed as a pure type and with a better prognosis than the focal type according to the classification of amin et al . .
a lymphoepithelioma - like carcinoma ( lelc ) is a tumor which mimics lymphoepithelioma in terms of its pathological features .
pure ( 100% ) , predominant ( 5099% ) and focal ( < 50% )  , with the three types determining a patient 's prognosis .
on cystoscopy , two bladder tumors were observed , one on the left side of the trigone and the other on the right side of the trigone .
