in this study , quantitative 
 peptidomics was employed to study the 
 neuropeptide changes in the jonah crab cancer borealis associated with acute temperature elevation .
the results showed 
 that neuroendocrine organs , including the pericardial organ and the 
 sinus gland , were actively involved with the temperature perturbation 
 response .
the neuropeptides released by these two organs may be involved 
 with temperature change response via hormonal regulation .
a number of neuropeptides were found to be decreased in two neuroendocrine 
 organs , po and sg , indicating that these two organs were actively 
 involved in the temperature perturbation response . in addition , the 
 neuropeptidome changes of the brain and circulating fluid hemolymph 
 were also examined .
have already been identified in previous studies using mass spectrometry , 
 facilitating us to further assess their functions . in this study , we measured 
 the neuropeptide changes in three different 
 neural organs in the nervous system of c. borealis in response to acute temperature elevation using dimethyl labeling . 

this study 
 provided direct evidence that neuropeptides may play an important 
 role in the regulation of biological changes in crustaceans in response 
 to environmental perturbation .
, we employed a mass spectrometry - based 
 strategy to examine the quantitative changes of neuropeptides caused 
 by temperature elevation .
