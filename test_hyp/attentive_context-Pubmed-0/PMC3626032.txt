in this study , we demonstrate an altered pattern of gene expression for cytokine and chemokine encoding genes in the gastric tissue of individuals with obesity and varying degrees of hepatic inflammation and different forms of nafld .
, we performed comparative expression profiling for 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , their receptors and other components of inflammatory cascades in samples of gastric tissue removed during sleeve gastrectomy .
although the causal links between these signaling events remains to be determined , we propose that the fundus of the stomach is an integral player in the signaling milieu associated with both obesity - related nafld .
the expression levels of anti - inflammatory receptor il1rn , an antagonist of il1a and il1b , were positively correlated both with the presence of nash and with fibrosis ( table 3 ) . in the regression model predicting fibrosis , expression of il1rn mrna was the only significant component that explained 34% of the variance in fibrosis .
observations listed above prompted us to hypothesize that the gastric tissue in obese subjects is actively contributing to the systemic inflammation and pathogenesis of one of the complications of obesity , nafld . to investigate this
