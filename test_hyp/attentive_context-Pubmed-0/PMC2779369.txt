the guidelines specify the criteria for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and the assessment of its severity that have been prepared by the research group and are in widespread use in japan . because the guidelines address so many different topics , an index of all works used is included at the end of the series of articles for the convenience of readers .
the guidelines are evidence - based and determined with a grade for each medical practice , taking actual conditions into account .
several sets of evidence - based guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis have been published ; those of the atlanta symposium of 1992,1 the united kingdom guidelines of 1998,2 and the santorini consensus conference of 19993 are representative . however , they were based on the evidence available at the time , and the validity of any set of guidelines is shortlived and guidelines need to be revised every 2 years.1 indeed , new evidence is reported almost daily , and guidelines for management in clinical settings are changing nearly as fast , thanks to the remarkable advances in medical equipment and treatment techniques developed in recent years .
