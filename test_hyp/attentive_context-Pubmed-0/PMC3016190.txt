herein , we analyze the existing literature on lvhr , in an effort to examine the optimal surgical technique , complications , and long - term results in comparison with the open ventral hernia repair ( ovhr ) .
the technique offers the advantages of the laparoscopic approach , ie , a short hospital stay , less postoperative pain , and early convalescence .
our review indicates that lvhr is a safe and effective approach to abdominal wall hernias .
the procedure carries an acceptable risk of complications , a low risk of recurrence , and an excellent cosmetic result .
an increasing interest in laparoscopic surgery and the availability of new materials have encouraged the adoption of laparoscopic techniques in ventral hernia repair .
incisional hernia is a common long - term complication of abdominal surgery and is estimated to occur in 3% to 13% of laparotomy incisions .
however , larger , long - term multicenter studies comparing the laparoscopic with the open technique are needed to establish its efficacy . for the time being , it is considered a good alternative to its open counterpart , at least in experienced hands .
nevertheless , open hernia repair can be a major operation with considerable morbidity due to mesh - related infections .
