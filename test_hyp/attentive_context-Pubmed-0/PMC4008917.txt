we report on a suspect adr to chlorpromazine that occurred in a 12-year - old boy , affected by severe generalized anxiety disorder .
this is the first report on a case of tinnitus related to the administration of chlorpromazine .
tinnitus is a common adverse reaction ( adr ) to several drugs and may occur during long - term therapies or after a single drug administration .
its effect is mediated via interactions with several receptors in the central nervous system and results from a combination of antidopaminergic , anticholinergic , antihistaminic , and weak antiadrenergic actions .
although there is no information on dechallenge and rechallenge , the inability to discontinue therapy with chlorpromazine resulted in an objective worsening of the patient 's symptoms .
to our knowledge , this is the first report on the development of tinnitus following chlorpromazine administration .
this clinical case is of great clinical interest as chlorpromazine is not currently included among potentially ototoxic drugs ; paradoxically phenothiazines can be prescribed to alleviate symptoms related to disorders of the vestibular system .
to date , over 130 drugs have been described to be potentially ototoxic , among which the most common inducers of tinnitus are aminoglycosides and other antimicrobials .
