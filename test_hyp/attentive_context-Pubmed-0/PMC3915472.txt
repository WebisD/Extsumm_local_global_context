about 65% of households were in the same quintiles , with a weighted kappa statistics of 0.76 . for households in different quintiles ,
the distribution of asset items ownership in each quintile of the community because of the similarity of the weights of indicators in the pca model which are all around.4 , we replaced these weights with 1 to compute the index as : kitchen + bathroom + washing machine + vacuum cleaner + freezer + pc . comparing this very simplified index with the 33-item wealth index
we propose that this simplification is able to improve potential for equity analysis and pro - equity policies , especially in developing countries .
the national statistical office ( nso ) of iran provides each year an estimate of the national demographic characteristics , annual income , annual consumption expenditure , ownership of assets and housing quality . the living standards measurement study ( lsms ) data
comparison of the agreement between the quintiles produced based on the 33-item proxy wealth index and the very simplified ( vs ) 6-item proxy wealth index the relationship between the simplified score and the quintile the household belongs to
