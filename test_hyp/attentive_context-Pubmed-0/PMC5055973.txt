the purpose of this paper was to conduct a literature review of selected disciplines that contribute to weight bias research in order to overview the common , potentially competing , and emerging perspectives on this topic .
the similarities among , and differences between , each of these perspectives were examined with regard to five research questions : ( a ) what is the language used to refer to weight and individuals with large bodies ? ( b ) through what general lens is discussion of weight bias approached ? ( c ) what theoretical positions are used to discuss the source or causes of weight bias ?
in addition to these perspectives , we also provide a brief overview of literature pertaining to the social determinants of health , as it supports our discussion of weight - based inequity identified among the three perspectives .
they propose that researchers , practitioners , and policy makers who critique obesity discourse need to work across artificial barriers .
clare and colleagues   proposed that such integration may be fostered through applied interdisciplinarity , which focuses on strategically utilizing the knowledge and skills of various areas regarded as stakeholders of a specific issue . in this discussion , we have invited researchers to recognize weight bias as an important social justice issue and to consider ways that our unique and combined efforts might address the aversive conditions under which body size is demarcated in our society as a space for the maltreatment and oppression of people .
