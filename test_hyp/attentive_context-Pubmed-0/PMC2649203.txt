the mean spearman correlation coefficients between the intakes of energy and energy - yielding nutrients between the two methods were moderate to high , i.e. 0.40.6 , while figures for most micro - nutrients were in the range 0.30.5 .
emphasis should be put on estimations of the type and amount of fat used in order to obtain a valid assessment of total fat and fat quality .
cross - classification ( quintiles ) and correlation of intakes of energy , energy - yielding nutrients and dietary fibre ( in absolute and energy - adjusted values ) , according to orfr and wr 
                         percent subjects in first quintile wr classified into first and second quintiles in orfr . 
                        
the above findings indicate that when a pre - coded food record is used this is designed for scanning , the following advantages ensue : it is less time - consuming for subjects to record their food intake because there is no need for weighing and writing.it allows more efficient data processing , e.g. by limiting time spent on data entry.a pre - coded and orfr is less expensive to process than a manual version is.emphasis should be put on estimations of the type and amount of fat used in order to obtain a valid assessment of total fat and fat quality.the portion sizes should be estimated carefully measured to reflect the actual portion sizes in the study population .
