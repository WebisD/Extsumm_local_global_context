described in this report is a case of a painful osteolytic vertebral metastasis that was successfully treated by a novel percutaneous vertebral augmentation system .
a 42-year - old caucasian female presented with a history of metastatic lung cancer unresponsive to radiation and chemotherapy with symptoms inadequately controlled by opiates over the previous 6 months . magnetic resonance imaging and spiral computed tomography with two - dimensional reconstruction showed an osteolytic vertebral metastasis with complete involvement of the t10 vertebral body , extending to the cortical vertebral wall anteriorly and posteriorly .
the patient was treated with percutaneous vertebral augmentation ( kiva vcf treatment system , benvenue medical , inc , santa clara , ca ) utilizing a novel coil - shaped polyetheretherketone implant designed to minimize the risk of cement extravasation .
percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are appealing adjunctive procedures in patients with malignancy for alleviation of intractable pain .
the kiva system represents a novel and effective minimally invasive treatment option for patients suffering from severe pain due to osteolytic vertebral metastasis .
after the minimally invasive procedure , bone cement distribution within the vertebral body was ideal , with no observed cement extravasation .
no complications were reported , pain completely resolved within 24 hours , and use of intravenous narcotics was progressively diminished within 1 week .
