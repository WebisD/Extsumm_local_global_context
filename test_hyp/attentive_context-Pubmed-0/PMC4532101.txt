we documented diastolic mitral regurgitation by color doppler echocardiography in a patient with acute aortic regurgitation .
diastolic mitral regurgitation has been described in patients with acute aortic regurgitation and those with atrioventricular block or atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular responses .
reversibility of diastolic mitral regurgitation after correction of hemodynamic loading , that was widely believed but not actually demonstrated , was also observed .
the mechanisms of diastolic mitral regurgitation in patients with acute aortic regurgitation have been considered to be the summation of the following pathophysiology : reversed atrio - ventricular pressure gradient due to aortic regurgitation in the non - compliant ventricle , increased mitral annulus due to ventricular relaxation and lack of papillary muscle tension . that of the patients with atrioventricular block or atrial fibrillation has been considered to be lack of atrial factors for mitral valve closure .
a 38-year - old japanese man with no previous cardiovascular disease was admitted to our hospital because of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and low grade fever of four weeks duration .
this case indicated the possibility of additional mechanisms of diastolic mitral regurgitation , namely , depression of the anterior mitral leaflet or retraction of the chordae connecting to the posterior mitral leaflet .
