according to existence or extent of coronary stenosis , individuals with significant stenosis had dramatically elevated levels of fpg , ppg , and hba1c and had a significantly increased prevalence of diabetes compared with both groups of participants with < 50% coronary stenosis and without stenosis after controlling for a variety of confounding factors ( all p < 0.05 ; fig .
general characteristics of study population by glycemic status as shown in table 1 , coronary plaques were found in 58 ( 43.0% ) participants with ngr , in 77 ( 58.3% ) with prediabetes , and in 74 ( 55.2% ) with diabetes ( p for trend = 0.081 ) , whereas plaques causing significant coronary stenosis were detected in 10 ( 7.4% ) , 10 ( 7.6% ) , and 22 ( 16.4% ) individuals with ngr , prediabetes , and diabetes , respectively ( p for trend = 0.029 ) .
women were strongly protected from significant coronary stenosis [ or , 0.33 ( 95% ci , 0.140.81 ) ; p = 0.016 ; table 2 ] .
percentages of diabetes and levels of glucose evaluations in participants 1 ) without coronary stenosis , 2 ) with < 50% coronary stenosis , and 3 ) with significant coronary stenosis , respectively .
