in particular , we were able to replicate existing knowledge on the pivotal role of hyperintense wm lesions for ms diagnosis by using this approach to the separate between pms patients and hc subjects . by using the classification approach for differential diagnosis or separation of pms subgroups respectively , we found diagnostic information specific for eopms in frontal gyri and also wm areas in the vicinity of frontal gyri .
, we searched for diagnostic information for separation of eopms patients vs. healthy control ( hc ) subjects separately for gm and wm areas . finally , in analysis 3 we tested local diagnostic separability of lopms vs. hc based on local gm and wm tissue probability parameters
these results suggest that conventional mri contains a richer set of diagnostically informative features than assumed so far . taken together , by integrating results from diagnostic classification analyses investigating groups matched for disease duration , lesion load , participant age , and gender , we identified biomarkers specific for ms patients with very early disease onset .
importantly , lopms and hc were matched with eopms with regard to gender , the lopms and eopms group were additionally matched in terms of disease duration and lesion load . in three supplementary analyses ,
