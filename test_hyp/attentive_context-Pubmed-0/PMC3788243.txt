this case report describes the successful anesthetic management of a patient with eb presenting for syndactyly release .
epidermolysis bullosa ( eb ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal fragility of skin and mucosal surface .
a 6-year - old male child , weighing 14 kg ; a known case of eb since birth presented with congenital left hand syndactyly [ figure 1 ] .
in addition to considerations associated with positioning , monitoring , infection , and prevention of skin and mucosal trauma , anesthetic management of eb is uniquely challenging because of the effects on the airway .
hence , meticulous execution of preoperative planning is indispensable for ensuring a favorable intraoperative and postoperative course .
patients with eb present a unique challenge for all anesthesia - care providers . with maximal skin and mucous membrane protection , anesthesia in children with eb can be conducted with few sequelae .
the separation of skin layers occurs after application of friction or shearing forces and results in intradermal fluid accumulation and bullae formation .
eb encompasses an array of autosomal dominant and recessive conditions that may have either localized or generalized dermatological manifestations .
neuromuscular blockade was antagonized at the end of the procedure , and trachea extubated when adequate signs of spontaneous recovery were evident .
