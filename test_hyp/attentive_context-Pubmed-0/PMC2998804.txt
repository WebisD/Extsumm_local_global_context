similarly , local injections of vb4 - 845 were well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with adverse events ( aes ) being mild and easily managed.19 in addition to the strong nonclinical safety profile , vb4 - 845 exhibits highly potent activity against epcam - expressing tumor cell lines and has been shown to localize to epcam - positive tumor xenografts.12 based on these preclinical results , a phase i dose - escalation trial was performed using vb4 - 845 as an intravesical therapy in bcg - refractory and bcg - intolerant patients with grade 2 or 3 nmibc .
preliminary efficacy results from this high - risk , often treatment - refractory , patient population suggest that vb4 - 845 can safely inhibit tumor growth in patients with epcam - positive , high - grade nmibc .
it consists of an anti - epcam humanized single - chain variable fragment ( scfv ) linked to a truncated form of pseudomonas exotoxin a ( eta252608 ) that lacks the cell - binding domain.12 once bound to epcam on the surface of carcinoma cells , vb4 - 845 is internalized , whereupon the exotoxin portion of the fusion protein induces apoptosis.13,14 one concern of targeted therapies has been the toxicity associated with systemic administration of this class of drug.15 moreover , repeated use of therapeutics comprising foreign proteins is limited by their immunogenicity . therefore , it is desirable to develop therapies designed for local administration , thereby increasing the clinical benefit of these treatments while minimizing any drug - related effects . accordingly , locoregional delivery of eta - conjugated antibodies has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and clinically effective in patients with glioblastoma multiforme , erbb2-expressing breast tumors , and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.1618 nonclinical studies showed a significant reduction in toxicity with locally administered vb4 - 845 .
