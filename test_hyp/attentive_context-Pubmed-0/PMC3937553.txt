the use of model compounds with diastereomeric rotamers 
 provides evidence that rotation about this bond in phenanthriplatin 
 is rapid , eliminating any need to isolate and administer an enantiomerically 
 pure compound .
the solid state structure of phenanthriplatin 
 highlights the fact 
 that asymmetry of the phenanthridine ligand about the 
 platinum coordination plane results in chirality .
rapid rotation about the this bond also prevents the 
 kinetic resolution of diastereomers in complexes of the type cis-[pt(nh3)2(phenanthridine)(9-alkylguanine ) ] , which mimic the interaction of phenanthriplatin 
 with dna .
the chirality of phenanthriplatin combined 
 with coordination to r - gua creates diastereomers , the nature of which 
 was investigated by x - ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy . here
the ( mp , pg ) and ( pp , mg ) diastereomers observed in both solution and the solid state are 
 those in which the h8 g and h6p are located on 
 the same side of the platinum coordination plane .
we report the results of an investigation of these diastereomeric 
 analogs of phenanthriplatin ( chart 2 ) , which 
 were prepared to investigate whether the two phenanthriplatin enantiomers 
 can be resolved on the physiological time scale .
the experimental 
 data described above indicate that interaction between the guanine 
 carbonyl and cis - coordinated ammine determines the 
 preferential diastereomer formation .
