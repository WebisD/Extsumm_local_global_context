surgical insertion of a ticvp system with percutaneous subclavian venous access is a safe procedure with a lower complication rate and many clinical benefits .
all of the procedures were performed with one small skin incision and subcutaneous puncture of a subclavian vein . in this article , we summarize our experience of the ticvp system and present the success and complication rate of this surgical method .
secondary insertion of the port system was performed in 6 patients , including 3 after it was surgically inserted with this method , 2 after radiology - guided insertion , and 1 inserted at another institution .
between march 2009 and december 2010 , 245 port systems were implanted into 242 patients by thoracic surgeons .
the purpose of this study is to determine whether implanting a ticvp system with surgical methods is as safe as performing it with radiologic guidance .
a series of 245 port systems were implanted into 242 patients , including 82 men and 160 women , with an age range of 14 to 86 years ( mean , 55.74 ) . in 240 of the patients ,
early complications within 30 days of surgery occurred in 11 patients ( 4.49% ) , including malposition of the catheter tip in 6 , malfunction of the catheter in 3 , and port site infection in 2 . among patients who experienced malposition of the catheter tip
