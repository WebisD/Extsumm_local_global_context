based on the abovementioned research data , no relationship between alcohol consumption and ad exists . in addition , although low - to - moderate consumption of alcohol may protect against ad , leading to benefits on neurodegeneration , a , oxidative stress and  neurofibrilary tangle formation suggest bias regarding the definition of low - to - moderate consumption as well as the variability of beverages containing alcohol . in addition , the absence of studies on the possible side effects of chronic exposure to alcohol on peripheral organs such as liver , and kidney lead to the necessity to delineate global and standard protocols for advanced studies .
however , the results should be considered as controversial and insufficient to suggest abstainers that initiate alcohol consumption in a preventive manner against ad .
similar features have been denoted between the effects of alcohol on cognition , brain disorder and brain biochemistry with the biological effects of ad , suggesting that the use of alcohol may constitute a risk for aggravating or developing ad ( 10 ) . in line with this view
heavy alcohol consumption impairs cognitive performance with immediate and long - term effects on the brain anatomy and neuropsychological functioning ( 1821 ) .
