the analysis of data of food and nutrient intake shows that 24-hour recall with the use of food photos yields results that are comparable to those obtained by fw . the 24-hour recall method in combination with food photos
the value of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.644 ( folate ) to 0.985 ( vitamin b1 ) . in order to assess the agreement between the methods for all nutrients , bland 
it is a better alternative for obtaining an accurate and representative estimation of the current or usual nutrient intake in large - scale dietary surveys in tunisia .
our study may be the first using photographs to assess nutrient intake in free - living conditions in tunisia .
further work to develop and test sets of food photographs for use in different areas and population groups in the mediterranean region and africa is needed .
3 , like carbohydrate intake , the difference in estimates of total protein ( g ) and fiber ( g ) intakes between the two methods became progressively greater with higher mean intakes .
our data analyses of individual food categories and nutrients intake show that the fp 24-hr was able to adequately estimate the weights of food portions and gave results that are comparable to the actually consumed amounts ( fw ) .
