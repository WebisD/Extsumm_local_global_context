we described for the first time a case of acs originating from an elongated sigmoid colon in an elderly man .
abdominal compartment syndrome ( acs ) is defined as a sustained intra - abdominal pressure ( iap ) associated with new organ dysfunction / failure .
considering the growing aging population and higher likelihood of acs , surgeons will need to precisely diagnose acs and determine the optimal time for surgery .
an 86-year - old man presented at our hospital for chronic constipation with elongated sigmoid colon .
we report the first known case of acs owing to simple elongated sigmoid colon , without volvulus or peritonitis .
this report may serve as a warning case for surgeons that acs may occur even in simple elongated colon without volvulus or peritonitis .
the disordered physiology following iah may result in a clinical syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality .
histological examination showed normal sigmoid ganglion cells , and the patient was diagnosed with simple elongated sigmoid colon without volvulus and idiopathic megacolon .
acs is defined as a sustained iap  >  20  mmhg that is associated with new organ dysfunction / failure .
acs was first reported by kron et al . in 1984 , who described its pathophysiology resulting from iah secondary to aortic aneurysm surgery .
