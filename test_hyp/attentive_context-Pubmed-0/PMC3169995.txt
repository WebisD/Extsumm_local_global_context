intogen is a cancer analysis tool designed to facilitate the integration , analysis , exploration and interpretation of oncogenomic data . in addition to its browser , its biomart interface provides access to high - throughput data related to genomic and transcriptomic alterations taking place in different types of cancers .
we continuously work on improvements and updates on the system to be able to incorporate the data obtained using sequencing technologies . with more high - quality data and new analysis methods incorporated into intogen ,
hence , it is clear the need for approaches to analyze and integrate cancer genomics data .
each study contains results from high - throughput analyses of a number of human primary tumor samples compared to normal cells ( normal cells of the same tissue in the case of expression ) related to one or more types of cancer for a specific alteration . at the first step
another advantage of using intogen is that the data downloaded can directly be analyzed in gitools ( 11 ) ( http://www.gitools.org ) , which is a stand - alone tool designed for the analysis and visualization of high - throughput data .
for example , one can easily perform enrichment analyses on intogen data with modules or gene sets from various biomart portals to explore large - scale patterns in cancer genomics data ( see http://help.gitools.org/xwiki/bin/view/tutorials/ for examples ) . with cheaper and faster sequencing technologies being available continuously ,
