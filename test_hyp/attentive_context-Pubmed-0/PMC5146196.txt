considering the  insulin resistance or altered plasma glucose  as important pathogenic link for depression associated with obesity , the present study was designed to investigate the effect of pioglitazone on cums induced depression in obese mice using behavioral tests and biochemical estimations .
the plasma glucose level indicates that the  altered plasma glucose or insulin resistance  , to play a crucial role in such co - morbid disorders and pioglitazone through activation of ppar receptors alleviated the  altered plasma glucose or insulin resistance  and exhibited antidepressant - like effect
in conclusion , in the present study chronic treatment with ppar agonist , pioglitazone reversed the cums induced behavioral and biochemical changes in obese mice , thus exhibiting antidepressive - like effect .
the chronic consumption of hfd risks the anxiety and depressive - like behavior , heightens the hpa axis response to stress and leads to several biochemical modifications ( sharma and fulton , 2012 ) .
. however , these are only the preliminary findings and hence , further studies dealing with the role of pioglitazone with respect to molecular mechanisms including brain derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , corticosterone levels , mrna expression in cortex and hippocampus in depression associated with obesity will shade light on the mechanism aspects .
