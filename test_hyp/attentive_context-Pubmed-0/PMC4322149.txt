the purpose of this study was to examine the association between serum levels of adipocytokines ( leptin and visfatin ) and radiographic joint damage in patients with ra .
this study was conducted on 29 patients with erosive rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) and 25 patients with non - erosive ra .
leptin showed correlation with bmi ( t=4.096 , p<0.001 ) and visfatin showed positive correlations with c - reactive protein ( crp ) and disease duration ( t=2.165 , p=0.035 and t=2.719 , p=0.009 respectively ) .
the median disease durations were 5 years ( iqr ( 3 - 5 ) ) and 2 years ( iqr ( 1 - 4.5 ) ) in patients with erosive and non - erosive ra , respectively ; which showed statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients ( p=0.003 ) .
visfatin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with erosive ra ( 34.6 [ 29.1 - 100 ] ng / ml ) compared with non - erosive ra ( 28.4 [ 22.1 - 34.5 ] ng / ml ) ( p=0.013 ) ( table 1 ) .   leptin and visfatin correlations with bmi , disease duration and larsen score are shown in table 2 .
