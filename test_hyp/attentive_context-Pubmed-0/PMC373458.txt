the gift of the reagents to measure prolactin , lh and fsh levels by the niddk 's national hormone and pituitary program and dr .
we measured the daily pattern of plasma prolactin , luteinizing hormone ( lh ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) and testosterone levels at 6 different time points within a 24-h cycle in growing male rats kept in isolation or group - caged for 30 days .
our results indicate that social isolation of young male rats for 30 days brings about changes in the 24-h variation of pituitary - testicular function .
overall , the secretion of prolactin , lh and testosterone decreased whereas that of fsh augmented in isolated rats .
significant effects of time of day ( f5,77= 8.71 , p < 0.00001 ) and a significant interaction " time of day  treatment " occurred ( f5,77= 21.9 , p < 0.00001 ) , i.e. , the maximum in circulating testosterone took place at 1700 h in controls and at 2100 h in isolated rats and the decrease of plasma testosterone in isolated rats was seen only during the light phase of daily photoperiod ( fig .
18 , single housed rats continued to spend much more time apparently attempting to escape ( sniffing and chewing at the bars and suddenly dashing around their cage ) while those housed in groups spent more time sleeping and feeding .
