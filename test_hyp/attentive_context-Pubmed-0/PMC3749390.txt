the effect of different carbon sources on antibiotic production by the strain is presented in fig .
6 . among different minerals tested only k2hpo4 and mgso47h2o had positive effects on antibiotic production followed by nacl , kcl and kh2po4
the effect of ph and temperature on antimicrobial metabolites production by the strain is presented in fig . 2 and 3 .
the production of antimicrobial metabolites at different days was determined by disc diffusion assay method measuring the zone of inhibition against b. subtilis .
the organism produced high levels of antibiotic production when culture medium incubated at 39. therefore the strain was strictly mesophilic for secondary metabolites production .
1 ) . thus the organism was allowed to incubate for 10 days for the production of antimicrobial metabolites .
no antibiotic was produced when the medium was supplemented with galactose , lactose , raffinose and maltose as a sole carbon source .
carbohydrates such as glycerol , maltose , lactose and some others are known to have interference with the production of secondary metabolites ( demain and fang , 1995 ) . in the present study , the strain was found to produce high levels of antimicrobial metabolites in the medium supplemented with glucose ( 2% ) as sole carbon source . in case of streptomyces species , with regards to carbon sources
