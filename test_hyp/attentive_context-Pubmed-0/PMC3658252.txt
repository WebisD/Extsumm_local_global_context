plasma cell leukemia ( pcl ) is a rare disease that represents approximately 4% of plasma cell malignant disorders.1 diagnosis of pcl is established based on kyle s criteria , which includes an absolute plasma cell number accounting for greater than 2000/l or 20% of white blood cell differentiation.2 pcl consists of two variants : primary pcl presents in patients with no previous history of multiple myeloma ( mm ) , while secondary pcl consists of a leukemic transformation in previously recognized mm.3 primary pcl is an extremely resistant , rapidly progressive , fatal disease , with a median overall survival of 6.8 months.4 there is no standard therapeutic strategy because none of the treatment options have been prospectively evaluated .
we have a successful case of newly diagnosed primary pcl , treated with a regimen that included bortezomib and asct , followed by nonmyeloablative allo - sct .
