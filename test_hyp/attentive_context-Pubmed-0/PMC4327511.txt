the aim of this review article was to summarize and discuss the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of materials used for protection of the dentin - pulp complex , some components of resin composites and adhesive systems when in direct or indirect contact with the pulp tissue .
based on this literature review , it may be concluded that : calcium hydroxide products are the best choice for conservative treatment of the pulp due to their therapeutic and biological potential and the property of stimulating the formation of sclerotic and reparative dentin as well as protecting the pulp against thermal stimuli .
the main purpose of restorative dentistry is to restore and maintain tooth health by an adequate restorative treatment in order to protect and re - establish pulp function .
cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of materials used in dentistry have been widely studied in different cell cultures or in deep cavities with or without pulp exposure .
monomers present in resin composites and adhesive systems ( e.g. : bisgma , udma , tegdma , hema ) have been shown to have cytotoxic effects as a consequence of direct contact with fibroblasts and may be leached during the polymerization when the conversion degree is not fully reached . in human pulps ,
