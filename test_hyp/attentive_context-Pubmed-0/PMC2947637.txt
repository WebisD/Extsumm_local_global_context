we review the risks and underlying factors that promote presenteeism , and propose novel solutions in light of its importance to public health , the safety of our health care workforce , and the health of our patients .
in the current era of frequent international travel and novel pandemic influenza virus outbreaks , vigilance is required to ensure that appropriate , common sense infection control procedures are in place , including enforcement of policies preventing health care staff from working while they are potentially infectious .
we describe a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in a long - term care facility in which presenteeism was a key risk factor in disease transmission and extension of the outbreak .
on january 19 , 2005 ( day 1 ) , three nursing home residents and one staff member at a 100-bed , two - floor urban facility developed symptoms of nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea ( fig .  1 ) .
these policies should include the availability of unrestricted paid sick leave , systematic processes for screening ill employees , and mandatory exclusion rules .
, few studies have reported this relationship between presenteeism and infectious disease transmission in health care settings .
