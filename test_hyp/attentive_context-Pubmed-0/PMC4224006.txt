we report a 64-year - old female with a 37-year history of severe hailey - hailey disease involving her whole body .
hailey - hailey disease ( hhd ) , otherwise known as familial benign chronic pemphigus is a rare autosomal dominant , acantholytic disease with incomplete penetrance that is characterized by recurrent blisters , plaques , and erosions often accompanied by a burning or pruritic sensation .
the patient s hhd has been unresponsive to common therapies used in the management of hhd .
in addition , the efficacy of oral alitretinoin as a mono - therapy for hhd should be explored .
in conclusion , we suggest that conjunctive therapy of oral alitretinoin with narrowband uvb therapy be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of hhd to be followed by a mono - therapy of alitretinoin . the use of oral alitretinoin and narrowband uvb therapy should be explored further .
in 2005 , a then 55-year - old caucasian female presented with clinical signs and symptoms of hhd , which had been active for 32 years .
it is caused by a mutation in the atp2c1 gene on chromosome 3q21-q24 , which encodes a disrupted golgi associated ca atpase .
