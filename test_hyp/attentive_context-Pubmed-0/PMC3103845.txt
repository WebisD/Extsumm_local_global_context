undoubtedly , hplc is one of the most widely used techniques in routine analysis of pharmaceuticals , but it involves expensive instrumental set which many laboratories in developing and underdeveloped countries can not afford . the proposed equilibrium spectrophotometric method based on the coupled redox - complexation reaction of the thiol drug nac or mpg with fe(iii ) and tptz can be applied in every analytical laboratory as a reliable method for the determination of nac or mpg in pharmaceutical preparations . due to the use of tptz
the coloured fe(tptz)2 
  complex is stable in an extended period of time up to 24 hours .
the accuracy of the method was further ascertained through the recovery studies . to the drug solutions of the granules or the tablet powder , the standard solutions of the synthetic nac or mpg
the linearity of the method was investigated under the optimized conditions for nac and mpg in the concentration range from 1.0 to 100.0  m .
the effect of some possible interfering cations and anions on the analysis of a fixed concentration of 40.0  m for nac and mpg was investigated for the maximum molar ratio of foreign ions .
regular excipients and additives present in the pharmaceutical preparations of nac and mpg do not interfere in this method .
