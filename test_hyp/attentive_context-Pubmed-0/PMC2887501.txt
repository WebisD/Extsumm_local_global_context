the focus of this review is to discuss recent developments in raas biology of potential clinical relevance to chronic kidney disease and the potential impact of direct renin inhibition on the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease .
angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) slow the progression of chronic kidney disease  and are recommended as first line therapy in the treatment of this disease . over the past few years our understanding of the complexity and pervasive effects of the raas has grown as new components , functions and regulatory steps have been identified . moreover , a new drug class , direct renin inhibitors , has been developed that offers another therapeutic option to suppress the raas in cardiorenal diseases .
the importance of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( raas ) in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease is widely appreciated , and this understanding is due largely to the results obtained with pharmacologic agents that block the system .
chronic kidney disease is a major healthcare problem that will likely continue to increase due to the ageing population and the elevated prevalence of hypertension , diabetes and obesity .
