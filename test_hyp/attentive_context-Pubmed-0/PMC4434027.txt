the 
 purpose of this case report is to present the effects of vestibular stimulation on a child 
 with hypotonic cerebral palsy through the use of swings .
cerebral palsy ( cp ) is a non - progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that includes a wide 
 spectrum of syndromes related to the early onset of posture and motor impairment1 .
the subject was a 19-month - old boy with a diagnosis of hypotonic cerebral palsy ( cp ) and 
 oscillating nystagmus .
future studies should also look at the effectiveness of sensory integration 
 and ndt in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy .
, he started to 
 receive therapy for developmental delays , including hospital based occupational therapy 2 
 times per week , physical therapy using the neurodevelopmental treatment ( ndt ) technique and 
 the vojta method 2 times per week , and sensory stimulation once a week .
this case was referred to this author via the child s occupational therapist who felt the 
 child would benefit from this study .
therefore , further research with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the 
 effectiveness of vestibular inputs through the use of swings on children with hypotonic 
 cerebral palsy .
the subject s mental raw score was 21 with a corresponding developmental age of 1 month , 
 and his motor raw score was 40 with a corresponding developmental age of 6 months , 
 pre - intervention .
