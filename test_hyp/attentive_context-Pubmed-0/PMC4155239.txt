horse riding simulation training may reduce the distance and speed of the 
 center of gravity movements of stroke patients and reduce the asymmetry of the abdominal 
 muscles . to improve stroke patients balance ability , diverse uses of horse riding 
 simulation training should be considered .
no studies have been conducted on the changes in muscles related to stroke patients 
 stability and balance after hippotherapy . in this study , the improvement in stroke patients 
 trunk control and changes in abdominal muscle thicknesses after horse riding simulation 
 training were examined .
this study examined the effects of horse riding simulation training on the improvement of 
 balance ability ( which is an important issue for stroke patients ) , and the changes in 
 abdominal muscle thicknesses of stroke patients . the distance and speed of center of gravity 
 movements
patients willing to participate in the study were recruited , 
 and those who satisfied the selection criteria were randomly assigned to a control or 
 experimental group ( 15 patients per group ) .
the horse riding simulator ( eu6441 core muscle trainer ; panasonic , japan ) used is designed 
 to simulate the effects of horse riding exercises in an indoor environment using 
 three - directional movements ( anterior - posterior , lateral , upward - downward ) , and has three 
 different programs and nine levels of exercise intensity .
