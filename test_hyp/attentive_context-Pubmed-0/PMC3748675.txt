there is inter - individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of isoflurane in humans . during the initial period rate of uptake
our aim was to provide enough vapours to wash - in the circuit volume and patients functional residual capacity ( frc ) to 1.5% vapour concentration and in addition 3 unit doses ( according to sqrt principle ) within 9 min .
we had decided to achieve et - iso of 1.5% within 5 - 10 min for gradual build - up of concentration , avoiding excess over pressurization and hypotensions in anaesthetized patients thus try to maintain a stable co to study uptake .
the anaesthesiologist is more interested in attaining a desired minimum alveolar concentration ( mac ) as the parameter and not the pharmacokinetics of the agent . by studying the rate of uptake of isoflurane during our pilot cases , we modified the dosages derived from lowe and ernst equation into a simplified form of rate of liquid isoflurane injection into the circle system using low flow anaesthesia .
note the stability from 40 min onwards . * p<0.05 ; * * p<0.01 individual rates of infusion of isoflurane per kg ideal body weight per h. the different rates of infusion depict inter - individual variability for the same end tidal after functional residual capacity and circuit wash in correlation of cumulative isoflurane uptake ( at 30 min ) and measured patients variables .
