how does the pattern of retinal activity produced by looking at the image of halle berry ultimately lead to the perception of the actress rather than a violin ? how do the myriad different associations with halle berry ( actress , specific roles ) or violin ( inanimate object , music ) form through learning and memory ?
we will discuss the development of genetic techniques that bridge the divide between these two approaches and allow the targeting of molecular changes specifically to anatomically dispersed neural representations that are activated by discrete environmental stimuli .
the increased specificity along with the new genetic tools and biochemical tagging should provide a new level of circuit analysis in the brain and break down the barrier between watching neural firing and manipulating neural function .
they have been approached by a variety of techniques that fall into two broad categories , watching brain activity and disrupting brain function . in this review
historically much of what we know about the functional parceling of the brain has been obtained from lesion studies in experimental animals and in patients with damage to specific brain regions ( squire , 2004 ) . in learning and memory , studies of patient hm , who underwent a bilateral resection of the medial temporal lobe , have helped define this area , and in particular the hippocampal formation , as critical in the formation of long - lasting declarative memories . at a more molecular level
