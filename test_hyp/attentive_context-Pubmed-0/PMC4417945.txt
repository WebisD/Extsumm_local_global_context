the aim of this study was to determine the subtype of blastocystis in infected cattle in khorramabad city , iran , using seven pairs of sts primers .
the obtained sequences were compared to the sequences reported in gene bank and the results showed high homology with blastocyctis sp .
the lack of determination for four subtypes of the 19 positive samples , as reported in previous studies , may be due to genotype diversity , implying that only some of them are known ( 28 ) .
finally , it seems that gathering epidemiological data , ie , identification of zoonotic isolates at the subtype level , is needed for a better understanding of the potential animal reservoirs for human infection .
this study was the first to investigate the blastocystis subtype in cattle using molecular methods in iran . in the present study , the highest prevalence was for st5 which is so important for epidemiology and risk of human infection .
this descriptive cross - sectional study was performed on 196 isolates from cattle stool samples collected from slaughterhouse in khorramabad city , iran , in 2012 .
it was performed for the first time in iran as an introduction to future studies of subtype prevalence in other animals , also assessing the effect of subtypes on pathogenicity of parasites in animals , particularly in cattle .
