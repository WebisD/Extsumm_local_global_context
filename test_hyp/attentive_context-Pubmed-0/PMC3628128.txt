an example of h mrs study in patient with initial diagnosis of mci and clinical deterioration during 2 years of follow - up with final diagnosis of ad is presented in ( figure 4 ) ( a  initial h mrs , and after final diagnosis , control h mrs study 
this study attempted to evaluate the regional metabolic disorders using h mrs within the frontal , external and medial temporal lobes in patients with mci , as a predictor of clinical deterioration to dementia based on clinical follow - up .
h mrs seems to be a very sensitive method that provides biochemical information using an in vivo approach in patients with initial mci , who in significant numbers developed disease progression and/or converted to ad .
statistical analyses of baseline metabolic ratios measurement using h mrs between the final 3 groups of patients , ( sd , dp and ad ) found significant difference in frontal lobes in mi / h20 ratio on left , between patients with stable disease ( 0.27 ) and those with progression ( 0.22 ) ( p=0.03 ) ( figure 1 ) . in the groups of patients with dp and those with conversion to ad
