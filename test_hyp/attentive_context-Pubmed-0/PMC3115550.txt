we found that greater methylation of rxra chr9:136355885 + measured at birth was strongly correlated with greater adiposity in later childhood in two independent cohorts .
account of rxra chr9:136355885 + methylation and sex explained 26% of the variance in fat mass in pah children , and simultaneous analyses showed that the association between rxra chr9:136355885 + methylation and child s fat mass was not attenuated after adjustment for birth weight and mother s age , smoking , and bmi .
comparison of the regression coefficients for the univariate and multivariate associations of rxra chr9:136355885 + and enos chr7:150315553 + methylation with child s fat mass , % fat , and ratio of trunk to limb fat shows that mutual adjustment for each other and sex has little effect on the coefficients ; adiposity measurements were therefore preadjusted for sex in further analyses .
fourth , the association between rxra chr9:136355885 + methylation and mother s carbohydrate intake raises the possibility that conditions in early pregnancy could affect child s adiposity through this pathway .
our observation that adjacent or nearby cpgs within the same promoter showed differences in the strength of association with child s adiposity suggests highly specific changes in the transcriptional regulation of these genes induced by the developmental environment , rather than generalized changes in promoter methylation . both cpg hyper- ( enos chr7:150315553 + and rxra chr9:136355885 + ) and hypomethylation ( sod1 chr21:31853660/63 + ) at different sites were associated with body fat distribution , again indicating complexity in transcriptional control .
