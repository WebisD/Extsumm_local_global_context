viral mimic polyinosinic : polycytidylic acid [ poli ( i : c ) ] resembles the structure of double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) generated in host cells during viral replication , and it is recognized by tlr3 that activates the innate immune response . the administration of poly ( i : c ) is a way to trigger the innate immune response , which mimics the early phase of viral infections , and avoids the use of infectious agents , and treatments can be standardized and experiments may be easily compared .
this review presents possible implications of glial toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) and cx hc and panx channels activation after potentiation by stress in cns dysfunctions .   during pregnancy ,
signaling between nervous and immune systems is in part due to the fact that these two systems share ligands and receptors .
also , glucocorticoids ( gcs ) play a relevant role in stress - induced potentiation of neuroinflammatory responses by sensitizing microglia to proinflammatory stimuli . as part of these responses , glial tlrs , connexin hemichannels ( cx hcs ) ,
notably , the innate host defense has been demonstrated to play an active role in promoting neurodegeneration   .
