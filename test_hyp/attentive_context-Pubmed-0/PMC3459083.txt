1loteprednol etabonate ( i ) and its inactive metabolites ,  cortienic acid etabonate ( ii ) and  cortienic acid ( iii ) loteprednol etabonate ( i ) and its inactive metabolites ,  cortienic acid etabonate ( ii ) and  cortienic acid ( iii ) the objective of this paper was to review the available published clinical data on loteprednol etabonate suspension 0.5  % in the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain , and to assess its efficacy and safety along with that of other corticosteroids formally studied and approved for the treatment of postoperative inflammation , namely , difluprednate and rimexolone .
the use of loteprednol etabonate , however , seems to be associated with fewer clinically significant increases in iop ( 10  mmhg ) , thereby reducing the risk of corticosteroid - induced ocular hypertension and eventual corticosteroid - induced glaucoma .
as evidenced by a comprehensive review of the data from published studies , loteprednol etabonate is effective in resolving anterior chamber cells and flare as well as in reducing postoperative pain and discomfort .
based on the available data , loteprednol etabonate offers efficacy similar to older corticosteroids such as prednisolone acetate , with a much - reduced effect on iop , thereby presenting an improved safety profile as compared to these older compounds .
