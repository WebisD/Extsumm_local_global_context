most ankle sprain injuries involve the region of the lateral malleolus and its ligament complex ( the lateral ligament complex of the ankle joint ) which consists of three ligaments : anterior talofibular ligament ( atfl ) , calcaneofibular ligament ( cfl ) and posterior talofibular ligament ( ptfl ) .
x - ray examinations of the ankle joint were conducted in three views : a - p , lateral and  mortise view  ( used for the assessment of the width of the tibiofibular syndesmosis and for the optimization of the talocrural joint space imaging ) .
the aim of this paper is to draw attention to the usefulness of the ultrasound examination in the diagnosis of recent sprain injuries of the ankle joint .
the retrospective analysis involved 206 patients ( 113 girls and 93 boys ) who reported to the trauma outpatient clinic with recent ankle joint sprain . the average age of the patients was 10.6 .
sprain injuries are diagnosed in 6% of young people who practice sports , and the highest risk is associated with the following sports : soccer , rugby , hockey , handball , volleyball , basketball and squash .
a us examination of the ankle joint is characterized by greater sensitivity in assessing avulsion injuries .
