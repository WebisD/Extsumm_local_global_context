the aim of this article was to highlight this aspect of megaloblastic anemia and the importance of considering this diagnosis in all cases presenting with puo .
this study was conducted on 15 patients of megaloblastic anemia associated with fever , attending the outpatient department over a period of 6 months ( june 2014 to november 2014 ) .
the correct identification of b12/folate deficiency being the cause of fever ( after all other causes have been ruled out ) , would help in adequate and timely management of the patient and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics .
the inclusion criteria for the study were temperature of 100 f ( 37.8c ) or more , hemoglobin level < 10 g / dl , mean corpuscular volume ( mcv ) > 100 fl , peripheral blood film findings consistent with megaloblastosis ( including macrocytosis , hypersegmented neutrophils and pancytopenia in few cases ) , low serum vitamin b12 and/or folate levels , and bone marrow findings consistent with megaloblastic anemia .
we conclude that though infection remains to be the most common cause of pyrexia in patients of megaloblastic anemia , few cases also show a causal relationship between the two .
