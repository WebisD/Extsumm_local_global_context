conditional analysis in stage 1 samples suggested that neither of the snps were likely to be the snp driving the association ( p  0.11 ) .
although no heterogeneity of effect was observed between chinese hans and europeans , the risk allele frequency of rs7403531 in chinese hans was moderately higher than in europeans ( 0.33 and 0.28 in hapmap chb and ceu populations , respectively ) .
the risk allele frequency of grk5-rs10886471 in chinese hans was also much higher than in europeans ( 0.79 and 0.48 in hapmap chb and ceu populations , respectively ) , and the corresponding population attributable risk in chinese hans was estimated to be 8.66% .
the t2d risk - increasing c - allele of rs10886471 was significantly associated with increased mrna expression levels of grk5 ( p[dom ] = 0.02 ) with the same direction of effect in both t2d case subjects and control subjects , consistent with the finding in the genevar eqtl database .
snps reaching genome - wide significance in a meta - analysis of combined stages 1 , 2 , and 3 the association between rasgrp1-rs7403531 and t2d was confirmed by results from diagram plus gwas meta - analysis ( 22 ) ( 8,130 t2d case and 38,987 control subjects of european origin ) , with comparable effect size and consistent direction ( p = 0.023 ; or = 1.06 ; p for heterogeneity between east asians and europeans = 0.22 ) , and two imputed snps ( rs8043085 and rs12593201 , r  0.8 with rs7403531 ) at this locus even showed a stronger association ( p  3.82  10 ; or = 1.07 ) in european populations from the diagram consortium ( supplementary tables 8 and 13 ) .
