it would also have positive implications for functional genomics , because it would be the first time the strategy of finding a gene with a positional cloning approach and subsequent functional analysis and characterization of the pathogenetic mechanism had been able to lead to a causal therapy of an illness .
hd begins gradually with mood disturbances , increasing involuntary movements ( chorea ) , and cognitive impairment , finally leading to dystonia and severe dementia .
in addition to atrophy in the striatum , extensive neuronal cell loss also occurs in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex , white matter , hippocampus , amygdala , and thalamus . 

all grades exhibit a loss of brain weight ( up to 30% ) resulting from neuronal cell death . the extent of neuronal cell death is directly related to the severity of disease . in the basal ganglia ,
we therefore propose that formation of aggregates and subsequently of inclusion bodies is a key step in the development of late - onset progressive neurodegenerative disorders .
since the identification of the gene for huntington 's chorea in 1993 , this would represent a major milestone in hd research and also in molecular medicine generally , because for the first time a causal therapy for an inherited disease would be within reach .
