in this study , we examined the immunoexpression of il-23 and il-17 in the lesional biopsy specimens from 10 cases of pv , comparing the results with those of pf patients and normal control skins from 6 healthy individuals , and evaluated the correlation between il-23 + cells and il-17 + cells ; moreover , the sources of il-23 were also evaluated .
in the current research , we examined the lesions and found that both il-23 and il-17 were overexpressed in pv patients , compared to the healthy controls and pf patients .
in conclusion , our present study provides evidence that the expression of il-23 and il-17 was elevated and correlated in pv patients , which suggested the crucial role of the il-23/il-17 axis in the development of pv and provided us with some clues for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of pv .
in this descriptive - analytical study , the subjects were 10 ( 3 men and 7 women ) unrelated patients with pv and 3 ( 1 man and 2 women ) patients with pemphigus foliaceus ( pf ) diagnosed by clinical and immunohistochemical criteria .
the counts of il-23 + cells in each 200x field of view in pv lesions and normal control skin were 73.70  5.315 and 29.50  4.448 , respectively ( figure 3(a ) , p < 0.05 ) , while the numbers of il-17 + cells in each 200x field of view in pv lesions and normal control skin were 46.60  5.673 and 9.50  3.354 , respectively ( figure 3(b ) , p < 0.05 ) . besides
