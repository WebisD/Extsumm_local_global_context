a strong pulsatory signal correlated with the severity of acute cholecystitis with both csmi and msmi and may be suitable for the evaluation of the severity of this condition .
, we present the changes observed using csmi and msmi over the course of an acute cholecystitis in 1 patient .
smi is expected to reduce the incidence of false negatives when diagnosing this condition . in the present case , the strength of the pulsatory signals correlated with the severity of the gallbladder inflammation , as illustrated using both csmi and msmi .
abdominal us is recommended as a first - line diagnostic imaging tool for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis ; however , false negatives are a known issue of this technique . in our case , a pulsatory signal was observed on the wall of the gallbladder on the day of admission , which suggested positive csmi , even when wall thickening was minimal .
abdominal ultrasonography ( us ) is useful for the diagnosis of diseases of the abdominal cavity . with abdominal us ,
acute cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder due to obstruction of the neck or cystic duct , primarily caused by gallstones .
