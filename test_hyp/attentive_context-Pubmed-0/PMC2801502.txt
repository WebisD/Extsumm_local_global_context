the self - administered 24-h recall showed higher consumption of fresh fruit particularly for middle - aged and older women , which is in line with results from a recent finnish study ( 18 ) . on the other hand
although total consumption seems to have increased , the role of other underlying factors besides the sociodemographic factors and pa studied here remains unclear .
women with 0.5 h self - reported pa / week had lower f&v consumption than those reporting 1 h pa / week ( p<0.001 ) . also among men , those reporting 0.5 h pa / week had lower f&v consumption than those reporting 2.5 h pa / week .
comparisons between women and men within each age group showed that 55- to 74-year - old women consumed more fruits in total ( p0.001 ) , and more fresh fruits ( p0.002 ) , than men .
fresh f&v showed the highest consumption , whereas berries and processed f&v products were less popular .
however , the methodology used in the present study differed from the latest national food intake survey ( 13 ) , and the results are not directly comparable with each others . in line with our findings , previous studies have also shown that men tend to have lower f&v consumption than women ( 1518 ) .
