we report a highly facile method for the preparation of scalable large - area go .
, we have identified key factors contributing to the large area of go formed , which are complete oxidation of graphite through a high degree of oxidation and the need to carry out the reaction at room temperature .
the method was carried out at room temperature with the highest conversion possible ( 100% conversion of graphite flakes to go ) to produce large - area go without ultrasonication . here
furthermore , the mixing and washing steps are simple and straightforward , yielding an almost 100% conversion of large - area go . to study the effect of oxidation level we used kmno4:acid ( h2so4:h3po4 ) at the weight ratios of 1:80 , 1:40 , and 1:20 ( hereon denoted as ks-80 , ks-40 , and ks-20 , respectively , where the weight ratio of h2so4:h3po4 was fixed at 9:1 ) and the weight ratio of graphite : sulfuric acid
our method of synthesizing go will infinitely increase the rate of go production for numerous investigations , which might appeal to biologists , chemists , physicists , and materials scientists .
current methods of producing go using chemical oxidation like hummer s method,20 staudeumaier s method,21 and brodie s method22 involved tedious and long experimental time . here , the experimental time does not refer to the time required to oxidize the graphite flakes but rather the time spent by a researcher working on the experiment during the oxidation process .
