our results show that the serum testosterone level at the time of diagnosis was unrelated to psa and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness .
other recent epidemiologic studies also have found no association between testosterone and prostate cancer [ 6 - 10 ] . our main objective was to analyze the relationship between serum testosterone , prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) , and prostate cancer risk in high - risk patients .
additional studies with long - term follow - up are needed to explain the possible mechanism and relationship between testosterone , prostate cancer , and psa .
, the present study found that the serum testosterone level at the time of diagnosis was unrelated to psa and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness . because testosterone levels change with age and time , a prospective study with long - term testosterone monitoring is required to find a relationship between testosterone and prostate cancer .
the testosterone level did not differ significantly between patients without and those with prostate cancer in either hypogonadal ( 248.1650.41 ng / dl vs. 251.3543.61 ng / dl , respectively ) or eugonadal ( 501.52137.06 ng / dl vs. 506.22126.40 ng / dl , respectively ) men ( t - test , p>0.05 ) .
