the positive correlation between axl expression levels and tumor 
 invasiveness in multiple cancer types makes cu - dota - h173 
 potentially clinically useful for staging axl - positive cancers and 
 managing patients with axl - targeted therapy .
, we radiolabeled h173 
 with cu to create an antibody based pet probe to noninvasively 
 quantify axl expression in vivo .
this study shows that cu - dota - h173 , 
 based on a humanized axl - specific monoclonal antibody , displays high 
 target specificity both in vitro and in vivo .
we have developed a receptor - targeted pet probe for detection of 
 axl - positive tumors .
the data obtaining by pet imaging could be used to confirm 
 the presence of axl , which would be important clinical information 
 in determining the utility of axl - targeted chemo- and radiotherapy 
 in receptor positive patients . in this study
cu - dota - h173 
 uptake in a549 tumors increased with time , and a better tumor - to - background 
 contrast was displayed at late time points ( 28 h , 45 h p.i . ) . both 
 active uptake ( contributed by h173-axl interaction ) and passive uptake 
 ( contributed by the enhanced permeability and retention effect )
