sertoliform endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary ( sec ) is an uncommon variant that bears histologic similarity to sertoli and sertoli - leydig cell tumors ( slts ) .
a 55-year - old postmenopausal female patient presented with mass per abdomen since 2 years and pain for 2 days .
recognition of this tumor is important as it is a well - differentiated , low - grade malignancy that displays a good prognosis when confined to the ovary .
the case is presented for its rarity . in view of relatively good prognosis of sec as compared to endometrioid tumor , identifying this variant by an extensive sampling of the specimen is mandatory .
endometrioid carcinoma of ovary resembling sex cord - stromal tumor is a rare variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma that focally looks like a sex cord - stromal tumor with sertoli , leydig , or granulosa cells .
our case is graded as well - differentiated ( grade 1 ) based on the histological features of foci of conventional endometrioid carcinoma .
individual tumor cells having vesicular nuclei , prominent nucleoli , and moderate cytoplasm ( h and e , 400 ) microphotograph showing foci of conventional endometrioid carcinoma ( h and e , 400 ) microphotograph showing foci of conventional endometrioid carcinoma and sertoli cell tumor - like pattern ( h and e , 200 ) immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) showed tumor cells strongly immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen ( ema ) , cytokeratin ( ck ) but negative for inhibin [ figures 68 ] , thus confirming the diagnosis of sec of left ovary .
