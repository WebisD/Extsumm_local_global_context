, we conducted a phase i , randomized , double - blind , 
 placebo - controlled trial of vaginal l. 
 crispatus ctv-05 in premenopausal women with a history of recurrent uti .
in phase i , placebo - controlled trial , use of a l. crispatus ctv-05 vaginal suppository , 
 for the prevention of recurrent uti was well tolerated with minimal side effects .
there were no serious adverse events , and 
 despite the occurrence of abnormal vaginal discharge and external genital or 
 vaginal irritation in several women , compliance was high .
l. crispatus ctv-05 use was associated 
 with pyuria ( detected by microscopy and urine leukocyte - esterase ) in seven women 
 at either the 1- or 4-week visits ( p = .04 at 4 weeks ) .
l. crispatus ctv-05 is 
 well tolerated when given as a vaginal suppository to healthy women with a 
 history of recurrent uti .
however , 
 given the frequency of recurrent vaginal candidiasis experienced by subjects 
 prior to enrollment and the prevalence of candida in baseline vaginal cultures , the relationship of this condition to study drug 
 use is not compelling .  
women surveyed after participation in a clinical trial of a vaginal 
 capsule formulation of l. crispatus ctv-05 
 for treatment of bacterial vaginosis rarely reported adverse effects , and those 
 reported were largely related to a perceived difference in vaginal 
 discharge . satisfaction with the vaginal 
 capsule was high .
