correlations between changes in mean flow mediated dilation ( fmd ) of the brachial artery with changes in biochemical parameters after 4 hours and 1 month drinking grape and/or pomegranate juices in adolescents with metabolic syndrome
these sustained effects on markers of endothelium function are consistent with the findings of a recent trial among hypertensive adults , which documented a dose - response relationship between increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and improved fmd.10 mets may result from interactions of vascular abnormalities , oxidative stress , visceral fat , inflammation , adipocytokines , and cortisol , as part of the larger environment of obesity and insulin resistance , and under the influence of genetic and ethnic predispositions.11 in adults it has been documented that mets is associated with endothelial dysfunction as assessed by fmd of brachial artery.1213 recent studies confirmed this association in the pediatric age group.11415 up - regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules , including endothelial - leukocyte adhesion molecule ( se - selectin ) , intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sicam-1 ) , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( svcam-1 ) , play a crucial role in the earliest phases of atherosclerosis.1617 inflammation markers and soluble adhesion molecules concentrations have been found to be higher in the obese than in the lean children.1819 higher levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in children with mets and obesity2021 suggest early stages of endothelial dysfunction in obese children.2224 in this study , juices with anti - oxidant properties improved these markers and they might be beneficial for prevention and control of atherosclerotic diseases .
