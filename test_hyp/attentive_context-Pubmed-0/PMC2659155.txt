many states enacted patients bill of rights laws.2,3 the concept of patients rights represents a cultural shift that began to emerge 40  years ago when notions of informed consent and autonomy were first endorsed by court opinion and institutional policy.4,5 in 1973 , the american hospital association ( aha ) presented the first patients bill of rights.6 the 12 themes addressed in this initial document ( e.g. , right to respectful care , right to refuse treatment , right to confidentiality , right to refuse participation in research ) have remained in subsequent versions ( table  1 ) , and in the 1990s the joint commission phased in a requirement to inform every patient about their rights as a national standard for hospital accreditation ( ri.2.20 ) . 

we performed the following three additional analyses of state pbor statutes : 1 ) comparison of the rights delineated in state law to the themes advanced in the 2002 version of the american hospital association pbor ; 2 ) abstraction of any enforcement powers that are delineated within the statute ; and 3 ) evaluation of the presence of pbor texts in languages other than english for those states with mandatory language defined within the statute .
