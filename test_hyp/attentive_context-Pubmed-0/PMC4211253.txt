the present study was designed to determine vitamin d status and search for possible associations between serum vitamin d concentration and metabolic parameters in persons with obesity and t2d in this country .
the main finding in this cross - sectional study is the very high prevalence ( 83.2% ) of vitamin d deficiency ( < 50  nmol / l ) , with a mean s-25(oh)d of 33.8  20.3 
serum concentrations of 25(oh)d were not associated with any particular characteristics of the glycemic profile but were strongly associated with bmi , wc , and fat mass , markers of calcium homeostasis and cardiometabolic parameter .
the mean levels of fbg , hba1c , ldl - c , and crp were higher than the recommended target , and hdl - c levels were lower ( ada guidelines ) .
the main finding of this cross - sectional study is the very high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our sample of the emirati population with obesity and t2d .
our results confirm and augment the body of evidence that vitamin d deficiency is alarmingly high among people in the uae with diabetes and obesity . in the present study there was no significant difference in vitamin d status between males and females ( 35.1  19.2
