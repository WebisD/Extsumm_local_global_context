we also assessed the role of these behavioral factors separately in high risk sub groups : children of mothers with overweight and children of mothers with low education .
the aim of this study was to identify specific behavioral risk factors for overweight in young children and to assess their quantitative contribution to the prevalence of overweight in the general population and in high risk sub groups . in a large population - based birth cohort , we prospectively investigated associations between dietary habits , screen time and physical activity when the children were 5 and 7 years old and overweight at the age of 8 years .
reduction of screen time should be part of interventions to prevent or reduce overweight in young children and could result in a reduction of overweight prevalence in the order of 2 percentage points in both high and low risk sub groups .
the association between maternal overweight and overweight in the child weakened only marginally in the model including behavioral risk factors ( 5% change in regression coefficient from 1.07 to 1.02 ) , indicating that the association between maternal overweight and overweight of the child is only to a limited extent mediated by the behavioral factors studied ( see table 2 , model 4 ) .
