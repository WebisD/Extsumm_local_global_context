. additionally , there are no reports of cytokine concentrations in humans 15 days after 
 the beginning of treatment ; therefore , the data presented here could for the first time 
 indicate a shift from a th1/th2 balanced response to a more pronounced th1-regulated 
 immune response during the first 15 days of uncomplicated malaria treatment in brazilian 
 endemic areas .
the findings of our study show that increased 
 band cells and low lymphocyte and eosinophil counts are common during acute p. 
 falciparum and p. vivax malaria .
, il-10 predominated in the 
 early anti - inflammatory response in p. falciparum and p. vivax - infected patients and 
 dropped drastically during the convalescent phase when malaria had been cured in all 
 patients . in conclusion ,
a complex array of cytokines is released in adult patients with 
 uncomplicated malaria infection with apparent feedback inhibition and cross - regulatory 
 functions .
g - csf : 
 granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ; ifn : interferon ; il : interleukin ; mip : 
 macrophage inflammatory protein ; tnf : tumour necrosis factor . 
  the levels of il-1 , il-4 and il-12 were similar to those of the controls during the 
 acute phase for both p. falciparum and p. vivax patients and were higher during the 
 convalescent phase , with the exception of il-12 , which was higher only in the p. 
 falciparum group .
