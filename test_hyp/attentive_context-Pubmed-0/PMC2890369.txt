overall , strong and mostly linear dose - response associations of the change in total ltpa with the development and resolution of the mets were seen .
increased moderate - to - vigorous ltpa during the 4.1-year follow - up increased the likelihood for the mets to resolve and decreased the likelihood for the mets to develop , independently of changes in diet and body weight . moreover , increased moderate - to - vigorous ltpa decreased the prevalence of hyperglycemia .
physical activity and resistance training also more specifically had benefits with respect to hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia , but improvements in abdominal obesity were not clearly seen .
some also encountered difficulties with transportation and time schedules . in conclusion , increased participation in moderate - to - vigorous physical activity and regular long - term participation in resistance training improved the mets status among men and women with impaired glucose tolerance in the finnish dps .
the resolution of the mets was seen in 29.7 versus 19.1% ( p = 0.004 ) , and the development of mets was seen in 23.5 versus 44.7% ( p = 0.041 ) in the upper versus lower third of change in moderate - to - vigorous ltpa .
