is very difficult . currently , there is no user - friendly tool supporting methods for the detection of recurrent or phenotype - specific mutations . in this study , in order to support the definition of recurrent mutations or phenotype - specific mutations from ngs data of a group of cancers with diverse phenotypes , we aimed to develop a user - friendly tool , named mutation arranger for defining phenotype - related snv ( map ) .
map is a user - friendly program with multiple functions that supports the determination of recurrent or phenotype - specific mutations and provides graphic illustration images to the users .
its operation environment , microsoft windows , enables more researchers who can not operate linux to define clinically meaningful mutations with ngs data from cancer cohorts .
a commonly used approach is to identify the phenotype - associated recurrent mutations in the study group . due to the data size burden of ngs output , profiling the mutations associated with a certain phenotype or prognosis in a study group by a researcher who does not have a bioinformatics background or facilities
recently , a number of mutation calling tools , such as varscan , genome analysis toolkit , and mutect , have been developed to detect single - nucleotide variants ( snvs ) or indels from ngs data . however , snv calling from a single cancer case is not the final step for defining clinically meaningful mutations . to define the pathogenic snvs in human cancers ,
