in terms of the differences in the muscle activity for each posture , the four muscles 
 measured ( right splenius capitis , right upper trapezius , left splenius capitis , left upper 
 trapezius ) did not show any statistically significant differences ( table 3table 3.comparison of the muscle activity under the posturesmuscleposturemeanstandard deviationright splenius capitisneutral posture14.27.4middle bending posture13.48.2maximum bending posture 18.825.9right upper trapeziusneutral posture8.95.8middle bending posture5.53.9maximum bending posture 7.15.7left splenius capitisneutral posture14.29.9middle bending posture13.111.0maximum bending posture 13.711.0left upper trapeziusneutral posture7.74.4middle bending posture5.63.9maximum bending posture7.91.2 ) .
however , there 
 was no change in muscle activity because of the experimenter s tension by the awareness of 
 experiments was not controlled and the realization of real long - time smart phone use was 
 limited by measuring emg signal for short smart phone using time of five minutes21,22,23.this result is consistent with that of 
 jung s study , in which during the head - neck bending exercise of the cervical lordosis group , 
 kyphosis group , and hyperlordosis group , a comparative analysis was performed on the 
 activity of the deep flexor and the sternocleidomastoid using pressure and ultrasonic 
 images , and a higher level of pressure led to a corresponding increase in the activity of 
 the deep cervical flexor24 .
