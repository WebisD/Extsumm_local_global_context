the aim of the present study was to compare the clinical and microbiological effects 
 of scaling and root planing with hand instruments to a non - surgical treatment with 
 the use of an ultrasonic device combined with the application of locally delivered 
 doxycycline .
was observed 
 between 3 and 6 months in the experimental group , which however was not strong 
 enough to provide a statistically significant difference between the two groups . in 
 conclusion , it is suggested that more long - term studies focusing on the outcome of 
 the combined therapy during supportive periodontal treatment are needed , where more 
 favourable results could be expected , especially in the case of deep pockets .
the patients fulfilling the necessary prerequisites were assigned into 2 groups of 20 
 patients each : control group ( scaling and root planing with hand instruments - srp ) 
 and experimental group ( ultrasonic debridement + doxycycline - ud + doxy ) .
the 
 difference between the responses to scaling alone and scaling combined with 
 tetracycline fibers were small and not statistically significant . in a systematic 
 review
according to the findings of present study the adjunctive use of locally delivered 
 doxycycline did not seem to add any beneficial effect to the active treatment of 
 chronic periodontitis . only in deep pockets an additional improvement
