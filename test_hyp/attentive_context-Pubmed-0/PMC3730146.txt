unlike the previous study , a decrease point in wai score started in early age that may be due to life - style work and another psychological factor ; on the other hand , nasa - tlx revealed high score in six subscales that can be another reason for low wai .
the result of one - way analysis of anova shown between wai and nasa - tlx in job groups was statistically significant ( p = 0.01 ) .
anova test revealed that relationships between work shifts and wai were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , and these relationships were not significant with mental workload ( p > 0.05 ) .
the result indicated that nasa - tlx score was more affected by working conditions in contrast to individual factors such as age and bmi .
relationships between bmi with wai and mental workload were not statistically significant ( multiple multivariate regression test , p > 0.05 ) .
a second aim was to identify factors that affected mental workload and work ability index in textile workers .
multiple multivariate regression test showed that relationships between age and wai were statistically significant ( p = 0.007 ) , but these relationships were not statistically significant with mental workload ( p > 0.05 ) .
