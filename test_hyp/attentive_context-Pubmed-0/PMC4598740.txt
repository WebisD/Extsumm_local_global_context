indeed , the rapid spread of wallaby and cheesyter into many species of the dairy environment , even when occurring only as contaminants , indicates that transgenes may readily cross species boundaries in the food chain . finally , the findings here of rapid adaptation through frequent horizontal gene transfers among distant species under selection in novel , human - made media contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary genomic mechanisms allowing rapid adaptation to environmental changes in eukaryotes .
we used this rooted phylogeny to investigate the occurrence of horizontal gene transfers ( hgts ) between penicillium species .
we report here five newly sequenced and assembled penicillium genomes , which we compared with previously available data   .
furthermore , we provide experimental evidence of fitness advantages for strains carrying these htrs on a human - made medium . these findings altogether are potentially useful for guiding modern strain improvement programs . indeed , together with the protocol for inducing sex in p.  roqueforti   , the identification here of several key candidate genes important for cheese metabolism and competition may allow further selecting interesting traits for cheese industry using the great genetic variability present in p.  roqueforti strains without wallaby or cheesyter .
