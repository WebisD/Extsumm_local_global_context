the present study attempts to correlate some anthropometric variables with lipid parameters in apparently healthy subjects , as also to assess the anthropometric variable which best reflects the altered lipid profile .
furthermore , the correlation of bmi with lipid parameters in the bmi < 25 group was weak and insignificant ; in the bmi 25 group bmi showed a significantly negative correlation with hdl ( r = 0.3 , p = 0.03 ) .
not all studied anthropometric variables correlate with the lipid status of the body , but wc remains one of the simple and reliable variables which best reflects the lipid profile . in a developing country like india , where measurement of cardiovascular risk factors such as body fat saturation and lipid profile remains difficult in the rural population , wc may be used as an effective tool , without being used as a substitute .
thus , both genders , especially in older age group , may be at equal risk of developing dyslipidemia .
comparison of anthropometric and lipid variables between the younger and the older age groups table 5 makes a comparison of anthropometric and lipid variables between the genders of younger and older age groups chosen . in the younger age group , the mean values of lipid and anthropometric variables were generally higher for the males than the females ; mean values of tc , tg and ldl were significantly higher .
