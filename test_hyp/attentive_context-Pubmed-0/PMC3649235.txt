we report a case of predominantly external jugular vein ( ejv ) involvement in an adolescent male with negative blood culture results .
a twelve year old boy presented to the children s assessment unit with a 24 hour history of unilateral face and neck swelling on a background of seven days progressive sore throat and dysphagia .
postanginal septicaemia in the early 20 century ; originally associated with a mortality reaching 90% it involves a classic triad of oropahryngeal sepsis , internal jugular vein ( ijv ) thrombophlebitis and metastatic abscess formation ( 1 ) . 
a recent history of a sore throat in conjunction with sepsis and or a suggestive and often declining clinical picture should always prompt early antibiotic therapy whilst a diagnosis of ls is sought ; hopefully preventing the development of late embolic complications .
a provisional diagnosis of tonsillitis had been made five days earlier by the local gp and a course of erythromycin and penicillinv commenced .
clinical findings can therefore vary considerably from neck pain and swelling associated with thrombophlebitis to pleuritic chest pain , haemoptysis , dyspnoea or arthralgia as a result of septic thromboemboli .
despite ijv thrombophlebitis forming a main diagnostic criterion for ls , we report a case in which the primary vascular involvement is that of the ejv , with a corresponding normal ijv .
