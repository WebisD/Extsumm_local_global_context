, we have shown that both microalbuminuria and c - ad are independently associated with cardiovascular mortality in an elderly , caucasian population of individuals with normal glucose metabolism , igm , and diabetes .
in this prospective study we found that both microalbuminuria and c - ad ( estimated from the mean of 10 standardized tests ) were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality in a cohort of elderly , caucasian subjects with and without diabetes . therefore , c
association between microalbuminuria and c - ad * model 1 : univariate analysis ; model 2 : adjusted for sex , age , and gts ; model 3 : model 2 plus adjustments for hypertension , whr , estimated glomerular filtration rate , ldl , hdl , triglycerides , smoking , and prior cvd .
therefore , it may be useful to treat not only microalbuminuria but also c - ad in populations at high risk of cardiovascular mortality .
these associations were attenuated after adjustment for age , sex , and glucose tolerance status ( gts ) ( 2.23   and 1.81   , respectively ; model 2 ) . further adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors only slightly further attenuated these rrs ( model 3 ) , and when the c - ad total score or microalbuminuria was added to these models , the rr attributable to microalbuminuria remained practically unchanged and both microalbuminuria ( 2.13   ) and c - ad total score ( 1.76   ) were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality ( model 4 ) .
