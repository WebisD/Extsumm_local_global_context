here , we describe a 63-year - old korean woman who presented with non - traumatic spontaneous diaphyseal fractures of both femurs and delayed fracture healing after 5 years bisphosphonate therapy .
furthermore , considering some definitive case reports , we must emphasize the need for awareness of recent controversies about the effect of long - term reduction of bone turnover on bone strength , especially the occurrence of awkward fractures at an unexpected site , as in this patient .
schneider   also described a 59-year - old previously healthy woman who experienced two non - traumatic stress fractures of the femur , 4 years apart , while on alendronate therapy .
the benefits of prolonged use of bisphosphonates must be carefully weighed against the potential adverse effects of over - suppression of bone metabolism .
bisphosphonates are have been used for many years for a variety of conditions including paget 's disease , osteoporosis , multiple myeloma , and hypercalcemia of malignancy .
have reported on nine patients who sustained spontaneous non - spinal fractures while on alendronate therapy .
although bisphosphonates are generally safe and effective , concerns have been raised about the potential risk of over - suppression of bone turnover during long - term use .
