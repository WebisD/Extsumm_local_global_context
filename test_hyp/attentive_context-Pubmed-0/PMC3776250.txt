for the first time measurements of the force - extension dependence of single strands of ds - dna with systematically varying length are carried out .
experiments with optical tweezers on the elastic properties of dna are mainly restricted to -phage dna which has a contour length of 16  m . in the presented article ,
this enables one to analyze in great detail the elastic properties of dna and to check how well it can be described by the worm - like chain model   or competing approaches .
this enables one to exert and to control forces acting on a small object in the range between 10 to 100  pn with an extraordinary high resolution of 50  fn . by incorporating additional optical systems to determine the position of a microscopic particle in 3d - space with nanometer precision , the novel experimental tool of optical tweezers was invented
it became , for instance , possible to measure the elastic properties of -phage dna   on a single chain level , the rna polymerase was monitored for a single enzyme in action , or the work which has to be done to package bacteriophage dna into a single viral capsule was measured . in colloid physics , microscopic measurements of the pair interaction potential of two charge - stabilized colloids became possible   or direct determination of the cross correlations between two particles in an external potential .
