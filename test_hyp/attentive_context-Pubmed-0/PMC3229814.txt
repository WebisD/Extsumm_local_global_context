also , no significant difference was observed between the high- and low catechin groups with respect to changes in any cvd risk factors .
p - values with chi - squared test for female ratio and for biochemical parameters , anthropometric parameters , nutrient intake , and energy expenditure , with student 's t - test .
this rct showed that increase in serum adiponectin level in the high catechin group was greater than that in the low catechin group , although the net change between groups was not significant .
change in serum adiponectin and cardiovascular risk factors of participants according to high - catechin group and low - catechin group the change in high - catechin group minus the change in low - catechin group .
we found no significant difference between the high- and low catechin group with respect to changes in the serum adiponectin level : 0.35 g / ml ( 95% ci : 1.03 , 1.74 ) .
after 9 weeks of catechin consumption , the meansd changes from baseline in the adiponectin level were significantly increased in both groups . however , we found no significant difference between the high- and low catechin group with respect to changes in the serum adiponectin level : 0.35 g / ml ( 95% ci : 1.03 , 1.74 ) .
