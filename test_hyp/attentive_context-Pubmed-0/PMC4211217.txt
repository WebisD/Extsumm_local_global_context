hence , we examined the preoperative plasma level of opn and the opn expression by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) in the paraffin - embedded tumor tissues by incisional biopsy of the same patients and evaluated the prognostic significance of opn expression in oscc patients .
the control group comprised of ten ( n = 10 ) ; age and sex matched volunteers from whom , in the form of biopsies , normal mucosae and blood samples for plasma were collected .
opn expression also significantly correlated with more aggressive tumor behavior in the cohort of oscc patients . in conclusion , high expression level of opn in either the tumor or the plasma of the oscc patients is associated with tumor progression .
in the present study , an effort was made to evaluate the efficacy of plasma opn and tissue opn expressions , as a prognostic marker in 60 cases of oscc with different histological grading and 10 cases of ne .
