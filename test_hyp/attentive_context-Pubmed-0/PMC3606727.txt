the cell - based assay developed here has the potential to be a rapid screening method to confirm the presence of functional botulinum toxin types a and e. the fret - based reporter approach could be adapted to screen other bont serotypes with unique cleavage sites by using synthetic substrates labeled with different dyes .
the resulting reporters are stably expressed in living cells , and the neurotoxin cleavage activity is detected either by measuring the loss of fret or by destruction of the c - terminal fragment .
the main objective of our study was to develop a cell - based assay for the detection of bont / a and bont / e , which could be automated and applied to many laboratory settings . here , we report a cellular sensor utilizing advanced fret - based substrates expressed as fusions of green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) and discosoma sp .
further refinement of such assay will present an alternative to the mouse assay , and the ease of use could generate the confidence in field or reference laboratories capable of performing bont detection , leading to reduction in animal use .
these fret - based reporters are currently being evaluated for the analysis of different food matrices and also exploring new immuno - magnetic bead separation methods to counter the food matrix interference and to increase the sensitivity of the detection . even though the assay is thousandfold less sensitive than the mouse bioassay
