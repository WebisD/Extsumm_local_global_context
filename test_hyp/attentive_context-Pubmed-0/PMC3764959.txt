multidisciplinary management , clinical experience and high - resolution imaging support are crucial for determining tumor identification , primary tumor localization , and the extent of tumor involvement .
renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) comprises 23% of all adult malignancies and 85% of malignant renal tumors .
metastases of malignances in the head and neck are rare . when present , they tend to be very aggressive due to the advance stage of the disease .
it is the third most frequent neoplasm to metastasize to the head and neck region , preceded only by breast and lung cancer   .
we report on a 62-year - old male who presented to the ophthalmology service with vi cranial nerve bilateral paresis , absence of pharyngeal reflex , dysarthria , right tongue deviation , and paralysis to the right side of the face .
although infrequently reported , head and neck regional metastases may be linked to rcc in up to 815% of cases   .
the prognosis for patients with multiple rcc metastases is poor , with a 5-year survival rate of 07%   .
radiotherapy was recommended , but due to the advanced stage of the disease the patient was enrolled in a palliative care and pain control program .
