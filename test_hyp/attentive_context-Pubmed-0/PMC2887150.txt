thus , at this time , it is difficult to recommend anesthetics for the purpose of neuroprotection in cardiac arrest .
therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to provide neuroprotection against ischemic injury after cardiac arrest in in vitro and in vivo models . in the previous issue of critical care , meybohm and
cardiac arrest remains the leading cause of death in the us and europe , with an out - of - hospital cardiac arrest survival - to - discharge rate of less than 10% . in - hospital cardiac arrest presents a dismal prognosis . according to a large in - hospital registry , the survival - to - discharge rate is 18% , whereas that of a developing country is 6.9% . without prompt care
colleagues   demonstrate that cardiac arrest triggers the release of cerebral inflammatory cytokines in pigs ' cerebral cortex .
thus , improving survival and brain function after initial resuscitation from cardiac arrest remains a critical challenge .
it is even possible that in the setting of clinical practice , anesthetics may not provide significant neuroprotection beyond that which is already being produced by therapeutic hypothermia .
however , physician use of hypothermia induction in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest is low . in 2003 ,
