in this study , visual acuity in the majority of eyes that initially presented with submacular hemorrhage had improved or remained relatively stable between six months after diagnosis and the final visit ( mean , 32.1 months ) . as a result ,
bcva at six months was found to be a useful clinical index predictive of long - term visual prognosis .
, relatively stable long - term visual outcome can be achieved for the majority of eyes exhibiting submacular hemorrhage as a secondary symptom to exudative amd when treated with intravitreal anti - vegf monotherapy , despite recurrence of exudation and/or submacular hemorrhage .
was significantly improved for both the typical exudative amd ( p = 0.031 ) and pcv ( p = 0.001 ) groups . for the pcv group ,
the mean number of injections after 12 months was far less than that administered during the 12- to 24-month period in prior controlled clinical trials , despite our use of a longer time interval between the 12-month follow - up point and the final visit ( 20.1 months ) .
none of the differences in baseline bcva , hemorrhage extent , and central foveal thickness between the two groups were significant ( p = 0.744 , p = 0.827 , and p = 0.909 , respectively ) .
