taken together , our results suggest that wasp and wip work as a functional unit in a cellular context as has been previously proposed   to regulate podosome formation and dynamics during the establishment of cell polarity as seen in the chemotactic response to extracellular stimuli . in summary , we have shown that in dcs wip is essential for podosome formation and cell polarity by preventing the extensive degradation of wasp by calpain and by facilitating the recruitment of wasp to discrete foci to form the core of podosomes .
the tight coupling between wasp and wip is therefore a key contributor to normal podosome dynamics and likely of major importance to the cell trafficking behavior of dcs .
our data suggest that the key role of wip in podosome formation is in the organization of f - actin and the clustering of integrins and associated proteins .
wip has also been detected in the core of podosomes in endothelial cells expressing egfp - wip , and although there is evidence indicating that wip plays a major role in regulating the activity of wasp family proteins and the dynamics of actin filaments   , it remains unknown how wip participates in the assembly of podosomes .
