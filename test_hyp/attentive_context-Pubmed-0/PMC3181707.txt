we have demonstrated that , melatonin is a bioprecursor of hypnotic acetyl metabolites produced by enzymatic acetylation of melatonin and 2-oxomelatonin under the control of acetyltransferases , most probably the nat enzymes . in 1994 , in our laboratory , we developed a specific and highly sensitive gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) method to assay , simultaneously and distinct ! ) , plasma concentrations of endogenous melatonin ( d0melatonin ) and exogenous melatonin ( d7-melatonin ) , in which 7 atoms of h have been substituted by 7 atoms of deuterium .
we have evidenced the role played by melatonin in both inducing and maintaining nocturnal sleep .
since insomnia and sleep disorders may be due to a lack of nat enzymes in the pineal gland , a therapeutic approach to sleep disorders could be suggested .
there is a large interindividual variability in the amount , of melatonin released in plasma by the pineal gland during the night in young and old subjects alike .
using the same human volunteers ( 12 young subjects in june 1994 and 12 elderly subjects in october 1994 ) , we determined the pharmacokinetics of exogenous d7-melatonin , when given orally and intravenously , and the kinetics of the pineal secretion of endogenous d0-melatonin . ,   the results shown in figure 2 led to the following conclusions : secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland occurs only during the night .
