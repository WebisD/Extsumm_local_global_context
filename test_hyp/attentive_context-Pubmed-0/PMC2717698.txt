image - guided radiotherapy ( igrt ) is a novel array of techniques to help minimize the discrepancies due to variations in patient / tumor position .  
with the advent of highly precise conformal therapies , such as imrt , the accurate localization and delivery of radiotherapy will be increasingly important in the decades to come .
although many of these sophisticated imaging and treatment modalities that employ igrt are still yet to be proven beneficial in randomized controlled trials , the theoretical benefits of improved disease - control and normal tissue sparing are currently being demonstrated in a variety of peer - reviewed publications , which is the focus of the following review .
recent advances in image - guided radiotherapy provide increased tumor localization by improving the identification of areas of tumor burden , by minimizing the effects of patient setup errors caused by intra-/interfraction motion , and by allowing for adaptive replanning to changes that occur in the tumor or patient during long courses of radiotherapy . in doing so
however , igrt can also be divided into three broad categories of image - based innovations : ( 1 ) the integration of functional and biological imaging into the treatment planning process to improve tumor contouring ( or target delineation ) , ( 2 ) the use of various imaging modalities to adjust for tumor motion and positional uncertainty , and finally ( 3 ) the adaptation of treatment planning based on tumor response and changes in normal tissue anatomy .
