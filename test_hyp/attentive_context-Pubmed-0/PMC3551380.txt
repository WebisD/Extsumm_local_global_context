comparison of bladder dose by conventional and ct planning mean icru point doses and d2cc volume doses in bladder and rectum in our study ( semi orthogonal method ) icru  international commission on radiation units and measurements ; d2cc  dose received by 2cc of the volume of the bladder calculated from image based ct planning ; ci  confidence interval the mean d2cc of the rectum obtained from the 3d plan was 4.2gy ( 2.8 - 5.9 gy ) .
comparison of rectal dose by conventional and ct planning mean icru point doses and d2cc volume doses in bladder and rectum ( orthogonal method ) icru  international commission on radiation units and measurements ; d2cc  dose received by 2cc of the volume of the bladder calculated from image based ct planning biologically normalized total dose eqd2 for bladder and rectum ( / = 3 ) in our study
the mean contoured volume of bladder and rectum was 104 (  64 ) cc and 48 (  13 ) cc , respectively .
the mean icru bladder dose obtained for our patients was 3.08 gy ( 1.9 - 5.9 gy ) .
when we compared our results for the mean icru point doses obtained using semi orthogonal approach and the d2cc doses for rectum and bladder on ct scans , we found that the average ratio of icru rectal dose to d2cc ( rectum ) by our approach was 1.10 which is similar to the ratios obtained such as 1.66 , 1.11 and 1.07 by other authors   for rectum , respectively .
