even though the epidermoid cyst of the kidney is a very rare to be characterized , the typical features of the lesion can be summarized as follows .
this case of a noncalcified epidermoid cyst in the renal pelvis is the first report in the english literature .
a 73-year - old female was admitted for surgical removal of a left renal pelvic mass . she has taken antihypertensive agents for 30 years and received percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina 3 years ago . during routine follow - up , a renal mass was incidentally detected 2 months ago .
, it seemed hard to think of epidermoid cyst as a presumptive diagnosis before surgery in this case . to the best of our knowledge ,
however , some squamous epithelia contained a few uroplakin - positive cells and ck7-positive cells to some extent . even though the significance of few uroplakin expressions in squmous epithelium should be evaluated by other studies , is this an indirect evidence of the direct transformation of umbrella cells to squamous metaplasia or dedifferenctiation of metaplastic squamous epithelium to urothelium ?
to date , two cases of epidermoid cyst in the renal pelvis have been reported .
