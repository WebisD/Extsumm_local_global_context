furthermore , the aim of this study was to shed light on the link between the activation of young children s motor system during action observation and their joint action performance . in order to investigate young children s motor involvement in joint action
the present study is one of the first to explore the role of the motor system in young children s involvement in a naturalistic joint action .
to determine modulations in the child s motor system activation , we compared children s brain response during their partner s actions in the two conditions . finally , we correlated the outcome of the eeg analysis with children s joint action performance to examine the relation between their motor system involvement for the partner s actions and their own action performance .
the current findings of enhanced motor activation for observing the own partner s actions as well as the correlation between motor system involvement and children s joint action performance might reflect children s predictive processing .
furthermore , the results show that the stronger the time - locked effect in beta - power , the fewer errors children made when acting jointly . this study is one of the first to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying joint action in young children .
