cns disease in np - sle may share common mechanisms with peripheral organ pathology in sle , especially in the latter stages of the disease , but the distinct nature of cns - mediated immunity and the blood - brain barrier indicates that early manifestations of particularly mood disorders may be derived from some unique mechanisms .
additionally , agents critical to the pathology of np - sle , such as cytokines , are regulated by sex and steroid hormones , which is consistent with the predominance of sle and mood disorders in females . altered cytokine profiles in serum and/or cns can result in the activation of astrocytes , microglia , and changes in neuronal function and morphology and dysregulation of the blood - brain barrier
these include relating measures of the earliest onset of negative behavioral outcomes with intrathecal levels of cytokines and native brain - reactive autoantibodies , systematic study of the efficacy of alternative therapeutics ( such as traditional and novel antidepressants ) , and comprehensive analysis of the time course of blood - brain barrier dysfunction .
systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is an autoimmune disease that is typified by multiple abnormalities of the immune system , and which results in widespread pathology of multiple organs , including skin , kidney , heart , lungs , and joints .
