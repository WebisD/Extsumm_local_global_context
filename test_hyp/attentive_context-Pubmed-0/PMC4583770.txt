the current study aimed to determine the correlation between serum ferritin and hepcidin levels in patients with tm and ti , also compare serum hepcidin and ferritin levels between the two groups of patients .
increased awareness of hepcidin levels in the patients with thalassemia could be helpful to diagnose and manage iron burden in such patients .
considering the cut - off point of 54.4 ng / ml for serum hepcidin levels , 44 ( 91.7% ) , and 18 ( 45% ) subjects had hepcidin levels higher than normal range in the tm and ti groups , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .  
, there was insignificant correlation between serum hepcidin and ferritin levels as a marker of iron overload in any of the two groups of patients with tm and ti , which supported the results of previous studies that regulation of hepcidin in patients with thalassemia is more affected by erythropoeitic activity than by iron overload .
, it is believed that low dose hu ( 10 - 15 mg / kg / day ) therapy for a long time could increase hb levels and lead to transfusion - independence , but probably not high enough to suppress bone marrow activity and make erythropoiesisin effective .
