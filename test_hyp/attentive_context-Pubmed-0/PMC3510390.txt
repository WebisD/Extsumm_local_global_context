the advantages of mixing lidocaine with pcl dermal filler before treatment are lower viscosity and elasticity , lower extrusion force , providing a greater ease of molding , increased patient comfort , reduced need for nerve blocks and infiltration anesthesia , which may be attractive for both physicians and patients .
a range of lidocaine and lidocaine with epinephrine concentrations was mixed with the plc dermal filler to evaluate the changes in dynamic viscosity and elasticity , extrusion force , ph , and needle jam rates .
hand mixing lidocaine or lidocaine with epinephrine with the pcl dermal filler causes no significant changes to the physical properties of the original formulation . with 15 back - and - forth
in this study the characterization of the physical properties of pcl dermal filler mixed with plain 2.0% lidocaine - hcl solutions and combined 2.0% lidocaine - hcl and epinephrine under various mixing condition is investigated .
the viscosity , elasticity , and the extrusion force of the dermal filler decrease with increasing lidocaine content .
( pre)clinical studies with lidocaine premixed before treatment and lidocaine incorporated in the pcl dermal filler syringe itself are aimed at confirming this .
the result of mixing the two components is that the treatment is less painful to the patient than the conventional hand injection , and is characterized by less swelling and bruising , with minimal posttreatment downtime . increasing numbers of physicians are adopting and using this technique for mixing the pcl dermal filler with standard 2.0% lidocaine - hydrochloride ( hcl ) solutions , up to 0.19  ml of lidocaine with a 1.1  ml syringe of pcl dermal filler . mixing 0.19  ml of 2.0% lidocaine solution with 1.1  ml of pcl dermal filler
