we present a case of an isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue in a 11-year - old girl not associated with neurofibromatosis .
we present this case for its rare site along with nonassociation with neurofibromatosis , excellent recovery , and no recurrence till date on follow - up .
plexiform neurofibroma is the term applied to a diffuse neurofibromatosis of nerve trunks , which is often associated with an overgrowth of the skin and subcutaneous tissues .
this systemic process , originally described by von recklinghausen , is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a defect on chromosome 17 .
plexiform neurofibromas are the least common variant and usually are pathognomonic for nf i. the most commonly involved sites are the temple , upper lid , back of the neck , and the tongue .
oral manifestations of neurofibromatosis have been reported in only 4 - 7% affected persons , in which the tongue was the most commonly involved site .
an 11-year - old girl was admitted to the department of e.n.t . of our institute , with the complaint of inability to close the mouth because of a large , asymmetrical , protruding tongue .
solitary plexiform neurofibromas arising outside the context of nf i , as illustrated in the patient presented here , are quite rare , with only scattered cases reported in the literature till date . in the literature , there are only few reports of macroglossia caused by plexiform neurofibroma , and the cases are almost always associated with neurofibromatosis .
