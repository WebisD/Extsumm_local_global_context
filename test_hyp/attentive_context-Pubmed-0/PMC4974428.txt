we describe a case of an unusual and severe course of nmo affecting almost the entire spinal cord and brain .
neuromyelitis optica ( nmo ) or devic 's disease is a rare inflammatory , demyelinating disease of the central nervous system ( cns ) that predominantly targets the optic nerves and spinal cord 1 . the disease was first described in 1870 by albutt and 24 years later , devic described the clinical characteristics of nmo 
the patient was referred to hospital with an acuteonset chest pain , which is an unusual first symptom of nmo .
the treatment in this particular case was targeted to multiple causes of the symptoms due to the unknown etiology in the beginning of the disease .
the next day , the patient reported headache and neurological examination showed rightsided hemiparesis and afferent pupillary defect of the left eye suggesting an afferent optic nerve defect . within a few hours , the patient showed a rapid neurological deterioration with progressive tetraplegia and global decline .
examination on the day of admission revealed normal results as regards ecg , troponin i , and computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest and abdomen .
