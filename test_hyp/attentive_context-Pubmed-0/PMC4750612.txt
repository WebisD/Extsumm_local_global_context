the purpose of this prospective study was to compare those two types of mru in terms of ureteral visualization in patients with non - dilated ureters , using diuretic administration by means of a direct confrontation of each technique in the same patient .
statistically , the interobserver agreement was excellent with a  correlation coefficient as high as 0.89 for t2w - mru and 0.92 for ce - mru , respectively .
each sequence was evaluated separately and independently by two radiologists ( phh , ga ) with five and three years of experience in abdominal mr imaging , respectively .
low - dose ( 520  mg ) intravenous furosemide administration has been recommended for excretory ce - mru to improve the visualization of the non - dilated upper urinary tract , . to the best of our knowledge
a total of 252 ureters were evaluated and 1008 segments were checked . for the assessment of image quality , readers judged both sequences good or excellent for all segments ( score 3 : 35/252 ; 51/252 ; score 4 : 217/252 ; 201/252 for t2w - mru and ce - mru , respectively ) .
one rotation of t2w - mru was found clearly inaccurate to assess the non - dilated ureter . increasing the number of rotations , significantly improved the visualization of all segments . with 9 rotations and
