the results of this study agreed with our hypotheses , indicating that threatening context challenged locomotion amongst people living with the parkinson disease and that obstacle crossing errors were increased , while obstacle crossing kinematics , specifically obstacle clearance distances and velocity , was decreased during threatened context trials .
the purpose of this study was to investigate changes in obstacle crossing behaviour amongst the meds on and meds off pd patients in response to task context .
pd patients exhibited more obstacle contacts , decreased obstacle crossing clearance margins , and decreased approach and crossing velocities when walking in a threatening condition .
we had patients step over a walking - surface obstacle in two contexts : at floor level and on a raised walking platform , previously identified as sufficient to threaten participants ' sensorimotor system , and elicit changes in motor strategy   .
in addition , motor improvements potentiated amongst pd patients through conventional pharmacotherapy were not uniformly maintained in the threatening context .
all pd patients were receiving dopaminergic and associated medication as pd management ( table 1 ) , and each pd subject was tested meds off ( > 12  h removed from last dose ) and meds on ( between 1  h and 2  h following regular dose ) in the same laboratory visit ( same day ) .
