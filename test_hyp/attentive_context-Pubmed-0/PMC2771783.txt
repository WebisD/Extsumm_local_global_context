1 ) . however , in peaf patients , compared with the group not using aceis or arbs , the recurrence rate was significantly decreased in the group using aceis or arbs ( 12.1% vs. 61.1% , p<0.01 ) ( fig .
in multivariate analysis , the use of aceis or arbs was independently associated with recurrence after adjusting for the left atrium dimension and the left ventricle ejection fraction ( or=0.078 , 95% ci=0.02 - 0.35 , p<0.01 ) .
in paf patients , no significant differences existed in the recurrence rates between the group with aceis or arbs and the group without aceis or arbs ( 24.2% vs. 22.9% , p=0.87 ) ( fig .
the left atrium dimension ( 44.28.4 mm vs. 44.35.8 mm , respectively , p=0.45 ) and the left ventricle ejection fraction ( 626.5% vs. 61.56.2% , respectively , p=0.28 ) were not significantly different .
aceis or arbs might be effective in preventing af recurrence after catheter ablation in peaf patients .
this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of aceis and arbs on the recurrence of af after rfca .
we retrospectively evaluated 152 patients ( mean age , 5710 years ; m : f=94 : 58 ) who underwent af ablation due to drug - refractory paroxysmal ( mean age , 5710 years ; m : f=58 : 43 ) or persistent af ( mean age , 5610 years ; m : f=36 : 15 ) . among the 152 patients ,
