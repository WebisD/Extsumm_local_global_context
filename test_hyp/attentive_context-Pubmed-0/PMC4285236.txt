our patient had job syndrome , a primary immunodeficiency not previously associated with polyomavirus susceptibility .
this case suggests that immunosuppression might also play a role in wupyv infection and expands our understanding of wupyv biology .
the presence of nuclease - resistant viral dna from the optiprep gradient and detection of wu - vp1 , which is believed to be expressed concomitantly with dna replication ( 12 ) , suggests that the cells were infected by wupyv and that the wupyv life cycle reached at least the stage of late gene expression .
before this study , to our knowledge , no specific cell type had been identified as susceptible to wupyv infection .
although we attempted to identify a second population of wu - vp1-positive , cytokeratin - negative cells , the etiologic features of these cells remains uncertain .
the clinical role of infection by wupyv is uncertain , given that the patient was not experiencing any recognizable symptoms .
it is possible that immunosuppressant medications , which include prednisone and tacrolimus , altered susceptibility to virus infection . other human polyomaviruses are believed to exclusively cause disease in immunocompromised hosts
