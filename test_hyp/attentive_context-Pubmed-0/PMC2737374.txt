one of the most significant challenges is the impact of horizontal gene transfer , which causes genes that coexist in a genome to have different molecular phylogenies . despite these challenges , the increasing ease with which genomes can be sequenced has reinvigorated attempts to use genomic information to reconstruct the tol .
the tree of life ( tol ) is a widely used metaphor to describe the history of life on earth . while darwin argued that the ' coral of life ' may be a more apt description ( since only the surface remains alive , supported by the dead generations beneath it ) , relationships between organisms based on shared characters are best organized using the schematic representation of a tree .
use of molecular markers , in particular small - subunit ribosomal rna , have allowed this metaphor to be extended to microorganisms ; however , this has also presented unique challenges for notions of phylogeny and evolution .
this result is significant in that it suggests that there is no need to postulate exotic ' big bang ' radiations early in evolution ; rather , deep phylogenies can still be represented as bifurcating evolutionary events , albeit with extremely short branches that can prove difficult ( or sometimes impossible ) to resolve . integrating the vertical descent of organisms and their genomes with the myriad phylogenetic patterns produced by horizontal gene transfer is essential for a truly comprehensive understanding of evolution .
