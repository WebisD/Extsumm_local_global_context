hence , the main goal of this research was to determine the effects of the metabolic syndrome on the periodontal indices of hd patients .
the results of this study revealed when the severity of chronic systemic disease increased the health of the periodontal tissues would decrease in such a manner that the hd patients suffering from metabolic syndrome showed the lowest level of health for the periodontal tissues , and the hd patients not suffering from metabolic syndrome and the control group showed the highest level of health , respectively .
in this descriptive - analytical study , 75 persons were selected by the simple method , 50 of them were hd patients ( for 5 years ) , and 25 of them were healthy people .
the first group included 25 hd patients not suffering from metabolic syndrome ; the second group included 25 hd patients suffering from metabolic syndrome and the third group , namely the control group of the study , included 25 healthy persons ( not affected by hd and metabolic syndrome ) .
hence , the patients suffering from both metabolic syndrome and hd showed the maximum value for probe depth and the control group , including the healthy persons showed the minimum value for the probe depth .
