in addition , many pathological and physiological processes occur concurrently , and separating the cause and effect of just one feature of the disease ( tissue hypoxia ) can prove extremely difficult .
hypoxic adaptive processes are likely to be common to tissue hypoxia whatever the cause , however , and studying healthy individuals progressively exposed to hypoxia through ascent to high altitude may inform of the nature of the hypoxic adaptive processes occurring in critically ill patients .
hypoxaemia in critical illness may be caused by hypo - ventilation , ventilation / perfusion mismatch , right - to - left shunting or limitation of diffusion across the alveolar  capillary membrane .
studying human responses to hypobaric hypoxia may offer important insights into the pathophysiology of critical illness .
finally , the approach also offers an ethical alternative to hypoxia experimentation in patients ; all individuals involved are willing participants in climbing or trekking ventures , as a consequence of which they expose themselves to a hypoxic environment .
this approach offers the advantages of a relatively homogeneous study population and environmental challenge , in contrast to those observed on critical care units , as well as the availability of ' premorbid ' information and levels of function .
