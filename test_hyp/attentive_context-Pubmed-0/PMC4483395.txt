therefore , performing symmetrical bilateral upper extremity exercises 
 which utilize treatment tools of different sizes and weights and movements involved in daily 
 living activities , can be used as an effective therapeutic intervention method in the 
 recovery of upper extremity functions and daily living in stroke patients .
this study was conducted to examine the effects of symmetric bilateral upper extremity 
 exercises applied with diverse functional training in comparison with repetitive bilateral 
 upper extremity exercises including acoustic signals on the recovery of upper extremity 
 functions and daily living activities in stroke patients . according to the results of this 
 study , both the tbg and rbg showed significant effects on the recovery of upper extremity 
 motor functions and daily living activities . after implementing the exercise programs , both 
 groups showed significant improvement in the bbt , jtt , and mbi scores . in a study conducted by lin et al.12 on 
 chronic stroke patients who had had the disease for at least 6 months , the group that 
 performed bilateral upper extremity exercises showed further improvement in spatial - temporal 
 control of the affected upper extremity and fugel - meyer assessment scores than the control 
 group . in a study conducted by cauraugh et al.9 ,
