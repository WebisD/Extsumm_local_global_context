hcv - related graft complications are associated with a significant reduction in patient survival and is the leading cause of liver failure in many transplant centres .
hcv infection is a major concern for human health with an estimated 3% of the world 's population infected .
. further advances in the development of in vitro and ex vivo models for the study of hcv infection in a manner that closely mimics the liver are greatly anticipated , especially to evaluate the efficacy of promising new direct acting antiviral treatments and host - targeted agents currently in the pipe line .
have become available and with these coevolved novel permissive in vitro platforms to enable investigation of infection , transmission , and therapeutic interventions .
more recently , two ns3 protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir have been licensed for hcv treatment   ; however , there are reports of virus resistance to both inhibitors . in cases of hcv - associated liver failure ,
transplant is the only therapy , making hcv a leading indicator for liver transplantation in the developed world .
the restricted tropism of hcv and lack of small animal models have necessitated the development of in vitro model systems for the study of the full virus cycle . since the virus was first cloned over 20 years ago , in vitro replicating clones
