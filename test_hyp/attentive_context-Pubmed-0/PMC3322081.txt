an increase of listeriosis was noted since 2005 in our hospital , and all of the affected patients had predisposing factors that hampered their immunity .
we observed an upsurge of listeriosis beginning in 2005 in ntuh . the increase might not be attributable to common - source outbreaks because no clustering was detected .
we found that mortality was related to hepatic decompensation and effective antimicrobial drug therapy after culture results were reported .
food monitoring and human disease surveillance systems need to be established in taiwan to control this potentially fatal foodborne disease .
the contributions of disease severity and antimicrobial drug treatment are difficult to evaluate in population - based studies ( 12 ) .
patient distribution and incidence of human listeriosis , by age group , national taiwan university hospital , taipei , taiwan , 19962008 .
initial disease severity and initial adequate antimicrobial drug therapy was not associated with overall mortality .
the retrospective design of our study limited the possibility of identifying the potential vehicles and disease - acquiring behaviors .
brouwer et al . reported that up to 30% of adults with l. monocytogenes meningitis did not receive initial adequate antimicrobial drug therapy , and they found no association between that variable and outcome ( 13 ) . a high proportion ( 37% ) of patients in our study
