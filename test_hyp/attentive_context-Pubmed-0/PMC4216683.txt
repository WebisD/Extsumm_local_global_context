therefore , we compared the entire genomes of three different rabbit - passaged attenuated zb strains ( zb / cha/58(att ) , zbrf168 , and zbrf188 ) and their virulent parental viruses ( zbcf22 and ynbs/58 ) , in order to identify genomic changes that occurred during the attenuation process of the zb strain .
the genome sequences of the virulent zbcf22 and the rabbit - attenuated strains ( zbrf168 and zbrf188 ) were determined to be 8,164 nucleotides ( nt ) in length ( excluding the poly - c and poly - a tracts ) and contain an orf of 6,990  nt that encodes a polyprotein of 2,329 amino acids , which is consistent with the previously reported zb / cha/58(att ) genome .
however , determining which and how those amino acid substitutions are directly involved in the attenuation of the virulent viruses will require animal experiments and cell infections to determine the pathogenesis of different mutated viruses .
in conclusion , we identified genomic changes between the virulent and attenuated fmdv zb strains in the untranslated regions , as well as in the protein coding regions , and discussed those changes correlated with the virus attenuation in context of the current knowledge of the fmdv 's molecular biology .
