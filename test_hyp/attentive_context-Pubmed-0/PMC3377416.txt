from the first reported infected patient in may 2009 through january 2010 , a total of 740,835 patients in south korea were reported as having pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 virus infection .
thus , we can not report the prevalence of drug - resistant pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 and risk factors for drug - resistant virus infection in south korea .
our nationwide surveillance of drug - resistant pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 in south korea indicated that most patients were children ( < 59 months of age ) or immunocompromised .
further studies are needed to monitor oseltamivir resistance , especially in immunosuppressed or pediatric patients when treatment failure with oseltamivir or prolonged viral shedding occur .
a recent study in australia reported that 4 of 32 adult oncology and hematology patients were infected with oseltamivir - resistant virus with the h275y mutation ( 5 ) . in 3 of our patients ( patients 3 , 5 , and 11 ) drug - resistant
our finding that oseltamivir resistance developed in immunocompromised patients is consistent with those of recent case reports that described development of oseltamivir resistance in immunosuppressed patients receiving this drug ( 3,4 ) .
