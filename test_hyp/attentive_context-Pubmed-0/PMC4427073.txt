we report a 32-year - old iranian male diagnosed with a case of miliary tuberculosis affecting the prostate .
computerized tomography increased the clinical suspicion of miliary tuberculosis extending to the prostate where a trans - rectal urethral biopsy was obtained .
a strong clinical suspicion and availability of sophisticated tests with confirmation by biopsy , polymerase chain reaction , and culture are needed in order to avoid misdiagnosis of complicated miliary tuberculosis cases .
here we report a case of a young , previously healthy , immunocompetent patient with miliary tuberculosis involving the prostate .
miliary tuberculosis is a rare form of a tuberculosis infection that results from massive lymphohematogenous dissemination of the mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli.1 this form of infection , which accounts for 2.8% of all tuberculosis infections , usually involves the extrapulmonary organs.2 from extrapulmonary tuberculosis only 22% affects the genitourinary system , while tuberculosis of the prostate gland is seen in only 2.7% of genitourinary tuberculosis.3,4 due to the rare involvement of the prostate , very scarce literature of the subject , and non - specific symptoms , the clinical suspicion of prostate tuberculosis is difficult .
we present a case of a 32-year - old immunocompetent iranian male who presented to the emergency room with a generalized tonic - clonic seizure lasting for 3 minutes .
