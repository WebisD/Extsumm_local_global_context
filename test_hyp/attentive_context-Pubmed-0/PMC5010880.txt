this cross - sectional study was conducted from april to october 2015 . to obtain a representative sample of athletes with shoulder injuries
there may be a role for shoulder - specific proprioceptive and strength training protocols for shoulder injuries in individuals with generalized ligamentous laxity who participate in high - risk sports , especially contact sports .
finally , we compared the history of acute and chronic instability between the two groups based on dislocation documentation or a history of shoulder pain with at least two positive clinical tests for instability ( table 7 ) .
this study highlights the importance of having screening programs in athletic clinics , sports clubs , and sports offices at high schools and universities to identify individuals with generalized ligamentous laxity , and emphasizes the need for physicians and surgeons to practice prophylactic measures .
they were divided into two groups according to the beighton score : group a ( with ligamentous laxity ) consisted of 43 participants and group b ( without ligamentous laxity ) consisted of 75 participants .
thirteen participants in group a ( 30.2% ) and 11 participants in group b ( 14.6% ) had chronic shoulder injuries , which was statistically significant ( p = 0.032 ) .
