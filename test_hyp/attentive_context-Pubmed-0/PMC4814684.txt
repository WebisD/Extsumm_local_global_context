this review focuses primarily on nmdar and metabotropic glutamate receptor- ( mglur- ) mediated signaling . in particular , we highlight several mechanisms that underlie synaptic ltd as common signaling pathways that are hijacked by the neurotoxic effects of a. several pharmacological agents that target these pathways and are efficacious in inhibiting or reversing the neurotoxic effects of a on glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity are also discussed .
alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common cause of dementia among the aging population .
strong evidence from human genetics and transgenic mouse models has implicated a in the etiology and pathogenesis of ad .
it is likely that these receptors act cooperatively to mediate the synaptotoxic effects of a , highlighting the need for further investigation of the associated signaling mechanisms with a view to developing more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ad .
many human mutations associated with familial ad , such as those that are found in genes encoding app and the catalytic subunit of -secretase , presenilin ( ps1 and ps2 ) , promote amyloidogenic processing of app , leading to enhanced a production .
increasing evidence indicates that the trafficking of ampars , which is essential to multiple forms of synaptic and structural plasticity in the brain , is aberrantly dysregulated by oligomeric a and manifests as impairments in ltp , learning , and memory .
