furthermore , multicountry analysis is needed to understand continental spatial and temporal patterns of dispersion of zika virus and co - circulating viruses , such as chikungunya virus .
the arrival and rapid spread of zika virus in the americas resembles that of chikungunya virus , which was introduced into saint martin in the caribbean in 2013 ( 13,14 ) . increased knowledge of the speed of spread and direction of zika spread can help in understanding its possible future directions and pace at which it travels , which would be essential for targeted mosquito control interventions , public health messages , and travel advisories .
future work will investigate underlying causes for the southward and westward spread in brazil by incorporating mobility data and seasonal events , such as movement of persons between northeastern and southeastern regions for vacations , which could have driven the spatial transmission pattern .
symptom onset date is subject to error because it is based on self - report , and earlier introductions of zika in some municipalities might not have been captured by the ministry of health surveillance system and supplementary data sources , given the mild and generic nature of zika symptoms and the high proportion of asymptomatic persons ( 3 ) .
