following european guideline lipid goals , 66% in the very high - risk group reached target levels for overall cholesterol and 54% for ldl cholesterol .
compliance with statin treatment was rated high in denmark in the 1990s,5 but others have raised concerns regarding persistence of use , with reports of a large number of dropouts in short - term studies.6 while clinical studies often focus on middle- and low - risk populations , population - based studies may focus on real - life data , including high - risk populations.710 clinical trials have demonstrated that the most widely prescribed statins ( ie , simvastatin , atorvastatin , rosuvastatin , and pravastatin ) for both primary and secondary prevention purposes reduce total plasma cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol ; reductions of 0.52.26
for example , the proportion of simvastatin users who started with 40 mg tablets increased from 40% in 2004 to 75% in 2010 , and the proportion of rosuvastatin users who started with high doses ( 20 mg or 40 mg ) increased from 12% in 2004 to 21% in 2010 .
in addition , we aim to examine changes in lipid values over time after statin initiation and determined the percentage of patients attaining treatment goals for cholesterol levels , stratified by risk groups , and whether statin type was switched .
