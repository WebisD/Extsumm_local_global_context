this review ( surveyed database , 20132015 ) is complementary to the researchers for optimizing the lead chalcone as potential anticancer scaffold with increased potency .
chalcone architecture linked with various substitutions , such as methoxy , amino , and hydroxyl , and alteration of both rings has been found to be effective in making it a potential candidate in the anticancer armamentarium .
the related studies showed excellent cytotoxic activities of chalcones in the different cell death pathways , not just acting in blocking the process of cell division .
cancer , which is commonly a harbinger of imminent patient death , is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells and aberrant cell behavior , which leads to expansive masses that destroy surrounding normal tissue and is able to attack vital organs resulting in disseminated disease .
inhibitory concentrations in nanomolar range were impressive to show its ability to arrest cell division .
chalcone derivatives of diverse chemical architectures are quite significant in anticancer drug discovery and hence are in the center of attention of drug hunters .
literature reveals that natural and synthetic chalcones are desirable to elicit cytotoxic and apoptotic activity ( figure 2 ) .
