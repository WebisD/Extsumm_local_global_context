this study reviews previous parasite prevalence reports from american marten in north america , presents data from the parasitological examination of live - trapped american marten in michigan , and identifies a possible association between hookworm infection and anaemia in affected american marten .
american marten infected with hookworms in the current study were found to be at risk for anaemia , and this association warrants further investigation .
the aim of this parasite survey was to describe the presence and prevalence of parasites in the huron - manistee national forest of the nlp and to determine whether there are differences in presence or prevalence of parasites between the nlp and up .
are frequently trapped as a furbearer species , this information could guide prevention of disease transmission to trappers and researchers working with the species .
the majority of previous studies examined american marten carcasses for parasitism , which allows characterization and speciation of the adult parasite and information about intensity of infection .
north american marten are infected with a wide variety of endoparasites , but information regarding the pathologic effects of parasitism remains limited .
however , a non - invasive method of detecting endoparasitism is desired for reintroduction programs and our results provide baseline information about parasites detected by faecal examination from american marten in michigan .
