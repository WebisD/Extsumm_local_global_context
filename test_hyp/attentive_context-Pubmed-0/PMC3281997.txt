therefore , the aim of this study was to compare a broad range of total knee prostheses with different design parameters ( multi - radius , single - radius , fixed - bearing , mobile - bearing , posterior - stabilized , cruciate retaining and cruciate sacrificing ) to determine whether in vivo kinematics was consistently related to design .
not significant mean and standard deviation of the range of knee flexion (  ) , axial rotation of the femoral component and the insert (  ) and anterior - posterior ( ap ) translation ( mm ) of the lateral and medial condyle during the step - up motion for each prosthetic group also , the results of the levene s test and anova are presented .
