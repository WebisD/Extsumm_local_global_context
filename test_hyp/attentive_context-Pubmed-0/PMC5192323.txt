therefore , in this study , we measured the plasma levels of ctrp9 in subjects with t2d representing a wide range of renal function and investigated the clinical association of plasma ctrp9 level with the intima - media thickness ( imt ) of the carotid artery separately in subjects with ckd and in those without ckd .
our data indicate an important link between ctrp9 and carotid arterial wall thickness , a powerful predictor of cardiovascular diseases , in patients with t2d .
in the present study , we measured plasma ctrp9 levels in patients with t2d representing a wide range of renal functions and investigated the impact of plasma ctrp9 level on carotid imt separately in subjects with or without ckd .
neither max - imt (  = 0.039 , p = 0.627 ) nor mean - imt (  = 0.090 , p = 0.259 ) was significantly correlated with plasma adiponectin levels in the ckd group . finally , we performed multiple regression analyses to identify an independent association between plasma ctrp9 levels and carotid imt after adjusting for bmi , plasma adiponectin level , and other potential confounders including age , sex , systolic bp , egfr , hba1c , serum triglyceride level , hdl - cholesterol level , ldl - cholesterol level , smoking status , and presence of treatment with statins and arbs / aceis in the non - ckd or the ckd groups , separately . in the non - ckd group ,
