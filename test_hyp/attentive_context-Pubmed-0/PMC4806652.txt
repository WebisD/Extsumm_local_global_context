the present review focuses on spindle burst activity in the cerebral cortex of the developing rat during the first postnatal week and summarizes our current understanding ( i ) on the functional properties of spindle bursts , ( ii ) the mechanisms underlying their generation , ( iii ) the synchronous patterns and cerebral networks associated with spindle bursts , and ( iv ) the physiological and pathophysiological role of spindle bursts during early cortical development .
since this important type of brain activity is already present in the human fetus in utero ( either spontaneously occurring or related to sensory inputs from the uterine environment ) , a better understanding of the physiological relevance of spindle burst oscillations is of major clinical relevance .
spatially confined spindle bursts and delta brushes represent the most prominent physiological activity patterns in the developing cerebral cortex of newborn rodents and preterm human infants , respectively .
spontaneous and stimulus - evoked spindle bursts can be observed in various neocortical areas of different mammalian species and play important roles in the early development of cortical networks .
network - driven spindle - like oscillations are a functional hallmark of the developing cerebral cortex . during late prenatal and early postnatal stages of development ,
