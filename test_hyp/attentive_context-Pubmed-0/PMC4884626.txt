single - stranded conformation polymorphism ( pcr - sscp ) and heteroduplex analysis ( ha ) .
therefore , the tmc1 gene may not related to nshl , but further studies investigating related mutations in other parts of this gene in iranian population are necessary and could help in the genetic counseling of patients and design of practical strategies for the management of auditory disorder .
since no report has yet determined the frequency of tmc1 gene mutations in the iranian population , the present study was performed to screen and identify the mutations of this gene associated with nshl using polymerase chain reaction 
the findings of the current study indicate that mutations in exons 7 and 13 of tmc1 gene are not related to hearing loss in the iranian population .
one disability that can sufficient to interfere with activities of daily living is non - syndromic hearing loss ( nshl ) ( 1 , 2 ) . people with even mild nshl have problems hearing speech when there is background noise and identifying the sounds sources ( 3 , 4 ) .
the strength of this study was the number of samples , as 890 blood samples were provided ; however , due to a lack of financial resources , we chose two exons of this gene . via the molecular analysis of the tmc1 gene in korean patients ,
