these filters make it possible to treat septic patients with acute renal failure and simultaneously provide the control of uraemia and fluid status as along with cytokine removal . in the field of haematological diseases , particularly in myeloma , early yet encouraging results have already been obtained in the light chain removal .
hence , the interest of clinicians , followed by that of industry , in a new class of dialysis membranes aimed at enhancing the transport capabilities ( clearance ) of middle , large and even protein - bound molecules by using all the available membrane separation phenomena : diffusion , convection and adsorption , by designing and developing both high - performance 
super - flux dialysers based on enhanced convection or adsorption , at least on the theoretical plane , could be widely used in clinical situations in which , apart from toxins of small molecular size , large quantities of mediators and toxic products are also produced , with a negative biological effect at a middle  high molecular weight , or which are rapidly bound to the proteins .
this further confirms a series of observational studies that had already demonstrated that , in terms of patient survival , techniques capable of increasing middle - molecule clearance , such as haemodiafiltration ( hdf ) , hold an advantage over the conventional hd . in recent years , scientists have been increasingly convinced that a large number of high - molecular - weight toxins increase their plasma concentration during uraemia and are responsible for a number of dialysis co - morbidities , such as an immune system imbalance , itching and so on .
