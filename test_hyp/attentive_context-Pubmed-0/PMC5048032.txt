this review presents a brief summary of their role in immunity with specific reference to human and animal tuberculosis and explores their potential as a novel approach to therapy or prophylaxis .
this deterioration in the global situation highlights the need for new therapeutic agents against mycobacterial diseases .
the advantages and disadvantages of the various forms of defensin therapy / prophylaxis against mycobacterial infection of man and animals outlined above indicate that this could be an effective new approach to treatment and prevention of these chronic infections , which are becoming increasingly intractable to chemotherapy .
defensins are a family of antimicrobial peptides that are abundant amid an array of oxygen - independent antimicrobial proteins and peptides in neutrophil granules and secreted by epithelial cells .
the experimental work with mycobacterial infections combined with their wide spectrum of activity suggests that bacterial infections other than those caused by mycobacteria may also be amenable to this approach .
they belong to a family of small ( 35  kda ) cationic cytotoxic and oxygen - independent peptides that are active against a wide spectrum of microorganisms including bacteria , viruses , and fungi .
studies of human airway epithelia in vivo or in vitro show that they can generate antimicrobial activity through the production of antimicrobial peptides   .
