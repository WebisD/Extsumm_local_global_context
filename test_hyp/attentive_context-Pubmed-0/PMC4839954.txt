the objective of this study was to evaluate whether higher blood bdg levels correlate with impaired neurocognitive functioning ( evaluated by global deficit score [ gds ] ) in a cohort of adults with acute / early hiv infection , who initiated art during the earliest phase of infection and achieved suppressed levels of hiv rna in blood plasma thereafter .
, bdg may be an indicator of gut mucosal barrier disruption and an independent biomarker associated with neurocognitive functioning in virologically suppressed hiv - infected individuals with high cd4 counts .
levels of investigated plasma biomarkers ( median and iqr are displayed ) and correlations with gds and plasma bdg levels with regard to combinations of bdg , il-8 , and scd14 and correlation with gds , bdg  +  il-8 ( spearman r  =  0.57 ; p  =  0.01 ) and bdg  +  scd14 ( spearman r  =  0.58 , p  <  0.01 ) were the most promising combinations of 2 biomarkers , whereas the combination of all 3 biomarkers ( bdg  +  il-8  +  scd14 ) had the highest correlation with gds ( spearman r  =  0.71 ; p  <  0.01 ) .
in this cross - sectional cohort study , we measured levels of bdg in blood plasma and csf supernatant samples in a cohort of adults with suppressed levels of hiv rna in blood plasma ( < 50 copies / ml ) , and compared them with established biomarkers of microbial translocation , immune activation , and cognitive dysfunction .
