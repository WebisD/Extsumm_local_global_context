this special issue of fungal genetics and biology describes a comprehensive effort to develop methods and expertise to tackle one of the world s most serious fungal diseases of wheat .
the series of papers within this issue are designed to provide a resource for a new generation of plant pathologists who we hope will be inspired to investigate the biology of septoria blotch of wheat and develop new and durable disease control strategies .
arguably , the first pre - requisite to being able to investigate any disease is a comprehensive description of the life cycle of the organism and the spatial and temporal dynamics of the infection process . for z. tritici
it is by considering these issues that this collection of reviews and primary publications has been put together .
this is remarkable , because it has happened in a very short period of time in response to an acute need , articulated by growers and the agricultural biotechnology industry .
the new methods and resources presented in this special issue mean that the z. tritici research community now has , arguably , the same level of research tools as any fungal model system .
an integrated programme has been funded and undertaken to carry out this method development and to begin to apply the newly acquired expertise to understanding this disease .
