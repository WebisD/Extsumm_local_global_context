this case depicts a clinical scenario of positive dipyridamole stress test in a patient affected by mb of the lad .
a 60-year - old male patient , with a known history of arterial hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus , was referred to the outpatient echocardiography laboratory to undergo stress echocardiography because of recent episodes of chest pain occurring on mild exertion .
thus , the finding of worsening ischemic abnormalities after the administration of atropine ad aminophylline , during dipyridamole stress echocardiography , may represent a particular diagnostic feature of mb .
after atropine injection , a worsening of the anginal symptoms combined with a descending st - depression in v3 occurred ; despite the absence of relevant echocardiographic changes , two - dimensional ( 2d ) strain analysis showed lower longitudinal strain of the anterior interventricular septum from rest to peak dose [ figure 2 ] .
although mb has been classically deemed a benign coronary artery abnormality , it has been recently related to acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death .
the patient was admitted to the cardiology department and underwent coronary angiography from the radial access , which revealed a long myocardial bridge ( mb ) of the left anterior descending ( lad ) artery with systolic  milking  [ figures 4 , 5 and videos 79 ] .
