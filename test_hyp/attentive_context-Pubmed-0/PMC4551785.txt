thus , the purpose of this study was to verify whether the marginal and internal gap of a prosthesis made according to the am method is within the clinically allowable range by conducting a comparative evaluation of the conventional lost wax technique ( clwt ) , the subtractive manufacturing system with wax blank milling ( wbm ) , and am with multi jet modeling ( mjm ) and micro - stereolithography ( micro - sla ) .
together , our results demonstrate that additive manufacturing can be used clinically as an alternative to the conventional lost wax - technique or subtractive manufacturing in the creation of dental prostheses .
the results of the micro - sla method showed a statistically significant difference in outcome compared to the wbm and mjm methods and a significant difference from the gold standard clwt method in the internal gap , but no statistically significant difference in the marginal gap from the clwt method .
are currently the most widely used am method.17 according to the research relating to the stereolithography ( sla ) method , the mean ( sd ) of margin , axial wall , occlusal are 96.9 m ( 17.6 m ) , 84.7 m ( 16.8 m ) , 114.2 m ( 16.7 m ) respectively.17 and as a result of the research , mjm method and micro - sla method showed better fitness value , except the occlusal part in the current study . according to the report of rtorp et al.,16 the mean ( sd ) value of the sls showed the best fitness value , with the measured value 133 m ( 89 m ) , 117 m ( 89 m ) , 166 m ( 135 m ) , and 84 m ( 60 m ) , at all measurement points in the conventional lost wax method , milled wax method , milled co - cr , and sls method . however , according to the earlier research , the mean ( sd ) value of the mg ( absolute marginal discrepancy ) part of premolar and molar made in the sls method showed 132.1 m ( 60.5 m ) and 128.0 m ( 68.8 m ) each .
