our case presented the rare clinical situation of simultaneous bilateral tension pneumothorax , and a decision was made to treat with immediate large size needle decompression at the emergency room by a properly trained doctor .
the procedure was a critical step which restored this patient from life - threatening tension pneumothorax .
the incidence of simultaneous bilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax has been reported to be as low as 1.4% to 7.6% .
indication for surgical management of pneumothorax include continuous air leakage after insertion of chest tube , recurring pneumothorax on the same side , simultaneous bilateral pneumothorax , pneumothorax developed after pneumonectomy , and having an occupational cause . at present , video - assisted thoracic surgery ( vats ) is the most frequently used form of surgery for treating pneumothorax .
an 18-year - old male transferred to the emergency department presented loss of consciousness , cyanosis , and deteriorated vital signs . according to the rescue team transfer records , he called the control center himself because he was home alone .
simultaneous bilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax can result in a severely deteriorated condition , usually requiring intubation or resuscitation .
simultaneous spontaneous bilateral tension pneumothorax is defined as when no tracheal shift occurs and when the degree of bilaterally lung collapse is similar in a chest x - ray .
