in summary , although the majority of studies reported an association between androgenetic alopecia and cad , we were not able to detect any relation between presence , severity and age of occurrence of male pattern baldness and gensini and rentrop scores , which are important measures of presence and severity of cad .
the mean number of diseased vessels was lower in the group with adequate collateral development when compared with those without adequate collateral development ( 2.47    0.5 vs. 2.69    0.4 ; p  =  0.028 ) .
the mean number of diseased vessels was higher in bald subjects when compared with their non - bald counterparts ( 1.71    0.9 vs. 1.44    0.9 ; p  =  0.004 ) . the number of diseased vessels correlated with the severity of baldness ( r  =  0.125 ; p  =  0.005 ) .
the number of diseased vessels was inversely correlated with rentrop score ( r  =    0.226 ; p  =  0.008 ) . in univariate analysis ,
in the present study , we aimed to investigate whether there is an association between male pattern baldness and angiographic cad severity and collateral development , which has not been reported previously . according to our findings , although subjects with higher gensini scores had more frequent and severe baldness , they were older than the group with lower gensini scores .
