finding of the current study showed that the trat gene and pai markers were highly prevalent among upec strains isolated from hospitalized patients in kashan ; hence , they could be considered as useful targets for prophylactic interventions . also , in the current study high resistance was observed against the antibiotics widely used for the treatment of urinary tract infection ; therefore , to reach better therapeutic outcomes , empiric treatment regimens have to be modified .
the current study aimed to investigate the virulence associated determinants as well as their patterns of antibiotic resistance in upec isolated from hospitalized patients with uti .
as carbapenems are advising for the treatment of severe infections caused by esbl - producing e. coli , emerging resistance to this antibiotic is a place of major concern in treating infections caused by such resistant bacteria .   in conclusion ,
of the 150 e. coli strains isolated from uti , 9 ( 6% ) were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials tested whereas 111 ( 74% ) showed resistance to more than three antimicrobial families and identified as multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) .
thirty - nine strains ( 26% ) had only one virulence gene , 72 strains ( 48% ) two genes ; combinations of three virulence genes were observed in 15 ( 10% ) strains .
