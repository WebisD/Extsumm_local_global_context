sub - saharan africa ( ssa ) has been under the scourge of communicable diseases ( cds ) for a long period of time , and sudden deaths ( sds ) are still responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality in the region .
we are of the opinion that a study of this nature will help in mounting a public health campaign against the actions and inactions of our people that are making diseases , which can be easily cured with prompt and adequate antimicrobial treatment , the cause of sd in the 21st century .
a subset of 17 ( 35.5% ) of the sd cases were caused by cds , with ncds accounting for 29 ( 60.4% ) of patients , while immunosuppressive disease and chronic undernutrition accounted for two ( 4.2% ) patients .
we conducted a retrospective study of sd caused by cds in adult patients aged 18 years and older , carried out at the ladoke akintola university of technology teaching hospital ( lautech ) , osogbo , osun state , southwest nigeria .
the most common cause of death worldwide now is cardiovascular disease;5 this is similar for sd.6 before 1900 , the world was in the first stage of epidemiologic transition , which is the stage of pestilence and famine , with infectious diseases and malnutrition emerging as the predominant causes of death ; improvement in public health and nutrition has led to the emergence of the second stage of the epidemiologic transition known as the stage of receding pandemics , with concomitant decline in death rates due to malnutrition and infections.5 the second stage of epidemiologic transition includes hypertension , coronary heart disease , stroke ( predominantly hemorrhagic ) , amongst others.5 a study in saudi arabia reported that the cause of sd in 45 ( 20.2% ) out of 223 cases was due to infectious diseases.7 cds on their own usually present with signs and symptoms , which often continue to worsen over days if left untreated , are poorly treated , or if the correct diagnosis is missed altogether , before finally leading to death . in view of the fact that cds are easily amenable to treatment once sufferers present early , prompt diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is instituted , patients with cd should therefore not present with sd , we therefore consider it important to conduct this retrospective study to find out the proportion of such cases that are presenting as sd .
