, we aimed to investigate the effect of hbm - based education with the purpose of increasing knowledge and the health belief about prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening behaviors .
the primary objective of this study was to increase participation in the screening and for this aim education based on the health belief model was implemented ; then , we investigated the levels of knowledge , scores of the health belief components about prostate cancer , and the rate of participating retired men in prostate cancer screening .
since this type of cancer is treatable in early stages , more attention should be paid to the educational design and planning based on educational theories and models so that we could increase the required knowledge about prostate cancer for early diagnosis and treatment of the disease .
hence , we could confirm the efficacy of hbm in adopting the prostate cancer screening behaviors by the participants .
our findings showed that the health education programs designed based on hbm could positively affect the prostate cancer preventive behaviors of our retired participants by improving their knowledge level and hbm components .
independent t - test revealed a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups with respect to the mean scores of the perceived susceptibility , severity , barriers and benefits after the intervention ( p>0.05 ) compared with before it ( p>0.05 ) .
