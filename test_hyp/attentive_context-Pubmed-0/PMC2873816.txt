, we determined the peak systolic velocity ( psv ) , early diastolic velocity ( edv ) , peak systolic velocity - to - end diastolic velocity ( s : d ) ratio , resistive index ( ri ) , and pulsatility index ( pi ) , and evaluated blood flow waveform patterns in the major arteries of normal conscious immature micropigs .
the s : d ratios of the cranial , middle , and caudal parts of the common carotid artery , cranial and caudal parts of the abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , femoral artery , and renal arcuate artery were 4.14  1.30 , 3.99  0.85 , 4.92  1.56 , 5.61  1.22 , 4.50  1.03 , 5.79  2.25 , 4.77  1.39 , and 2.43  0.31 , respectively ( table 1 ) .
the psv of external iliac artery showed a significantly lower value than the common carotid artery or abdominal aorta ( p < 0.05 ) .
the psv of renal arcuate artery was significantly lower than the other arteries ( p < 0.05 ) .
the lowest edv was observed in the femoral artery , which was significantly lower than the external iliac artery ( p < 0.05 ) .
