hunter syndrome ( mucopolysaccharidosis type ii or mps ii ) is an x - linked metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase ( i2s )   .
mnemonics are commonly employed in clinical medicine as screening tools or to guide clinical management   , and here , we describe the development of a simple mnemonic screening tool that may aid pediatric specialists and primary care physicians in the recognition and diagnosis of hunter syndrome .
the hunter mnemonic had a sensitivity of over 95  % to detect hunter syndrome at a hunter score of 6 or greater and , given the overlap of clinical features , may also help in the identification of other mpss .
the approach described herein illustrates the utility of disease registries in the development of tools that may assist physicians in the diagnosis and management of rare , genetic disorders . as newborn screening for hunter syndrome
validation of this tool in the clinical setting will be required to determine the sensitivity , specificity , as well as positive and negative predictive value of this tool , and to confirm its utility as a screen for hunter syndrome in routine clinical practice .
