sars has increased the medical community s awareness of issues related to occupational health and safety .
a systematic approach , including administrative controls , environmental engineering , protection equipment , and quality control , is advocated to prevent future sars - cov transmission to healthcare workers .
data were collected through interviews of healthcare workers present during the attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation where transmission of sars - cov was thought to have occurred .
the similar symptom onset dates suggest a point source of exposure . in this case , sars - cov was transmitted despite healthcare workers wearing protection equipment designed to protect against contact and droplet transmission ; no breaches in droplet protection equipment were identified , and exposure times were fairly brief . although sars transmission that involved intubation and bipap ( 9 ) have been reported , this episode is unique in that the patient was neither conscious nor breathing at the time of the intubation , and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty .
all information was obtained as part of an ongoing joint investigation into the cause of the second phase of the toronto sars outbreak conducted by toronto public health , health canada , and the centers for disease control and prevention ( 13 ) . a 67-year - old woman with a history of asthma
