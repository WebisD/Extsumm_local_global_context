despite of its high prevalence , dysmenorrhea has not been managed effectively . therefore , due to the lack of comprehensive studies for treatment of digestive disorders accompanied with dysmenorrhea in iran and because of the importance of economic and social aspects of dysmenorrhea and acceptability and availability of traditional medicines , the aim of this study was to assess the effects of cinnamon on menstrual bleeding and systemic symptoms ( nausea and vomiting ) with primary dysmenorrhea in a sample of iranian female college students from ilam university of medical sciences ( west of iran ) during 2013 - 2014 .
some of the factors influencing pain intensity and other symptoms with primary dysmenorrhea such as culture , genetic and nutrition ( 20 , 31 ) were uncontrollable , which were the weak points of this study . in conclusion , this research suggested that cinnamon has a significant effect on reduction of pain , menstrual bleeding , nausea and vomiting due to primary dysmenorrhea , and with respect to no reported side effects , cinnamon can be regarded as a safe and effective treatment for primary dysmenorrhea .
, we used a total dose of 2.52 g daily ( in three divided doses ) , which was effective on primary dysmenorrhea and no side effects were found with this dose . on the other hand , this was the first clinical trial on the effects of cinnamon on menstrual bleeding and systemic symptoms including nausea and vomiting due to primary dysmenorrhea in female college students in iran , which was the strength of this study .
