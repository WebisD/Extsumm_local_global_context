we 
 believe it is important to elucidate the contribution of femoral muscles to toe - gripping 
 strength . in the present study , we investigated femoral muscle activity during toe - gripping to 
 examine the role of the femoral muscles in toe - gripping strength .
the average ( mean  sd ) 
 % iemg values of the rectus and biceps femoris muscles were 7.0%  6.2% and 25.6%  15.9% , 
 respectively .
souma et al.6 studied the % iemg of 
 several crural muscles ( the soleus muscle , medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle , and 
 tibialis anterior ) during toe - gripping in 3 different ankle joint positions10 of plantar 
 flexion and 0 and 10 of dorsiflexion  and reported that the crural muscles help the ankle 
 joint by co - contracting during toe - gripping . in another study ,
