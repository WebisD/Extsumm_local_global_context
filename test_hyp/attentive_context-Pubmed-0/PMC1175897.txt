in the search for new agents to protect the lung from injury , kuklin and colleagues   report that tezosentan , a non - selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist , reduces pulmonary edema in endotoxemic sheep , in parallel with a prevention of protein kinase c- activation .
acute lung injury ( ali ) and its more severe form , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , are syndromes of acute respiratory failure secondary to permeability , non - cardiogenic , pulmonary edema .
european consensus conference on ards defined ali / ards as a " syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability " .
ali = acute lung injury ; ards = acute respiratory distress syndrome ; il = interleukin ; tnf- = tumor necrosis factor alpha .
ali / ards is a major cause of morbidity , death and cost in intensive care units .
the work of kuklin and colleagues   provides important information on the complex effects of endothelin blockers on inflammatory processes . from a clinical point of view , given the prolific nature of the inflammatory cascade causing ali / ards and the angel / devil effects of endothelin receptor antagonists on inflammatory mechanisms , it is unlikely that these single agents could reverse or terminate such a complex process .
