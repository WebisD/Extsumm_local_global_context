therefore , this study was conducted to investigate the presence of both e. coli o157 and e. coli o157:h7 and to detect the presence of the stx1 and stx2 genes in isolates from both cattle carcasses and their rectal samples obtained from two commercial abattoirs located in the samsun province of turkey .
neither of these genes was detected in the 12 e. coli o157 and two e. coli o157:h7 isolates from carcass and rectal samples ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .
while both the stx1 and stx2 genes were detected in 35 e. coli o157 isolates from 17 carcass and 18 rectal samples , they were detected in only one e. coli o157:h7 isolate from a carcass sample .
the results of the present study indicate that meat from cattle poses a risk to human health in turkey because of potential e. coli o157 and e. coli o157:h7 contamination . to minimize the risk to public health , implementation of the haccp system in abattoirs
in the present study , e. coli o157 or o157:h7 was detected in 52 of 200 samples tested ( 49 e. coli o157 and 3 e. coli o157:h7 ) .
the stx2 gene alone was detected in only two e. coli o157 isolates and the stx1 gene was not detected alone in any isolates .
