although , whether universal routine stenting of the ureteroneocystostomy is a real risk factor for the development of severe urinary tract infection ( uti ) after renal transplantation is still controversial . therefore , to help further clarify this issue , we compared the frequency of uti in our cohort of deceased donor kidney transplant recipient transplanted with or without ureteric stent implantation .
anastomotic stenosis rate ( 1.3% ) was similar in the nst versus the st group , urinary leakage occurred in 6.8% of all recipients , 8.3% in st- vs. 5.9% in nst group , respectively .
in multivariate analysis ( table 4 ) the following categorical variables had no impact on the rate of uti : age at transplantation , diabetes mellitus , bmi , duration of pretransplant dialysis , duration of surgery and cold ischemia time . however , female gender significantly ( p < 0.001 ) affected the incidence of urinary tract infection ( 54.0% vs. 33.5% , relative risk 1.4 , 95%-ci 1.2 to 1.8 ) .
we observed fewer episodes of acute rejection in st group ( 22.9% vs. 34.6% , p = 0.024 ) . wound
it is therefore prudent to continue monitoring possible relationship between double - j implantation and uti in renal transplant recipients .
