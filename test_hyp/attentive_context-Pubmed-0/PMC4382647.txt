, we identified two patients ( 4% ) with axillary arch and one patient ( 2% ) with absent pectoralis major and minor muscle among fifty subjects which undergoing axillary dissection for breast cancer surgery .
the anatomy of axilla regarding muscular variations was studied in 50 patients who had an axillary dissection for the staging and treatment of invasive primary breast cancer over one year .
the usual lesion is absence of the sternocostal portion , with or without absence of the pectoralis minor muscle . in a period of one year
during the past two centuries , the anatomical variations of the axilla have been described in both textbook of human anatomy and more recently in those of operative surgery .
the axillary vein was identified and all fatty and lymphatic tissue was removed inferior to the axillary vein , between the anterior border of latissimus dorsi muscle laterally and the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle ( level of first rib ) medially . during the procedure , two individuals with axillary arch muscle and one individual with absent pectoralis major and minor muscles were identified .
axillary arch ( aa ) muscle crossing anteriorly over right axillary vein ( av ) there was left sided absence of pectoralis major and minor muscles in a 45 years old woman operated for left sided carcinoma of breast [ figure 2 ] .
