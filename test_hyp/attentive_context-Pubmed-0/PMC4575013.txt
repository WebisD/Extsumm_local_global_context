the second patient underwent a meso - caval shunt operation after the failure of portal vein stenting .
extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is one of causes of portal hypertension.1 varices at sites other than the esophagogastric region have been reported more frequently in patients with portal hypertension associated with portal vein obstruction than in those with cirrhosis.2 especially in patients who have performed the hepaticojejunostomy , extrahepatic portal vein obstruction leads to the afferent loop varices around anastomosis site.3 extrahepatic portal vein obstruction after pylorus - preserving pancreatoduodenectomy ( pppd ) has been explained by the following : postoperative portal vein thrombosis ; adhesion and inflammation around the portal vein due to lymph node dissection or anastomosis leakage ; and tumor recurrences around the portal vein.4 afferent loop varices may cause recurrent and massive gastrointestinal bleeding , but the early detection of the bleeding focus is difficult.5 the treatments of varices in this area include surgical , endoscopic or angiographic therapies.46 we report 2 cases of afferent loop jejunal varix bleeding at the hepaticojejunostomy site after pppd .
after detecting the varix bleeding using ct and conventional angiography , the treatment of varices in this area is recommended with less invasive approach , such as the angiographic interventions of balloon dilatation and stent insertion . surgical shunt operation can be considered when noninvasive approaches have failed .
