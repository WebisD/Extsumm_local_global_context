this may implicate that the cases with lower levels of mixed th1 and th2 cytokines have a higher probability of having lymph node metastasis . considering the low cytokine expression in the cases with underexpression of p27 ( except for il-4 ) , our results indicate that mixed th1 and th2 immune cytokines have a tendency toward anticancer effects in terms of lymph node metastasis . to predict tumor prognosis from cytokine levels
as aforementioned , after focusing on the cases with lt , the cases with low - grade expression of p27 tended to be associated with lower levels of cytokines than those with high - grade expression of p27 .
the cases with lt had enhanced expression of the cytokines ( tnf- , ifn- , il-4 , il-10 , and il-2 ) compared to the samples of ptc without lt . among the five cytokines ,
the higher expression of cytokine levels had a tendency to be associated with high p27 immuno - reactivity ( table 5 ) .
this study revealed the presence of mixed th1 ( ifn- , tnf- , and il-2 ) and th2 ( il-4 and il-10 ) immunity in lymphocytes in cases of ptc with lt .
