probably lack of motivation , plays a key role in obtaining less desirable results in laboratories in public sectors . in public laboratories
although in most cases implementing the standard requirements are performed in the private laboratories , there is still a long way to absolute fulfillment of the requirements .
regarding too many active laboratories in these two provinces , this benchmark performed in three stages : 
 public hospitals : 84 public hospitals were audited by 60 auditorsprivate hospitals : 54 private hospitals were audited by 70 auditorsoutpatient , private medical laboratories public hospitals : 84 public hospitals were audited by 60 auditors private hospitals : 54 private hospitals were audited by 70 auditors outpatient , private medical laboratories the results of these audits are the main interest of this study . through the discussion and analyzing process we try to compare different processes , their quality and accordance with national standard measures between public and private hospital laboratories .
seasonally , laboratory auditors gather in one selected province to audit a noticeable fraction of its total laboratories based on the national standard checklist ( 3 ) .
there is no financial competition , and no need for licenses renewal through accreditation process , so the pace of progression toward implementation of standards are much slower than what it is in the private sector . taking in to account that public laboratories are providing service to a large number of people , it is strongly recommended that motivation , responsibility and commitment of laboratory directors and technical staff should be increased through incentive programs .
