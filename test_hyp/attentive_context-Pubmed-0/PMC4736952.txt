the objective of this study was to provide insight into the mechanism by which gut / stomach rerouting leads to weight loss and the improvement or resolution of diabetes . in metabolomics ,
finally , the significance of this study lays in the exploration of future treatments for obesity and t2d that can mimic bariatric surgery weight loss and improvement and resolution of t2d .
we took an opposite approach utilizing bariatric surgery tool as the most promising way to affect weight loss and to rectify t2d symptoms in morbidly obese patients .
it is important to point out that , despite age and sex difference , t2d status or bariatric surgery procedure , and coexistence of other associated diseases , all patients demonstrated striking similarity in major metabolome changes associated with preoperation weight - loss diet and bariatric surgery itself .
global metabolomic analysis was used to evaluate the changes occurring in nondiabetic and t2d patients experiencing either less extreme sleeve gastrectomy or a full gastric bypass .
laparoscopic gastric bypass ( gb ) is a more intense surgery that typically results in a 6070% loss of excess weight and is also characterized by improvement or resolution of diabetes   .
