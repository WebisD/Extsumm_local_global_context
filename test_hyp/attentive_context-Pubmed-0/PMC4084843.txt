when coupled 
 with high value experimentation , we posit that the faithful and more 
 efficient conversion of data streams into knowledge will significantly 
 advance major breakthroughs in mechanistic biology and on the front 
 lines of disease research including improved discovery and validation 
 of protein - based biomarkers .
the c - score model lays forth 
 a path to increase the sophistication of protein identification and 
 characterization platforms to extract maximum value from ms - based 
 proteomics in automated fashion .
in sum , we have shown a promising scoring system for protein identification 
 and proteoform scoring to better capture the information content in 
 high - resolution top down proteomics .
non - bioinformaticists / non - proteomicists  
 to advance protein - based science based on proper description of the 
 fully articulated primary structure for whole proteoforms .
we describe the implementation 
 of this bayesian approach to scoring , and compare one set of generative 
 models to the prosight ptm expectation value used within prosightptm 
 and prosightpc .
the conceptual and demonstrable advances 
 outlined above provide a deterministic process to advance the utility 
 of proteomics for nonexperts .
we show that our implementation , with its current generative models , 
 provides an improvement over the existing scoring system as measured 
 by area under the curve ( auc ) on the resulting roc chart ( auc of 0.99 versus 0.78 for a complex human 
 example and auc 0.85 versus 0.80 in pseudomonas ) .
