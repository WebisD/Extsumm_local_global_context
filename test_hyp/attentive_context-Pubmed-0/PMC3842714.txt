comparison of periapical index score within groups at baseline and at 6 months the sd of area measured immediately after obturation for the groups were 8.14 ( 8.40 ) , 9.57 ( 9.20 ) and 4.32 ( 5.20 ) respectively and area after 6 months were 5.4 ( 5.7 ) , 6.80 ( 8.11 ) and 4.14 ( 3.93 ) respectively .
this study was done to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of mta or epoxy resin as a root canal sealers compared to zinc oxide eugenol sealer using gutta - percha as the obturating material in teeth with periapical radiolucency .
comparison of pain between groups measured by vas at baseline , 1 week and at 6 months comparison of pain within group measured by vas at baseline , 1 week and at 6 months there was a highly significant ( hs ) difference in the pai score was found on comparing the base line and at 6 months
mta has performed equally well when compared with the zinc oxide eugenol and ah plus .
group 2 was found to have more vas score ( p = 0.19 ) than other two groups but was statistically not significant ( p = 0.19 ) .
