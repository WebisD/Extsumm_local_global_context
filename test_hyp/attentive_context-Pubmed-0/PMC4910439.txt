much of the published scientific literature regarding the epidemiology of influenza has focused on influenza a , and we still have a relatively poor understanding of the global epidemiology and disease burden of influenza b. several studies have reported on the burden of disease attributable to influenza b in a single season , or during consecutive seasons in a single country   . in order to improve our understanding of the burden and epidemiology of influenza b , we reviewed the influenza b viruses circulating in italy from 2000 to 2015 .
our results on influenza b virus infections in italy are timely , in view of the recent introduction of a tetravalent influenza vaccine containing influenza b viruses of both the victoria and yamagata lineages .
incorporating viral and epidemiological data will help obtain more accurate estimates of influenza disease burden and result in a better selection of strategies for influenza prevention and control .
our study reveals that influenza b virus was the predominant overall cause of influenza in two of the 13 influenza seasons from 2000/01 through 2012/13
our study demonstrates that influenza b virus infections are associated with substantial morbidity and that influenza surveillance and interventions including vaccination and treatment are still suboptimal .
