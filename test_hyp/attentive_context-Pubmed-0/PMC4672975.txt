the definition of a gerbode defect , according to the society of thoracic surgeons congenital heart nomenclature and database project is true left ventricular ( lv ) to right atrial ( ra ) communication .
zacharkiw and stimpson   recently described this pathology as a  mirror - image gerbode defect in a patient following atrioventricular ( av ) septal defect repair . in the present study , the case of a congenital la - rv shunt in an adult is presented and the classification of such defects is discussed .
a 74-year - old woman was referred to our center with a worsening history of orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and peripheral edema .
however , no sources provide a definition encompassing congenital right ventricular ( rv ) to left atrial ( la ) communication .
the previously reported congenital case was a 39-year - old woman with a common av junction and partially separated right and left av orifices , and the shunt was exclusively from the la to the rv due to overriding of the left av valve .
a literature review demonstrated that it is virtually impossible to categorize the spectrum of av septal defects into satisfactory and noncontroversial subgroups with regard to patients such as ours .
