a 32-year - old healthy caucasian lady presented complaining of recent deterioration of vision in her left eye . at presentation , her best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) was 20/20 in her right eye and counting fingers in her left eye ( le ) .
complete and systemic examination was unremarkable , excluding the possibility of wyburn - mason syndrome .
fundus examination and fluorescein angiography revealed findings consistent with arteriovenous communications of the retina or racemose hemangioma , in the posterior pole of the le with the presence of macular ischemia .
eight years after presentation , findings and bcva in the le have remained stable , with no extension of the retinal ischemia or development of neovascularization .
although extensive retinal ischemia has been reported to result in complications such as retinal or iris neovascularization , in our case the macular ischemia has not expanded further over a period of 8 years . however , due to this macular ischemia the patient unfortunately lost her central vision .
racemose hemangioma is rare . the development of extensive retinal ischemia including macular ischemia resulting in rubeosis has been reported .
it has been postulated that either an enlarged malformation using part of the blood supply of the retina may cause ischemia , or there was a partial thrombosis which caused circulatory stasis within the lesion.6,7
