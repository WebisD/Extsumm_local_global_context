progressive neurologic deterioration or back and leg pain in children with a history of myelomeningocele ( mmc ) surgery may be due to cord tethering or growth of an intradural inclusion tumor .
here , we report a child who developed progressive neurological deterioration and severe back and leg pain subsequent to large infected dermoid tumor extending underneath the skin to the spinal canal and intramedullary area .
a 3-year - old boy was referred to neurosurgical department because of severe back and leg pain and motor regression .
tethered cord syndrome should be investigated in any patient with a history of mmc repair if one finds neurological , orthopedics , or urological deterioration .
the operative field should be explored accurately proximal and distal to the sac to find any associated anomaly or minute inclusion tumor and prevent late inclusion tumor formation and tethered cord .
dermoid tumor is considered as an important differential diagnosis during thorough evaluation of the causes of worsening . in order to minimize the risk of dermoid tumor development following mmc surgery , any residual epidermal or dermal elements
loss of motor function in the lower extremities , gait abnormality , back or leg pain , scoliosis , and foot deformity are common findings in postsurgical tethering .
