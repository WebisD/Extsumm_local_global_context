distribution of acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores ( number of patients in vertical bars on the y1 axis ) and mortality rate ( solid line on the y2 axis ) distribution of organ failures ( number of patients in vertical bars on the y1 axis ) and mortality rate ( solid line on the y2 axis ) a subset of 1718 patients were admitted within 24 h of a study day , of which 1627 patients could have an apache ii diagnostic category assigned to enable calculation of the predicted mortality . of these
, we used a point prevalence design , obtaining data on four different days over a 1-year period .
highlights include a moderate severity of illness with relatively high mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock , patients on vasopressors or inotropes or receiving mechanical ventilation .
the apache ii and sofa scores , public hospital icus , medical icus , inadequately equipped icus , medical admission , self - paying patient , the presence of svspss shock , acute respiratory failure ( pao2 /fio2 ratio < 300 ) or cancer , and the need for a fluid bolus and mv were independent predictors of mortality .
