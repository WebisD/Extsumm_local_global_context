a promising area of research is on the development of sarm agonists for increasing lean body mass and muscle strength in hypogonadal men and in cancer and immunodeficient patients .
androgen antagonists will be approved for new clinical uses , including the treatment of hirsutism in women , alopecia in men and acne in both sexes .
androgen receptor antagonists have found therapeutic use in the treatment of androgen - responsive prostate cancer for over two decades .
new sarm antagonists with improved tissue specificity , such as with reduced effects on the hypogonadal axis , will emerge for prostate cancer monotherapy , as well as for skin indications .
new laboratory tools , such as the availability of crystal structures of the receptor for rational drug design , will facilitate the discovery of new sarms .
this has been taken advantage of pharmacologically , with the generation of specific inhibitors of the enzyme for the treatment of androgen - dependent disorders .
nevertheless , it is possible to see a day when tissue - specific androgens of many flavors will be of great medical benefit .
the next section will review new classes of non - steroidal androgen receptor ligands that are in the public domain .
