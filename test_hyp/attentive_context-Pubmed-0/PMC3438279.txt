we believe that transphyseal reconstruction produces satisfactory results for the treatment of acl tears in adolescents with open physes without the risk of leg length discrepancies or abnormal alignment in the coronal plane .
, we performed acl reconstruction in skeletally immature patients and evaluated the long - term functional and radiological outcomes of the surgery at the time of skeletal maturity .
the mean amount of leg length growth from the time of surgery to last follow - up was 4.6 cm ( range , 3.1 - 9.6 cm ) on the operated side and 4.7 cm ( range , 2.9 - 9.6 cm ) on the non - operated side ( table 2 ) .
a total of 158 patients with 18 years of age underwent transphyseal acl reconstruction at our institution between january 1993 and december 2008 .
in contrast , utmost care should be taken in determining an appropriate treatment timing and method in late adolescents ( around the age of 15 years ) with skeletal immaturity . in this study
the possibility of tanner stage 5 was ruled out because there was no radiographic evidence of growth plate closure and 3 cm leg length growth was observed after surgery in all of them . on the preoperative knee function , the ikdc level was categorized as c ( 68% ) in most of the cases : a in 1 case ( 4% ) , b in 2 cases ( 8% ) , c in 17 cases ( 68% ) , and d in 5 cases ( 20% ) .
