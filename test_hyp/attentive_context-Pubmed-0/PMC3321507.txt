we reviewed the canine liver transplantation model as i / r injury model to delineate in detail the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton that are probably the determinants in changing the phenotype of hepatocytes to cholangiocytes , which seems to be a post - transplant event occurring in the liver at an earlier stage than frank cholestasis . here , we speculate that i / r liver injury through a phenotypical switch of the liver cells may contribute to the poor outcome of the liver graft .
cholestasis is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing liver transplantation , and the steps reaching this state are not completely understood .
i / r injury is a major cause of liver graft dysfunction resulting in adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) decrease , evidence of intracellular acidosis , and cell swelling of the hepatocytes .
the organ dysfunction is considered multifactorial , but ischemia and reperfusion ( i / r ) injury is probably the most important contributing factor , although the detailed steps of pathogenesis are controversially debated .
however , graft dysfunction remains a problem affecting up to one - third of the recipients , despite reports of good to excellent long - term outcome .
