we describe three children who presented with bulbar difficulties and had either receptor - associated protein of the synapse ( rapsn ) or cholinergic receptor , nicotinic , and epsilon ( chrne ) mutations , causing postsynaptic cms .
bulbar dysfunction as an initial presentation of cms is not widely reported in the literature .
congenital myasthenic syndromes ( cms ) are inherited disorders of neuromuscular transmission caused by various genetic defects at presynaptic , synaptic , or postsynaptic levels .
these three cases highlight the fact that in any infant or young child with unexplained swallowing difficulties , the possibility of a myasthenic disorder warrants consideration . with the availability of molecular genetics these conditions
can now be diagnosed early and specific treatment initiated , thus preventing morbidity and mortality .
they are characterized by fatigable weakness involving ocular , bulbar , and limb muscles with the onset in the early years .
cms are currently classified based on the site of defect as presynaptic , synaptic based lamina associated , and postsynaptic , with the latter being the commonest .
an early recognition of this genotype can prevent death in a condition , which is easily treatable with a good long - term outcome .
