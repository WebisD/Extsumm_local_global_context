was a concentration of 5.72 ng / ml ( sensitivity 53.8% , specificity 57.14% , odds ratio ( or ) 1.6 , 95% confidence interval 
 ( ci ) = 0.4 - 6.3 ) , 
 for spli a concentration of 56.5 ng / ml ( sensitivity

 specificity 62% , or 2.6 , 95% ci : 0.6 - 10.8 ) , and for svcam-1 a concentration of 
 290 g / dl , ( sensitivity 76.9% , specificity

. 
 therefore , we aimed to determine the above substances in the 
 amniotic fluid of women , undergoing second trimester amniocentesis 
 and subsequently delivering pre- or full - term infants .
in contrast , slpi levels 
 in second - trimester amniotic fluid were significantly higher in 
 the group of women who delivered either preterm ( p < .007 ) or at 
 term ( p < .001 ) with absence of ruptured membranes prior to 
 delivery ( see figure 1 ) . furthermore , a statistical 
 significant correlation existed between elastase and spli 
 ( r = 0.508 , p < .002 ) .
