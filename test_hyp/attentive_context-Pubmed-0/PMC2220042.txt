the objective of this study is to investigate and compare the functional role of ghrelin on the regulation of energy balance in children with cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart disease and the association of ghrelin with tnf- , il-6 , that were not entirely confirmed in literature by now .
additionally , the relation of ghrelin with cytokines 
 may be explained by the possible effect of chronic congestive heart failure and chronic shunt 
 hypoxemia .
serum tnf- values were higher in the acyanotic patients compared to the cyanotic patients with chd ( p<.001 ) .
serum ghrelin levels were significantly higher than in acyanotic and cyanotic groups compared to in the control group   ( p<.0001 ) ( table 3 ) . 

patients with acyanotic 
 heart disease had a greater growth deficit in weight , and those with cyanotic 
 heart disease had a greater growth deficit in stature as demonstrated by both 
 decreased height and weight .
the study was conducted on 47 children with acyanotic chd , 21 children 
 with cyanotic chd , and 25 healthy children .
serum il-6 levels were higher than in cyanotic and acyanotic patients with chd compared to in the control groups   ( p<.0001 , p<.001 , resp . ) . in both acyanotic and cyanotic groups ,
