our results convincingly show that veterans ptsd is related to lower levels of marriage quality of their wives , who often encounter problems in their intimate / partner relationships .
the result also highlights the importance of recognizing ptsd in wives of traumatized veterans as well as the importance of family approach in the treatment of ptsd .
linear regression analysis for the overall das scores for wives and husbands   notes : bsi , brief symptom inventory ; das , dyadic adjustment scale ; ptsd , posttraumatic stress disorder . results ( table 2 ) show that clusters b , c , and d of ptsd symptoms , hostility , and depression scores of wives and veterans explain up to 33.8% of female partner 's marital satisfaction and up to 17.6% of veteran 's marital satisfaction .
differences in the das total score between groups notes : das , dyadic adjustment scale ; ptsd , posttraumatic stress disorder .
finally , the result of our research confirms the negative effect of war veterans ptsd on the quality of their marital relations , especially when both partners suffer from ptsd .
this result demonstrates that in couples where both partners have ptsd , each of the partners creates his / her own system of functioning that may help them in carrying the burden of the chronic disease , but at the same time , it produces a negative impact on the spiral of mutual adjustment and marital quality ( nelson goff & smith , 2005 ) .
