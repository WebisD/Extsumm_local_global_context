a 55-year - old man was admitted to the general ward at a gyeongsang national university hospital with an obstructive hydrocephalus visualized by brain magnetic resonance imaging .
central neurogenic hyperventilation was developed in a patient receiving high - speed irrigation and large amount of normal saline ( maximum infusion rate of 1000 ml / min and maximum pumping pressure of 500 mmhg ) during an endoscopic third ventriculostomy , which may be ascribed to a transient hypothalamic dysfunction and/or acidic csf .
the complication rate for endoscopic third ventriculostomy ranges from 6% to 8% , and is similar to the expected infection rate of a shunt .
a > 30 mmhg pressure inside the endoscope is associated with postoperative morbidity , particularly unexpected delayed recovery .
otherwise , the operation and anesthesia were uneventful . in order to rule out a postoperative hemorrhage , brain computerized tomogram taken immediately after the endoscopic third ventriculostomy revealed the external ventricular drainage catheter and pneumocephalus on the left frontal convexity .
the capacity of the male elderly lateral and third ventricle is 35.19  20.35 and 2.63  0.96 ml , respectively . our findings and those of previous reports [ 8 - 10 ] suggest that the ph in the csf and arterial blood should be measured simultaneously to confirm the respiratory alkalosis caused by normal saline irrigation - induced csf acidosis .
