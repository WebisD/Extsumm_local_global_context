the case is framed here in a description of the radiographic findings as a function of the mechanism of injury relative to similar cases , the surgical decision making involved in safe extraction of intracranial foreign bodies via modern modified skull base technique , and considerations for antibacterial prophylaxis .
intracranial foreign bodies via the transorbital route are rare.1 amongst cases of transorbital intracranial injury , projection of the foreign body through the superior orbital fissure occurs in an estimated 68% and damage typically occurs to the brainstem , cavernous sinus , or temporal lobe.2 introduction of a foreign body via the orbit can occur either via missile projection or via stab injury , and the trajectory into the brain may be related to the mechanism of injury.23 obtaining a thorough history and establishing a high level of suspicion for these types of injuries when periorbital trauma is found on physical exam is important , as in the case of missiles the patient may be unaware that a foreign body was retained24 and stab injuries may be associated with psychiatric illness that may limit reliable history .
567 here we describe a unique foreign body within the brain : the bristled end of an electric toothbrush , which entered the parenchyma of a patient 's right temporal lobe as a projectile through the medial orbit .
