the samples were divided into three experimental groups ; group i : sealapex , group ii : tubliseal and group iii : ah26 with 12 samples in each group .
however , many studies showed no significant difference between these techniques.1 the aim of this in vitro study was to quantitatively evaluate the sealing properties of three different root - canal sealers ; tubliseal , sealapex and ah26 using a spectrophotometric method .
, tubliseal showed a significant difference ( p > 0.005 ) . in comparison to sealapex
it is important to remember before declaring any root canal sealer as most acceptable that the results of the dye penetration studies indicate only the relative sealing ability of root canal fillings in vitro and they do not indicate their ability to prevent the penetration of bacteria into filled root canals in vivo .
in the present study , tubliseal sealer showed least microleage compared with sealapex and ah26 sealer .
thirty - six extracted sound mandibular molar natural teeth specimens with complete root and free from caries or cracks were collected , stored , disinfected and handled as per the recommendations and guidelines laid down by occupational safety and health administration and centers for disease control and prevention.4 the teeth were then placed in 0.9% physiologic saline solution for ten days prior to access cavity preparation .
