the results suggest that oxidative stress in patients with cancer , demonstrated by elevated levels of these modifications in urine , may be typical not only of affected tissue but also of other tissues and even the whole organism . from practical point of view , a test that would enable determination of background levels of basic markers of oxidative stress ( 8-oxogua and 8-oxodg in urine and 8-oxodg in dna in leukocytes ) , might be applied as an additional and helpful marker for early detection of the development of cancer .
compared a group of cancer patients and healthy volunteers with regard to the amount of 8-oxogua and 8-oxodg excreted in urine , demonstrating elevated levels of oxidatively modified base in patients when compared with healthy subjects by 50% .
an assay was performed to analyze levels of 8-oxogua and 8-xoxdg in urine samples with regard to diet . in case of the examined group
our work indicates the levels of these derivatives elevated to such an extent can not be related to its increase in cancer cells exclusively .
