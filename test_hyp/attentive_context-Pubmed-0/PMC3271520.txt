it is known to cause a serious complication , hyperammonemic encephalopathy which is characterized by acute onset of impaired consciousness , headache , vomiting , seizures , ataxia , generalized slowing on electroencephalography and rapid recovery after discontinuation . in this submission , we present a case of valproate - induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy where the major manifestation was restricted to bilateral cerebellar clinical features .
sodium valproate is a frequently used drug for the treatment of seizure disorders , bipolar disease and chronic pain .
a 19-year - old male presented with acute onset tremulousness , staggering gait and difficulty in walking and speech .
thus we conclude that valproate - induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy can present mainly with cerebellar ataxia and a high index of suspicion is required for an early recognition , investigation , and treatment of this potentially life - threatening condition .
patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of cranium , which turned out to be normal . with this background of clinical observations and laboratory assessment , a diagnosis of valproate - induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy
he was a known case of idiopathic generalized epilepsy treated initially with carbamazepine ( 800 mg / day ) and recently switched over to sodium valproate ( 1000 mg / day ) before the onset of this acute complication .
