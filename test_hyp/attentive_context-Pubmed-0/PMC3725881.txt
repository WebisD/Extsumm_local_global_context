kme had marked inhibitory effects on the development of obesity and nafld in mice fed high - fat diets . activating endurance capacity and increasing thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms for the antiobesity effect of kme .
we measured the inhibitory effect of kme on adipogenic factors in 3t3-l1 cells and on the development of obesity and nafld in mice fed a high - fat diet .
our data show that kme suppresses adipocyte differentiation through down - regulation of adipogenic factors and could ameliorate obesity and nafld in mice fed a high - fat diet .
this finding suggests that kme may be a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nafld .
our results indicate the great potential of kme as a potential metabolic regulator of adipocyte differentiation and a potential therapeutic agent for preventing or treating obesity and nafld .
one study found that mitochondrial oxphos activity within the oxidative soleus muscle , which is resistant to fatigue and is dependent on mitochondrial activity for atp production , was more affected than in the glycolytic muscle tibialis anterior .
the main changes included a reduction in respiratory chain activity with a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial atp production . in line with this finding and previously ,
