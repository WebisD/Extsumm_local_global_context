recognition of the doppler and cross - sectional imaging manifestations of normal and abnormal hepatic graft vasculature is essential for appropriate and timely management to ensure graft salvage . in cases of inconclusive ultrasound findings , a multimodality approach ,
this review of the normal sonographic post - transplant vascular anatomy and the imaging appearances of the major hepatic artery , portal vein , and venous outflow tract complications that may occur will assist the radiologist in identifying post - transplant vascular pathology .
orthotopic liver transplantation is an important treatment option for patients with end - stage liver disease . in the united states
sonography is the primary imaging tool for diagnosis of early and delayed vascular complications in liver transplant patients . after rejection ,
ultrasound with doppler is the primary imaging modality for the evaluation of hepatic transplants , providing detailed assessment of vascular flow in the graft .
this article describes the vascular anatomy of liver transplants and imaging appearances of the major vascular complications that may occur within the hepatic artery , portal vein , and venous outflow tract .
post - operative complications , however , can limit this success , especially if not recognized early enough to allow for graft salvage . among the most common and clinically significant complications to occur in the post - operative period are those of vascular origin .
