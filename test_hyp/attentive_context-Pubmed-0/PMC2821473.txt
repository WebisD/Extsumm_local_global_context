these studies have revealed that the consequences of ccn2 overexpression are not necessarily predictable and that the manifestation of ccn2 fibrotic activity in vivo involves crucial interactions with co - stimulatory signals in the microenvironment .
for well over a decade , the association of connective tissue growth factor ( ccn2 , also known as ctgf ) with fibrotic diseases has been the driving force behind many investigations designed to understand its biology and biochemistry .
the recognition of ccn2 as a matricellular protein rather than a conventional growth factor ( rachfal and brigstock 2005 ; leask and abraham 2006 ; chen and lau 2009 ) requires us to think differently as to how this molecule is involved in fibrosis . collectively , its multi - domain structure , association with the extracellular matrix , utilization of multiple receptors on the cell surface ( integrins , heparan sulfate proteoglycans , low density lipoprotein receptor - related protein , nerve growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor ) , binding interactions with other cell - regulatory molecules ( tgf- , insulin - like growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ) , and propensity for proteolytic cleavage into various bioactive fragments adds many layers of complexity to its mode of action and we have either a very rudimentary understanding or no knowledge at all as to the importance of these or other factors in determining the fibrotic response to ccn2 .
