the relationship between saliva and plasma et-2 and et-3 isoforms is comparatively less well understood . because of the emerging significance of all three isoforms in health and disease , notably the role of et-2 in the cardiovascular system , in ovulation , immunology , and cancer , we sought to extend the data on the relationships between the three endothelin isoforms in concurrent saliva and plasma samples .
the isoform et-2 correlates poorly with et-1 and et-3 , within saliva and within plasma .
salivary et isoform profiles portray the plasmatic profiles and support the view of coordinated regulation of et-1 and et-3 , but distinct regulatory pathways for et-2 .
our data confirm an overall positive correlation between plasmatic and salivary bet-1 , et-1 , et-2 , and et-3 levels and between the bet-1 , et-1 , and et-3 within each of the two compartments .
however , although saliva et-2 correlated with plasma et-2 ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.004 ) , the poor correlation between et-2 and the other endothelin isoforms , within plasma ( positive , p > 0.05 ) and within saliva ( negative , p > 0.05 ) , is in line with the concept of et-2 regulatory pathways distinct from those of et-1 and et-3 . in conclusion ,
