dual - goal achievement was associated with a lower risk of cabg ( 0.62   ) and the composite cardiovascular end point ( 0.87   ) .
was associated with a significantly reduced risk of microvascular complications ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.79 [ 95% ci 0.760.82 ] ) , acs ( 0.88   ) , pci ( 0.78   ) , and cabg ( 0.74   ) , but not of the composite cardiovascular - related end point ( 1.00   ) ( fig .
the study results showed that , compared with the achievement of only the ldl - c goal , achievement of both hba1c and ldl - c goals is associated with a lower risk of microvascular complications , acs , and cardiovascular surgeries ( pci or cabg ) , lower utilization of health care resources , and lower costs of care , but no additional effect was observed for the composite cardiovascular - related end point .
p < 0.05 ; * * p < 0.01 ; * * * p < 0.001 . after adjusting for demographics , diabetes - related complications , comorbidities , surgical procedures , diabetic medication use , and health care utilization , dual - goal achievers incurred significantly lower annualized diabetes - related medical service costs compared with those who achieved only the ldl - c goal ( $130.89 ; p = 0.016 ) , but no statistically significant difference was observed between dual - goal achievers and hba1c goal achievers ( $56.17 ; p = 0.404 ) ( fig .
