in addition , the mcol pathogenicity islands contain genes that code for the drra - c transporter , which is involved in the transportation of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( pdims ) and also contains the rmt2 and mmpl4 genes , which are involved in the synthesis and transmembrane transportation of glycopeptidolipids ( gpls ) . using the edgar tool for comparative genomics analysis of a selected set of mycobacterial genomes we detected a total of 452 singletons , which represent 8.4% of the mcol genome . according to a classification of these singletons into functional clusters of orthologous groups ( cogs ) categories 87 genes are involved in cellular processing and signaling , 75 are involved in information storage and processes , 163 are involved in metabolism of mcol and 122 are grouped as poorly characterized ( fig .  2 ) .
mycobacterium avium complex ( mac ) contains clinically important nontuberculous mycobacteria and is the second largest medical complex in the mycobacterium genus after the mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) complex .
we attempted to find the mcol virulence factors from the genome sequence to decipher its possible skills as a mac opportunistic pathogen .
however , we detected a total of 45 genomic islands ( nine of these are classified as pathogenicity island ) , which contain a total of 320 predicted genes .
