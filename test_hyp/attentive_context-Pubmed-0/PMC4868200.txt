the final results showed that , compared with the baseline , the mean mbi scores of the 
 experimental and control groups increased significantly from 53.5 and 55.1 to 66.8 and 61.2 
 ( p<0.05 ) , respectively , and that the mean bbs scores increased significantly from 30.2 
 and 31.9 to 38.6 and 35.7 ( p<0.05 ) , respectively .
the 
 objective of the study was to determine which is better in the rehabilitation of stroke 
 patients , core stability exercises or conventional exercises .
third , there was a lack of 
 long - term follow - up in the study , and it is unclear whether the effectiveness of core 
 stability exercises will decrease in patients with hemiplegia with time .
in addition , mbi scores were 
 significantly lower ( p<0.05 ) in the control group than in the experimental group .
the exercises in both 
 groups were performed for one hour per day , six times a week for six weeks . the modified barthel index ( mbi)13 and 
 berg balance scale ( bbs)13 were used to 
 assess the clinical outcomes of the two groups .
participants with stroke - induced hemiplegia were recruited from the department of neurology 
 of yidu central hospital of weifang between january 2014 and february 2015 .
