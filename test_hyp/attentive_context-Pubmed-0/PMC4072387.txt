hence , this study has been designed to provide a baseline data on the mandibular dimensions of yemeni adults with normal normal dento - skeletal relationship , aged ( 18 - 25 ) years .
based on this study it could be said that among studied mandibular dimensions in subjects with normal dento - skeletal relationship , the inter - canine distance showed the strongest linear relationship with the mandibular arch sizes .
overall , the male group displayed greater transverse and sagittal mandibular dimensions ; however , this was only statistically significant for measurements of inter - first and second molar distances and anterior arch length ( p < 0.05 ) .
relationship between the mandibular widths and lengths shown with the corresponding spearman correlation coeficients ( r ) statistically significant correlations between the inter - canine distance and mandibular arch lengths were noted , but the r values were not greater than 0.5 .
mandibular arch dimensions ( mm ) according to gender the correlation coefficient was calculated between arch widths and lengths ; some of them were highly significant , positive and direct relationship was noted , others showed moderate , weak or negative relationships [ table 3 ] .
