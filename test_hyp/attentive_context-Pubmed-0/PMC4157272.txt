six cases were reported from 2007 to 2012 to the oral and maxillofacial unit of annaswamy mudaliar general hospital , bangalore , out of which four patients were males with the lesion occurring between the second decade of life and sixth decade of life [ figures 1a3c ] . in all cases ,
treatment of ameloblastic carcinoma is wide surgical resection and if evidence of nodal metastasis is present , neck dissection should also be considered .
this small series of cases illustrates the malignant portion in the spectrum of ameloblastomas and it is possible that ameloblastoma may show a wide variety of histologic and biologic behavior ranging from benignity to frank malignancy .
cases of ameloblastoma should be studied carefully , correlating their histologic pattern with biologic behavior to detect changes in histology that may predict aggressive behavior . when a case is diagnosed as ameloblastic carcinoma , assessment of nodal metastasis and evidence of distant metastasis
ameloblastic carcinoma is a lesion with histologic behavior that dictates a more aggressive surgical approach than that of a simple ameloblastoma .
all cases exhibited enlargement of cortical plates with perforation , pain and tenderness with regional lymph node enlargement , with three cases showing fixed submandibular groups of lymph nodes ( level ib ) and in one case parasthesia of inferior alveolar nerve .
