on the other hand , since the tissue 
 penetration of the nir laser is limited to around ten millimeters , 
 an alternative strategy for activatable dissociation of the nanoassemblies 
 are needed to apply this system to treatment of drug - resistant metastatic 
 tumors .
furthermore , this 
 dna - based nanoassembly platform can accumulate chemotherapeutic drugs 
 in the nuclei , thus greatly enhancing their therapeutic efficacy against 
 drug - resistant cancer cells by effectively bypassing p - gp .
this proof - of - concept 
 structure also opens a new door in the use of nanoassemblies for the 
 design of drug delivery systems for biological and clinical research . 
 to comprehensively evaluate the superiority of this nuclear - uptake 
 nanodrug delivery system
in summary , we have developed a dna - based 
 nanoassembly platform for cancer therapy . unlike traditional intranuclear 

transport strategies of nanoparticles , no nuclear 
 localization signal ( nls ) peptides are required in our design , and 
 the nuclear uptake of nanodrugs is mainly attributed to small particle 
 size , thus avoiding complicated nls modification processes and maintaining 
 the valid occupancy of drug - loading probes on the np surface . by using 
 this photocontrolled , size - transformable nanosystem , nanodrugs can 
 be efficiently transported across the cell membrane and enter the 
 nucleus in a coordinated and harmonious manner .
