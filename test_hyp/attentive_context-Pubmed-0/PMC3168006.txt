one of the most common forms of amyloid proteins are amyloid light chain ( al - type ) , which is derived from plasma cells , contains immunoglobulin light chains and is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias .
they originate either in bone ( osseous plasmacytoma ) or in soft tissues ( extramedullary plasmacytoma ) .
fine needle aspiration smears of a 50-year - old female patient with cervical lymphadenopathy were sent to the department of pathology without any clinical details .
the head and neck region has been reported as a frequent site for amyloid deposits .
it can occur as the sole manifestation of plasma cell neoplasm , as a metastasis from another extramedullary plasmacytoma or as a consequence of multiple myeloma .
it has no characteristics of multiple myeloma , but the development of multiple myeloma has been observed in 836% of patients months or years later .
thus , the diagnosis of plasmacytoma with amyloidosis was suggested and confirmed by a histopathology study of the biopsy tissue .
this amorphous material was interpreted as caseous necrosis and the possibility of tuberculous lymphadenitis was suggested .
it can be primary , without evidence of disease in other foci , or part of a systemic process during the course of multiple myeloma .
