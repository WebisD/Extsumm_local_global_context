the presence of neurosarcoidosis requires more prolonged higher - dose treatment with steroids and immunosuppression from the outset , with early recourse to biological agents should the clinical and radiologic features of the disorder fail to improve quickly .
this investigation includes a series of blood investigations and imaging ; when these investigations found no evidence for a demyelinating disorder ( through mri features principally ) , systemic autoimmune condition ( e.g. , antinuclear antibodies , dna , aquaporin-4 , and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies ) , or infectious or metabolic causes , a granulomatous cause was considered , and further investigations were undertaken .
criteria for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis involved histologic proof ( in 40 cases ) of a granulomatous disorder currently active or requiring continuing treatment or ( in 12 cases ) adequate proof on clinical grounds that no alternative explanation existed for the systemic disorder in the minds of the treating physicians : for example , clear radiologic evidence for lung and mediastinal involvement together with clear evidence for another characteristic feature of the disease , such as hypercalcemia , raised serum angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) or other tissue involvement , associated with a typical pattern of isotope uptake using gallium scintigraphy or pet .
