the work of wu and colleagues   is in accordance with the recent concept of sepsis - induced immunosuppression .
there is now agreement that many severe septic patients survive the first critical hours of the syndrome but eventually die later in a state of immunosuppression that is illustrated by patients ' difficulty to fight the primary bacterial infection , decreased resistance to secondary nosocomial infections and reactivation of viral infections normally solely pathogenic in the immunocompromised host .
the most frequently assessed biomarker in the field to date is undeniably the measurement of hla - dr expression on circulating monocytes ( mhla - dr ) .
there appears to be general consensus that diminished mhla - dr is a reliable marker for the development of immunosuppression in critically ill patients . indeed , decreased expression of this marker
this potential aspect now deserves to be validated in multicentric clinical studies using standardized flow cytometry protocols .
is regularly reported to be associated with higher mortality / risk for nosocomial infections in critically ill patients .
consequently , immunostimulatory therapies might be used to restore immune functions in the most immunodepressed patients . in the absence of any specific clinical signs of immune failure , however , it is beforehand critical to determine the best biological tools ( markers of septic patients ' immune failure ) enabling patient stratification .
