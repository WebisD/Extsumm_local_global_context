phenylketonuria ( pku ) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism , which is caused by mutation in phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) gene .
we reported a patient with classic pku and his parents harboring a large deletion in exon 3 ( ex3del4765 ) of pah gene .
in addition , identification of the mutation type could help family genetic counseling , especially in the prenatal diagnosis ( pnd ) of future pregnancies and this is one of the strong points of our study . finally , discovering the deletion of exon 3 in pah gene in iranian population could assist us in better molecular diagnosis of patients with pku and their family members .
this finding may help improve early detection , differential diagnosis , genetic counseling , and even treatment of patients with pku .
most of the pah mutations are missense mutations ( 67% ) , which are followed by small or large deletions ( 13% ) .
a 15-day - old male was referred to genomic research center in summer 2014 in tehran due to high level of blood phe detected in the routine national framework of pku neonatal screening ( table 1 ) .
