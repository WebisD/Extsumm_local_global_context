in addition , the effect of bowel circumstances on rf ablation should be investigated before its application in cases involving unresectable gastrointestinal lesions .
while the results of this experimental study are encouraging , determination of a more accurate algorithm for applying radiofrequency energy to tissue within the gastrointestinal tract will require further investigation and long - term follow - up in animals .
a total of 40 ablations were performed in the excised livers , showing that the dimensions of the thermal lesions increased both with elapsed time and increased rf energy levels .
rf thermal ablation using high - frequency electrical current is now an accepted procedure for the control of certain tumors . for both sexes , carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract was the leading cause of cancer death in the united states in the year 2000 , with a 5-year relative survival rate of only 5% . in about 58% of patients with esophageal cancer and 40% of those with gastric cancer ,
we developed a stent - like electrode that consisted of four parts : an introductory sheath , a stent , a tube through which a guide wire is passed , and an adaptor ( fig .
