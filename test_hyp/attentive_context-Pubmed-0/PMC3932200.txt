the purpose of this study was to determine if there is a difference between ultrasound guided core biopsy and fna in their ability to detect metastatic disease in the axillary lymph nodes of patients with a current diagnosis of ipsilateral breast cancer .
retrospective comparisons of fna and core accuracy in the axilla have been performed   , but to our knowledge , only one other prospective study   has been published directly comparing fine needle aspiration to core biopsy of an axillary lymph node for the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer .
the decision to perform core biopsy versus fna should be based on the pathologist 's experience in interpreting cytology and the accessibility of the lymph node .
fine needle aspiration is a good alternative to core biopsy when a smaller needle is desired due to node location or other patient related factors .
the mean pain score for fna was 2.0 and for core was 2.4 while the range was from 1 to 8 for fna and from 1 to 10 for core . reported pain levels were similar during fna and core in 63 patients ( 60% ) , greater with core in 31 patients ( 29.5% ) , and greater with fna in 11 patients ( 10.5% ) .
