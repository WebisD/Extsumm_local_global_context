mmol / l ; serum calcium , 9.8  0.8 versus 9.7  0.6 ; serum phosphorus , 4.4  0.3 versus 4.93  0.34 ; systolic blood pressure , 117  5 versus 119  6 mmhg ; diastolic blood pressure , 70  4 versus 71  3 mmhg ; and plasma klotho , ng / ml 3.375  1.48 ng / ml versus 1.39  0.43 ng / ml ( p < 0.05 ) .
the demographic characteristics and measurements of the athlete group and the controls , respectively , were as follows : age , 18  22 versus 18  27 years ; body mass index , 22.3  1.4 versus 24.9  1.3 kg / mg ; total cholesterol , 5.3  0.4 versus 5.7  0.3 mmol / l ; triglycerides , 1.5  0.1 versus 1.7  0.15
for this purpose , plasma klotho levels were measured in a group of trained athletes .
the control subjects were within close range of the previously proposed klotho concentrations for normal individuals , while the athlete group had significantly higher plasma klotho concentrations .
the results of this study showed that aerobic exercise training induces an increase in plasma klotho levels .
we found no significant differences between the groups for total cholesterol , triglycerides , and blood pressure .
