the current series of 12 patients with brain abscesses retrospectively analyzed the levels and chronological changes of body temperature , leukocyte , and serum crp for the purpose of making an early and reliable initial diagnosis .
therefore , the early diagnosis of brain abscess , proper estimation of causative organisms from the source of infection , and appropriate usage of antibiotics are mandatory .
twelve patients with brain abscesses treated between 2006 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed ( table 1 ) .
half of the patients in the current series were diagnosed inaccurately in the initial stage , and it took 7.2 days to achieve the final diagnosis of brain abscess for the misdiagnosed patients .
cure was obtained in 100% of the patients with imipenem therapy , in contrast with 86.7% of patients with the conventional chemotherapy , including penicillin and metronidazole .
bibliographically , the average time between the onset of the symptoms and confirmed diagnosis was 9.6 days .
the difficulties in making an early diagnosis are responsible for the residual high mortality , in spite of the advent of antibiotic treatment .
the crp was elevated to a high level ( 221.6 mg / dl ) in 69.271.4% of patients on admission , and 25.650% of abscess patients were febrile ( 37.839.8c ) at the time of admission . however , the value of these inflammatory indices were generally lower than the ones reported in the non - ventriculitis group of the current series .
