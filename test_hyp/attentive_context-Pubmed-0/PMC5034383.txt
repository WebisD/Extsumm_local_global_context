the establishment of the state of israel problematizes a single definition of jewishness ; the state was founded on secular socialist principles , relies on religious jewish law , and was built by waves of diverse jewish immigrants from europe , north africa , and the middle east , with varying levels of jewish religious practice . maintaining a steady stream of jewish immigrants is crucial to israeli state - building , facilitating the integration of world jewry , and fulfilling the state 's mission as homeland and refuge for all jews .
in light of the ambiguity of the meaning and importance of jewish genes , coupled with the prospect that they may become a criterion for citizenship in israel , it is not yet clear : why genes ?
molecular genetic tests can now be used to measure individuals whole genomes , and scientific research has begun to describe the genetic basis for a common ancestry of the whole of the jewish population .
the law was amended to include a definition of jew :  for the purposes of this law , 
but , the  authenticity of jewish immigrants for israeli state - building  has been judged ( often simultaneously ) in both religious and bioethnic terms. the population registry law 57251965 requires residents to enter both their le'oum ( nationality or ethnic group ) and religion in the registry . a recent israeli supreme court case affirmed an earlier precedent and distinguished le'oum or nationality , from secular citizenship .
