robot - assisted surgery is equivalent to standard laparoscopic surgery in terms of complications and length of stay , with both having significantly increased operation times but reduced length of stay compared with open surgery .
our objective in this study was to compare results using the robot system with that of laparoscopic and open techniques in our pediatric patients to determine the potential for acceptance as a standard approach in this population .
following irb approval , 150 charts of patients who underwent nissen procedures from 1994 to 2005 were divided into 3 treatment groups defined by technical approach , either robotic ( r ) ( n=50 ) , laparoscopic ( l ) ( n=50 ) , or open ( o ) ( n=50 ) .
in the 150 nissen cases included in this study , patients were younger and smaller in the open group ( 8555 months , 2417 kg , p<0.05 ) compared with those in the robotic ( 11764 months , 3723 kg ) and laparoscopic groups ( 10771 months , 3324 kg ) ( table 1 ) .
the most common indication for the procedure was reflux refractory to medical management either as the sole reason or associated with failure to thrive or neurological impairment , or both of these [ r = 39(78% ) , l = 50(100% ) , o = 34(68% ) ] .
