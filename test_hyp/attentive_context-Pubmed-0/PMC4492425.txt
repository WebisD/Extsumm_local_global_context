the group with high physical fitness ( > 75% ) according to the 6-min walk , 30-s chair stand test , 30-s arm curl test , and 8-foot up and go test scores and grip strength had lower fall efficacy points than the cut point suggested by delbaere et al .
the risk of falling can reportedly be reduced for those who exercise regularly , but few studies have examined its correlation with physical fitness . the purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between physical fitness and falling fears in the elderly .
therefore , a regular exercise program that can enhance muscle strength , muscle endurance , cardiovascular endurance , and agility should be emphasized .
there was a significant correlation between 6-min walk , 30-s chair stand test , 30-s arm curl test , chair sit and reach test , back scratch test , and 8-foot up and go test scores , unipedal stance , grip strength , and fall efficacy ( p<0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . the mean fall efficacy was 25.499.4 , higher than the fall efficacy risk score ( < 23 ) .
analysis of fall efficacy after the division of each physical fitness item into quartiles showed that fall efficacy was lower as physical fitness increased . moreover , the group with the highest level of physical fitness ( > 75% ) had the lowest risk of fall efficacy compared to the group with the lowest level of physical fitness ( < 25% ) .
