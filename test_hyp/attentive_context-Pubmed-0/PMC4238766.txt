may 
 contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of hepatitis c and , consequently , 
 to the development of new therapeutic strategies against the interaction of hcv 
 structural proteins and the hepatic endothelium .
, we provide evidence that endothelial cells , such as huvecs , are 
 susceptible to e2 hcv envelope proteins . in conclusion , stimulation with e2 protein induced huvecs to produce inflammatory and 
 angiogenic factors . considering that endothelial inflammation is a determinant of 
 fibrosis progression and cirrhosis , we propose that these cellular effects might be 
 involved in the persistence and chronicity of hcv infection . these results
we 
 suggest that oxidative stress , as demonstrated by the production of no and 
 h2o2 in huvecs in response to e2 proteins , may represent the 
 stimulating factor of vegf - a production .
consistent with this 
 hypothesis , we found that e2 proteins were able to induce apoptosis and several 
 inflammatory responses in huvecs .
the e2 proteins were capable of inducing the production of il-8 compared with 
 non - stimulated cells .
tnf- : tumour necrosis factor alpha ( 10 ng / ml ) ; * * * : p 
 < 0.001 compared to the negative control . 
  to further explore the mechanism of e2 protein - induced apoptosis , we investigated the 
 degradation of parp , which is thought to be one of the targets of activated caspase-3 or 
 7 during apoptosis ( yang et al .
