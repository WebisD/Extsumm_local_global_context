a left seminal vesicle cyst and left kidney agenesis were found on examination , and the patient qualified for laparoscopic removal of the left seminal vesicle cyst .
we present the case of a 26-year - old patient admitted to the urology department because of abdominal pain .
seminal vesicle cysts are rarely diagnosed , but symptomatic congenital seminal vesicle cysts are reported in the literature describing zinner syndrome .
a tachosil ( takeda pharmaceuticals , zurich , switzerland ) hemostatic sponge was placed in the ledge after cutting the base of the seminal vesicle .
the aim of this study was to evaluate usefulness of the laparoscopic technique to remove a cystic seminal vesicle .
the peritoneum was incised between the bladder and the rectum to reveal the left seminal vesicle , which was resected from the surrounding tissue .
the patient was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day and remains symptom - free after 12 months .
histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of a seminal vesicle cyst , and renal agenesis and stenosis of the vas deferens suggests zinner syndrome .
the diagnosis of a seminal vesicle cyst with renal agenesis and stenosis of the vas deferens is suggestive of the very rare condition of zinner syndrome .
