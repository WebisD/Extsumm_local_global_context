esthesioneuroblastoma is an uncommon malignant neoplasm that arises from the olfactory neuroepithelium1 and is typically located in the upper nasal cavity and cribriform plate.2 in this article we report a case of esthesioneuroblastoma presenting concomitantly with a growth - hormone ( gh)-secreting pituitary macroadenoma .
the combined open and endoscopic management of this patient is described , and a review of the literature presented .
in this patient , complete resection of an esthesioneuroblastoma was achieved using a combined open craniofacial and endoscopic approach , followed by a complete endoscopic resection of a gh - secreting pituitary macroadenoma , resulting in endocrinologic cure .
the patient is a 52-year - old woman who presented with a 9-month history of recurrent sinusitis refractory to a repeated course of antibiotics .
the relative indications and advantages of the expanded endonasal approach for anterior skull base malignancies are illustrated .
to our knowledge this is the first case of synchronous esthesioneuroblastoma and macroadenoma , in this case gh secreting , described in the literature .
it is generally accepted that complete resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy reduces the rate of local recurrence in patients with esthesioneuroblastoma38 and improves disease - free survival.39 
 40 chemotherapy remains a matter of debate in upfront treatment , with typical indications being high - grade , recurrent , metastatic , or unresectable tumors.41 in some centers , neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used with success prior to standard craniofacial resection 42
