the transillumination technique , irrespective of the method of enamel preparation , caused greater microleakage in both interfaces at the gingival margin and thus should not be used as the method of curing in orthodontic treatment .
within the limitations of this study , use of self - etching primer and conventional light curing method caused less microleakage compared to the transillumination technique .
comparison of groups based on the method of enamel conditioning revealed no significant differences at the incisal and gingival margins in any of the interfaces ; but at the mesial and distal margins , only group seven ( self - etching primer + direct illumination ) showed significantly lower microleakage score in comparison with group five ( acid - etching + direct illumination ) ( p=0.001 ) .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of transillumination as a light curing technique on the amount of microleakage , in comparison to the conventional technique of curing , using two methods of enamel conditioning .
all groups showed microleakage at the incisal and gingival margins ; but in comparison between conventional and transillumination groups , significant differences were observed only between incisal and gingival margins in the transillumination group ( p<0.001 ) .
