several molecular factors have been investigated in the past years for their application in the early detection and identification of chronic pid caused by c. trachomatis infection . although there is already a diagnostic method ( medac chsp60 elisa test ) ,
the objective of this study is to analyze molecular factors that may help to make the diagnosis and prognosis of pid in the different stages of the disease .
membrane proteins in c. trachomatis , which are known to be related to inflammation and chronic pid , may be candidates for commercial antibody development for avoiding harmful infections .
pelvic inflammatory disease ( pid ) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract ( ugt ) .
the article search focused on covering all scientific publications of pid and related molecular factors published between 1996 and 2010 .
the other discussed host molecular factors are thought to be of interest as new potential markers in the diagnosis at different stages of the disease ; however , further investigation and clinical trials will have to be carried out .
intra - abdominally , traveling from the cervix to the endometrium , through the salpinx , and into the peritoneal cavity ( causing endometritis , salpingitis , tuboovarian abscess , or pelvic peritonitis ) ; through the lymphatic systems , for example , infection of the parametrium from an intrauterine device ( iud ) ;   through hematogenous routes , for example , with tuberculosis , although this is rare .
