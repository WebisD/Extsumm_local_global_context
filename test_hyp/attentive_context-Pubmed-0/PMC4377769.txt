 centrifugal tpe with citrate anticoagulation is an alternative to membrane - based tpe and heparin anticoagulation.membrane-based tpe may require substantial doses of heparin to anticoagulate the extracorporeal circuit .
therapeutic plasma exchange ( tpe ) is used for many indications in patients presenting to a variety of medical disciplines .
here we describe three patients with unequivocal indications for therapeutic plasma exchange who were all treated with both mtpe and ctpe .
membrane - based tpe may require substantial doses of heparin to anticoagulate the extracorporeal circuit .
both , plasma is selectively removed and replaced typically with human serum albumin or fresh frozen plasma , chosen on the basis of the indication for tpe and patient clinical parameters .
membrane therapeutic plasma exchange ( mtpe ) and centrifugal therapeutic plasma exchange ( ctpe ) are both well - established techniques . in
therapeutic plasma exchange is a well - established treatment for renal diseases . over a 5-month period , we had the opportunity to compare the ease of use , safety and reliability of mtpe and ctpe methods in three patients with severe renal disease .
