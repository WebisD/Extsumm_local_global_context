the prime aim of this study is to examine how the two measuring instruments , the self - report and the clinical interview , developed by the toronto - based group differ in their ability to detect the presence and intensity of alexithymia within the anorexic patients families . despite its widespread use and unquestionably easy application in research domains
considering the interesting results of the aforementioned study , the prime aim of this research was to use a multimethod measurement to assess alexithymia in anorexic adolescent patients and in their parents .
for such a purpose two different instruments were chosen , a self - administered questionnaire and a structured clinical interview , tas-2033,34 and the toronto structured interview for alexithymia ( tsia).35 both instruments developed by the toronto - based group are theoretically similar , thus enabling a comparison of their sensitivity and ability to detect the presence and intensity of alexithymic components in families of anorexic patients .
results seem to indicate that the clinical interview may be a more sensitive instrument compared with the self - report , allowing data integration on the functioning of adolescent anorexic patients and their parents .
significant discordance was found between the two measures , both in the total as well as in the components of alexithymia , common to both scales ( f1-dif , f2-ddf , f3-eot ) .
