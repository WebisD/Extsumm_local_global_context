comparing results of the same statistical model across four longitudinal studies of aging , we observed relatively few consistent associations between social activity and cognitive functioning . looking at within person change in social activity and the four cognitive measures , the most consistent finding was an association with fluency in two of the three studies measuring it , after adjusting for linear effects of time and other covariates . change in social activity was associated with memory performance in only half of the four studies ( sls and vls ) . in only one study , octo - twin ,
change in social activity was significantly related to performance in all three of the cognitive domains considered ( fluency measure not available ) .
social activity in the octo - twin study was defined by the number of people with whom participants had contact , whereas the other studies included a range of activities with a social component . given that within person decreases in performance were seen across all cognitive measures in all studies , the positive relationships generally represent attenuated decline , rather than improvement in cognitive performance .  
baseline social activity levels failed to predict rate of decline in most cognitive abilities , and changes in social activity were not consistently associated with within person fluctuations in cognitive functioning .
