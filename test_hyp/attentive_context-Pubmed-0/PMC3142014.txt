in the middle - aged community sample of stroke- and dementia - free framingham offspring participants , we observed that clinical diabetes and various metabolic indices associated with diabetic and prediabetic states were associated with the subclinical changes of smaller brain volumes and poorer cognitive performance , especially on tests of executive function and visual memory .
these results extend the body of evidence linking metabolic dysfunction to the risk of dementia and ad in late life .
these results suggest that clinical trials attempting to delay cognitive and structural brain loss by controlling metabolic dysfunction , even in individuals free of clinical diabetes and as early as the 7th decade , might be warranted .
the relationship between diabetes and cognition was reported > 85 years ago , when miles and root ( 12 ) observed that patients with diabetes did not perform as well as control subjects in tests of memory , mental arithmetic , and psychomotor efficiency .
diabetic and prediabetic states characterized by ir , hyperinsulinemia , and hyperglycemia , when present in late middle age , are related to decreased brain volume and lower cognitive performance on executive function and memory tasks .
there was an interaction with insulin levels , so that this apparent beneficial effect was only seen in subjects who also had elevated plasma insulin levels and was not seen in the subsample of participants who were not receiving insulin . stratifying participants according to their diabetes status at examination cycles 5 and 7 revealed that the cross - sectional association between diabetes and tcbv was present only in those participants who had diabetes at both examination cycles ( diabetes duration 4 years ; p < 0.001 ) and not in those who developed diabetes only at examination 7 ( p = 0.113 ) .
