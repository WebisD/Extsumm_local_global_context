here we present three cases with definite or probable involvement of anaerobic bacteria , where hbo was used with a favourable outcome .
recent availability of hbot with intensive care facilities at our hospital has led to three hbo treated cases all demonstrating a significant clinical improvement .
cervicocranial necrotizing fasciitis ( cnf ) is a more superficial infection , and descending necrotizing mediastinitis ( dnm ) is a deep manifestation of this group of diseases .
a 67-year - old man in previously good condition , experienced a sore throat and dysphagia for 5 days . on admission to hospital
we also show that hbot may be used on the basis of only strong clinical suspicion of anaerobic infection .
in each of these three cases we diagnosed the patient with an extensive soft - tissue infection of the neck and mediastinum .
lemierre 's syndrome ( ls ) is a manifestation with anaerobic aetiology and septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein .
the cases demonstrate that use of polymerase chain reaction is especially useful in the diagnostics of anaerobic infections . when hbot is available , it should be considered as adjunctive treatment in extensive infections with anaerobes , but more studies are needed to evaluate the effect .
