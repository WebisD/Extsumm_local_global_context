this case report documents a lymphangioma of the small bowel mesentery , incidentally discovered on pelvic ultrasound and initially thought to represent a complex cystic adnexal mass .
a 42-year - old female presented with a history of chronic iron deficiency anemia and menorrhagia for several years .
the cyst fluid showed signal loss on chemical shift t1-weighted mr imaging due to the microscopic fat content of chylous fluid  a very suggestive finding for a lymphangioma that helps to differentiate it from other etiologies of cystic lesions in the abdomen .
in conclusion , intra - abdominal lymphangiomas are rare entities , which although are typically asymptomatic , can result in life - threatening complications . in our case , the lesion was discovered incidentally on imaging for an unrelated clinical indication and demonstrated interval growth at 1 year warranting a surgical referral . as of the present time , the surgical consultation has not yet been conducted and our diagnosis is based on imaging . our findings were those of a thin - walled multiloculated cystic lesion , lacking both mass effect and enhancement , and which insinuated around vessels within the small bowel mesentery .
the clinical presentation of lymphangiomas varies from incidental discovery on imaging to presenting with an acute abdomen .
