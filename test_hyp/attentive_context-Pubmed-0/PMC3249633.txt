we will review the studies of cytoskeletal proteins in the nucleus and propose possible mechanisms that regulate their nuclear localization .
in addition to the linc complex , which links the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton by sun - kash protein interactions penetrating through the nuclear membrane , the two compartments may be directly connected via the exchange of structural molecules . to fully understand the biological significance of the cytoskeletal proteins in the nucleus , the molecular mechanisms of their nuclear translocation should be clarified .
nuclear signaling is fundamentally important for cells to properly orchestrate adaptive responses to various environmental changes and functional requirements .
there is increasing evidence , however , that many types of cytoskeletal proteins are localized to the nucleus , suggestive of their direct involvement in the transmission of nuclear signaling and the regulation of nuclear functions ( table 1 ) .
the cytoskeleton has a well - organized and dynamically regulated subcellular architecture composed of core filaments and various accessory proteins . a variety of cellular signaling events are supported by cytoskeletal / scaffold components , which in some cases constitute structural hubs for signaling and/or in other cases contribute directly or indirectly to signal transduction .
