wherever in the course of a phylogenetic analysis mitochondrial data are used which at best reflect matrilineal history , a closer look at nuclear dna ( ndna ) is indispensable to answer questions concerning phylogenetic history in their entirety . when drawing a comparison between evolutionary pathways of the pyruvate dehydrogenase e1 ( pdha1 ) subunit and mtdna , j. hey showed that 
this interactive map searching feature and the presence of meta information predestine hvrbase++ as a database for population genetics analysis . among other databases , like mitomap ( 11 ) as a general resource for mtdna - related data and the  mtdna population database ( 12 ) for forensic studies , hvrbase++ contributes to the wide area of mtdna analysis .
hvrbase was originally started as compilation of hypervariable region i ( hvri ) and hypervariable region ii ( hvrii ) mitochondrial sequences ( 1,2 ) .
furthermore , mtdna variation correlates with the geographic origin of the population , and has been linked to a wide range of degenerative diseases , preferentially affecting the central nervous system , heart , muscle , renal and endocrine systems , and is generally used in forensic comparisons ( 810 ) .
