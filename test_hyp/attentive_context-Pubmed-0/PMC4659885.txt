central to acquiring data for medical use is data acquisition and utilization technology in remote medical technologies .
furthermore , to support remote medical services in the iot environment , previous studies have attempted to change services in accordance with sub - elements , and there is a constraint in that the entire structure should be restructured when security elements are added or a new service is created . accordingly , there is a need for a method and structure that can satisfy the security demands of existing remote medical services and can dynamically support security demands regarding newly created ser vices . in short , there is a need for studies regarding a new method and structure for remote medical services in the iot environment .
this study aimed to provide flexibility regarding new services and security elements through a service - oriented structure .
remote medical services can largely be classified into the following three categories : ' telemedicine ' , which allows for initial diagnosis by the doctor viewing the condition of the patient via a device that supports video imagery ; ' remote monitoring ' , which allows for constant checking of information for an extended period of time and personalized diagnosis for treatment of chronic illness ; and lastly , ' remote con trol ' of remote diagnosisremote treatment , etc . , which utilize new information and communications technology .
