we report four cases of hemicrania continua and a patient suffering chronic paroxysmal hemicrania completely responsive to cox-2 inhibitors .
indeed , some reports in the literature indicate the usefulness of the cox-2 inhibitors in the treatment of indomethacin - responsive headaches   .
anyhow , in our experience celecoxib is a good option treatment for patients suffering from hemicrania continua or chronic paroxysmal hemicranea that presents indomethacin adverse effects .
although indomethacin is usually well tolerated , some patients developed gastrointestinal side effects , specially those patients who require long term therapy
we present five patients suffering indomethacin - responsive headache case 1 suffering from paroxysmal hemicranias and cases from 2 to 5 from hemicranias continua ( table  1 ) .
all of them have absolutely response to indomethacin , but the presence of adverse reactions or intolerability let us discontinued and introduce celecoxib with completely recovery of the symptoms.table  1clinical characteristics of the patientscaseagegenderheadache typesidedoses ( mg)time in month142fhpleft20012256mhcleft40010378fhcleft40018464fhcright40010576mhcleft4006all doses correspond to celecoxibf female , m male , hc hemicrania continua , hp hemicrania paroxistica clinical characteristics of the patients all doses correspond to celecoxib f female , m male , hc hemicrania continua , hp hemicrania paroxistica indomethacin is consider the first - choice drug for the treatment of  indomethacin - responsive headaches  , and the headache resolution is consider as a diagnosis criteria in some of theses headaches .
