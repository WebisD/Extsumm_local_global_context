this article aims to review the use of pet imaging to promote the understanding of activated microglia in neurodegenerative disease .
hence , the measurement of tspo uptake using pet provides an in vivo tool to monitor progression and severity of neuroinflammation and is a useful indicator of active cns disease .
inflammation coupled with the presence of activated microglia seems to be a common feature of a wide range of cns diseases .
provides a valuable tool that allows us to track the progression and severity of neuroinflammation in the living brain , and is a useful indicator of active cns disease .
however , despite a large number of research studies , the exact role of microglia in chronic neurodegenerative diseases remains uncertain . in line with the high plasticity of microglia that allows them to perform numerous cns functions , microglia are likely to play a dichromatic role in disease , depending on signals present in their microenvironment and the duration of activation . while early microglial activation could represents a beneficial response ( i.e. , removal of cns threat , promoting tissue repair and removal of misfolded protein ) , chronic exposure could induces detrimental effects by promoting neuronal death ( i.e. , through the sustained release of neurotoxic factors ) , thus , contributing to progression of disease . pet imaging with the use of tspo radioligands
