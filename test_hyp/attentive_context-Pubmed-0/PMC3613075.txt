further research is needed on the causal relationship between team - based research and dissemination and implementation of evidence - based quality improvement . with advances in team research and increased funding opportunities to investigate dissemination , implementation , and improvement strategies in healthcare , the gap between what works and what is actually practiced will narrow to raise the quality of care delivery .
this project demonstrated the effectiveness of a transdisciplinary model for academic and clinical scientists that are interested in studying improvement .
most services and resources were positively rated in terms of quality , but those related to organizational structure , study objectives , and communication were rated highest by respondents ( > 90% ) .
specifically , researchers and clinicians need to adopt strategies that redefine relationships and establish new ways of communicating   .
the results from this study show promise for enhancing research on improvement and uptake of best practices using transdisciplinary collaboration .
this challenge is echoed by leaders in the field of quality improvement who have identified shortcomings , such as a lack of rigorous research methods , a failure to study contextual variables , and weak evaluation designs   .
a survey on the quality and importance of isrn coordinating center services and resources was sent to a total 30 site pis and coordinators .
