the results found were very promising ; it may be concluded that modified quechers method of extraction followed by cleanup silica gel packed solid phase extraction combined with gcms for quantitation is an efficient method for determination of low concentration of selected group of pahs in homogenized fish samples .
the aim of this study is to adapt and validate quechers method   for extraction followed by solid phase extraction for sample purification and gas chromatography mass spectrometer gcms for determination of 16 pahs in fish at low loq level .
this method is suitable for laboratories engaged daily in routine analysis of a large number of samples , and the loq of the method is sufficiently attained low in order to be used in the national monitoring program of egypt for determination of pahs in fish as well as in imported and exported fish following codex regulations .
the maximum level for the determination of pahs in fish was 2  g / kg wet weight and the recovery range of the methods used should be 50120% , indicating that the validated method complies with these criteria .
the extraction efficiency was consistent over the entire range with indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(g , h , i)perylene being the most affected compounds where their recovery at lower level was 65 and 69% , respectively , and at the second level was 61 and 56% .
