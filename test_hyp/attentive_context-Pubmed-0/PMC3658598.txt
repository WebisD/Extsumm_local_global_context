it was designed to simulate field situation where ducks that have varying levels of ndv antibodies undergo immunosuppression in the presence of high ndv challenge .
thus , the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of immunosuppression on the viral persistence and immune status of ducks .
the effect of immunosuppression with dexamethasone in ducks appears to be the same as that induced by aflatoxin in chicks with ndv infections .
thus , immunosuppression seems to have epidemiologically significant effects on ndv carrier ducks having varying antibody titer levels .
furthermore , the ducks showed progressively declining antibodies titres to very low levels making them more susceptible to infection by challenge nd virus , thus leading to clinical disease and virus excretion .
this may , in part , explain the observation that treatment with glucocorticoids increased virus yield and lethality in mice infected with coxsackie virus .
immunosuppression induced by injection of dexamethasone in the three treatments influenced the pattern of antibody response and the ndv recovery rate .
seven days after the booster dose , the ducks were divided into two groups , each with 32 birds , namely , low antibody level group ( 1  :  32 ) and medium antibody level group ( 1  :  64 ) .
