we present the synthetic protocols and the 
 inhibitory potency 
 on enzyme level , as well as the activity in a cell - based assay , of 
 the new inhibitors ( d and e ) .
also included 
 are stability and permeability studies of selected compounds , together 
 with x - ray analyses of three of the inhibitors cocrystallized with 
 the hiv-1 protease .
the change in binding pattern between 
 the inhibitors with two- and three - carbon spacers was in good agreement 
 with the observed variation in enzyme binding activity .
three inhibitors were cocrystallized with the 
 hiv-1 protease enzyme providing information about the binding of the 
 hydroxy lactams to the enzyme .
functionalization of the two most 
 potent stereoisomers ( 3r,4s ) ( 13a ) and ( 3r,4r ) ( 13d ) with heteroaromatic moieties in the p - benzyl p1 position improved the potency , rendering ki values down to 0.7 nm and ec50 values 
 down to 0.04 m .
we have successfully introduced -hydroxy 
 -lactams 
 providing a rigid backbone moiety and replaced the previously used tert - hydroxy group with a sec - hydroxy group . 

more than 25 years after the identification 
 of the causative agent 
 of aids , hiv / aids is still a major challenge to society . 
 the latest who / unaids report ( 2010 ) states that the number of people 
 living with hiv has risen to 33.3 million , with more than 2.6 million 
 new cases annually and almost 5000 aids - related deaths per day . with the introduction of the first hiv-1 
 protease inhibitor ( pi ) 
 ( saquinavir ) in 1995 and the development 
 of highly active antiviral therapy ( haart ) the clinical 
 outcome of hiv
