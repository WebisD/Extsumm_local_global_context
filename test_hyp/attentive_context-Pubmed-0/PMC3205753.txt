this case report discusses a patient with unicentric mixed type cd associated with hashimoto thyroiditis , for whom staging and evaluation of response to therapy was done with fdg - pet / ct .
there is insufficient data in the literature about the role of [ f]fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg)-positron emission tomography ( pet)/ct in staging and evaluating response to treatment .
the standard for staging of the disease is contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) .

cd is a polyclonal lymphoproliferative disease , characterized by lymph node enlargement with distinctive histological and clinical features .
we suggest that due to the rapid progression and high metabolic activity of the mixed type variant and the plasma cell variant , assessment of treatment response can be done with pet - ct .
this case report shows that fdg - pet / ct can have an important role in the staging and evaluation of treatment response in cd .
