based on the above facts , this study was conducted to determine the role of educational intervention ( patient - based teaching ) to improve the prescribing skill of ii year medical students .
two groups of 25 students were selected randomly from ii mbbs to participate in this study .
patient - based approach for prescription writing enables students to develop prescribing skills in a complete and professional way along with adequate medical knowledge .
the control group included all the 25 students who were posted to surgery postings and the test group included whole of the 25 students who were posted in general medicine department .
the use of real patients in teaching prescription writing should be considered more widely , as it provides strong contextualization and more relevance to learning .
students of control group were trained on prescription writing by explaining five clinical conditions using case scenarios in the department of pharmacology . after allowing the participants of both the groups to undergo self - study for 2 days
there was a significant difference between groups in writing the doctor s particulars , patient particulars , diagnosis , quantity of the drugs and duration of medications to be taken , follow - up particulars and doctor s signature .
