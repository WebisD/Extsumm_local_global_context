we employed pse as an efficient and mild approach to obtain the 
 first mof that contains a multinuclear , organometallic , nonprecious - metal - based 
 proton reduction catalyst .
the resulting uio-66-[fefe](dcbdt)(co)6 is a hybrid material that combines the advantages of molecular 
 catalysts with a highly ordered and stable inorganic support .
incorporation of the fe2 complex in uio-66-[fefe](dcbdt)(co)6 results in a higher stability under the photocatalysis conditions , 
 protects reduced species from nonproductive charge recombination , 
 and may promote disproportionation reactions to produce catalytically 
 active dianion 1 .
uio-66-[fefe](dcbdt)(co)6 exhibits 
 high efficiency for photochemical hydrogen evolution , exceeding that 
 of the homogeneous reference system in terms of rate and total hydrogen 
 production yield .
x - ray absorption 
 spectroscopy ( xas ) was used to confirm the coordination environment 
 of the fe2 site in the mof .
[ fefe](dcbdt)(co)6 ( 1 ) is among the most complex structure that 
 has ever been introduced into a mof , and its presence and molecular 
 integrity within the uio-66 framework could be confirmed by exafs , 
 ftir , and other methods .
decoration of complex 2 at the bdt ligand with two carboxylates results in complex 1 which can be introduced into mofs by pse of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate 
 ( bdc ) ligands , which is a common ligand linker in many mofs ( figure 1 ) .
