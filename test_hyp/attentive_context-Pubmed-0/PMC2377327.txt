we performed a standard dti 
 experiment on 6 subjects and used the coordinates of the network nodes as seed 
 regions for a fiber tracking analysis . in this analysis ,
in this study , we have for the 
 first time used dti - based fiber tractography to investigate the anatomical 
 basis of effective connectivity models .  
we have established 
 whether dti - based fiber tractography provides evidence about the direct nature 
 of every possible connection , whether or not it was proposed in the original 
 studies .
in functional neuroimaging ,   and particularly in pet and fmri ,   study design and analysis have been dominated by the concept of   functional segregation , which emphasizes the specialization of a brain structure for a 
 specific part of a cognitive function .
first , we wanted to establish that dti - based tractography is able to resolve the 
 connectivity between rois of the size typically used in effective connectivity 
 studies .
we therefore conclude that dti - based 
 tractography is a valuable tool for exploring the anatomical basis of 
 functional networks .
we have 
 chosen networks spanning a number of different cognitive domains , including 
 learning   , 
 cognitive control   , working memory , visual and auditory perception , major depression , and the thalamocortical network 
 involved in general - anaesthetic - induced unconsciousness .
