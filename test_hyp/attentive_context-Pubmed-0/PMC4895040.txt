the purpose of the present study is to assess the aqueous outflow system in patients affected by primary open angle glaucoma ( poag ) undergoing canaloplasty , using a flexible microcatheter filled with indocyanine green ( icg ) diluted in viscoelastic solution .
contrarily , they could be lymphatic new vessels , whose development might be promoted by the increase in iris hydrostatic pressure secondary to poag . in conclusion , this study shows that the use of icg coupled with viscoelastic solution , injected through the sc , is a useful tool to detect site of resistance in the outflow pathway .
herein we showed that injection of a mixture composed of icg and viscoelastic solution into the sc allows clear visualization of the portions of the conventional outflow pathway in patients affected by poag .
research is ongoing to find a dye formulation that might be topically applied to visualize conventional ah outflow pathway in a noninvasive fashion .
, the filling seemed to be influenced by the resistance encountered by the dye to progress ; in fact , after increasing the volume / pressure of infusion , visualization of some ccs , initially not perfused , occurred .
