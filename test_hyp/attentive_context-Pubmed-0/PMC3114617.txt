a 35-year - old man presented to our hospital with a 3-month history of a painless left testicular mass .
the diagnosis of a malignant leydig cell tumour is not always easy since no definite histological criteria for malignancy exist .
leydig cell tumours are rare stromal tumours of the testis accounting for 13% of testicular neoplasms .
they exhibit a peak incidence in the preadolescent as well as in the older ( > 50 years ) age groups   .
leydig cell tumours are rare and only about 3% of them are bilateral . about 1520% of the patients already present with metastatic disease , particularly in the lymph nodes , lung and liver
a left radical orchidectomy was performed and the specimen submitted for histopathological examination . on microscopic examination , a malignant leydig cell tumour was found .
many cells with large atypical pleomorphic nuclei could also be observed ( fig . 1 , fig .
microscopic features such as the severe nuclear atypia and increased mitotic activity ( > 3/10 hpf ) favoured the diagnosis of malignancy . however , there was no angiolymphatic invasion or extension beyond the capsule of the testis . also , the small size of the tumour was remarkable .
