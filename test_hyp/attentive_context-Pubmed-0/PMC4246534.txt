oamd organisational 
 factors reveal the need for local and collective management of this risk and the importance 
 of a better understanding of movement / displacement performed under working situations , i.e. 
 in a context integrating specific task requirements and working conditions .
this paper describes initially the need for , and limits involved in , neutralising the 
 environmental factors in play and subsequently the production - safety arbitrations prompted 
 by the so - called  organisational  oamd factors referred to in the 
 literature .
despite scientific progress in the safety field , oamds are still commonly considered 
  simple  accidents resulting from a malfunction in a  simple  system ; this might suggest 
 that their prevention is also 
these observations provide a partial 
 explanation for worker difficulties in systematically applying certain recommendations based 
 on common sense ( e.g.  do nt rush  ) that are aimed at preventing oamds .
research into these accidents shows that , as in all occupational accidents , many 
 accident - causing event configurations stem from arbitration between production and safety , 
 which can not be overlooked if progress is to be achieved in the prevention field . 

awareness of the oamd risk , in particular , is an essential prerequisite to any progress in 
 preventing these accidents .
