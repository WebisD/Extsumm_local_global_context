a secondary aim of the study was to assess rt frequency - related changes in skeletal muscle mass .
the remaining 64 older women ( 60 years old ) were randomly assigned to one of two groups : a group that performed rt two times per week ( n=32 ; group 
a significant main effect for group - by - time interaction ( f=2.53 , p<0.05 ) was observed , in which g3x showed a higher increase than g2x ( g2x=+87.8% , es=7.31 ; g3x=+92.2% , es=10.39 ) .
the results of our study suggest that 12 weeks of rt improves or at least preserves the flexibility of different joint movements in older women . in addition
our findings indicate that rt performed at a minimum of twice per week can result in positive effects on flexibility in the elderly , reversing or slowing the aging - induced losses .
the ess for skeletal muscle mass changes were 0.21 and 0.43 for twice and thrice per week sessions , respectively .
