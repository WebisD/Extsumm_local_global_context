the development of optogenetics has provided researchers with a powerful set of tools to manipulate neural activity in genetically defined populations of cells in a pathway - specific manner.9 in applying optogenetic strategies to established animal models of psychiatric disease , investigators have made rapid progress in defining the neural circuitry responsible for both psychiatric disease and symptom relief .
the unclear neuronal substrates of psychiatric diseases and correspondingly slow progress of novel drug development have resulted in pharmaceutical companies recently abandoning development of psychiatric compounds.8 to reinvigorate research , it may be necessary to take a more refined technological approach to the study of disease symptoms and treatment .
a better understanding of the neurobiological processes that underlie psychiatric disease states is expected to help drug development efforts .
to this end , numerous animal models of psychiatric disease states have been developed.6 one approach to modeling psychiatric disease in an animal is to use a behavioral task in which an animal s performance is sensitive to drug treatments that have already proved to be effective in humans.7 when new drugs produce behavioral effects that are similar to those elicited with proven pharmacotherapies , they are likely to have similar mechanisms of action to the old drugs and be similarly effective in treating the disease .
