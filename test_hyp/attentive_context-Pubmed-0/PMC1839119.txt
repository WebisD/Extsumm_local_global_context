nd , not determined or unknown . genes that are differentially expressed in favorable vs unfavorable neuroblastoma genes that are differentially expressed compared with neuroblasts among the differentially expressed genes in favorable neuroblastoma ( nb ) vs unfavorable nb , with an indication of the number of neuroblastoma microarray studies in which these genes were found through nbgs analysis .
as this error leads to an incorrect subclassification of the patients into the ' favourable ' and ' unfavourable ' neuroblastoma subgroups , we would like to exclude this data point from the differential expression analysis of favorable versus unfavorable neuroblastoma given under the heading ' differential expression analysis of favorable and unfavorable neuroblastoma ' in the results section of .
careful reanalysis after exclusion of nb11 did not lead to important changes in the generated gene lists and conclusions ; the changes are given in the corrected paragraph and table 2 ( a corrected version of table 4 ) , and the additional data files 1 and 2 ( corrected versions of additional data files 2 and 3 ) available online with this article . we also noticed that sample nb1 is stage 1 instead of stage 4s and that sample nb2 was not localized to the adrenals ( see table 1 ) .
