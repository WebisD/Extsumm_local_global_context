hence , this article emphasizes on detailed dentoalveolar examination and early diagnosis for finding the primary focus of metastatic tumor .
a 60-year - old male patient presented with a swelling in the right lower back teeth region of the jaw since 3 months [ figure 1 ] .
nearly , 90% of metastatic tumors occur in jaw bones , especially premolar - molar region of the mandible , whereas metastases to soft tissues are extraordinarily rare and account for 0.1% of all oral malignancies .
the common primary sources of tumors metastatic to the oral region are the breast , lung and kidney .
oral metastatic tumors are found to be the first sign of metastatic spread and in some instances ; they are an indication for unidentified primary tumor of the distant site .
the actual incidence of these cancers is unknown since oral metastatic disease is usually a manifestation of advanced disease .
the primary site differs according to oral site colonization . in men , primary tumor of the lung followed by the prostate gland and kidney
the lesion was diagnosed as a metastatic malignant tumor , probably metastasizing from the lung .
metastasis to the soft tissues mostly involves gingiva and alveolar mucosal sites ( 54% ) followed by tongue ( 30% ) . in some cases ,
