we will also examine the usefulness of physiological stimuli to studying the regulation of satellite cell activation and muscle regeneration .
we will discuss the current knowledge on satellite cell regulation as well as the recent developments of the importance of notch and wnt signaling to muscle repair .
this review will summarize the literature to address the interest on the effects of physiological stimuli on notch and wnt signaling pathways during postnatal myogenesis .
furthermore , we will enlighten the reader with what is currently known on the effects of physiological stimuli and muscle repair as relates to notch and wnt signaling .
since the identification of satellite cells on skeletal muscle fibers in 19611 , the field of satellite cell biology has progressed immensely to its recent characterization as an adult stem cell and its implications in regenerative medicine .
employing a variety of muscle injury and growth techniques will result in a definitive understanding of satellite cell contribution to muscle repair and hypertrophy . with its systemic effects ,
therefore , understanding the intrinsic and systemic response of contracting muscle will aid in deciphering the regulation of satellite cells and muscle repair as well as understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial protective effects of exercise to cardiovascular disease and cancer .
