ongoing monitoring of spraying operations is essential to assure optimal programme performance and early corrective action , where indicated .
the computerised management system allowed malaria programme management and field supervisors to monitor spraying coverage , insecticide consumption and application rates on an ongoing basis .
malaria control programmes utilising indoor residual spraying are only effective if a high coverage of targeted structures is achieved and an insecticide that is effective against the specific mosquito vector is correctly applied .
the system supported a successful transition to community - based spraying , while assuring correct insecticide application and spraying completion according to schedule .
the structure and components of this computerised management system are described , and its ' operational benefit in southern mozambique , where community - based spray operators apply intradomiciliary insecticide , are reviewed .
successful development and application of a computerised spraying operations management system in mpumalanga province , south africa during 1998 resulted in its adaptation and introduction in neighbouring maputo province , southern mozambique during 2000 .
the ongoing monitoring of individual spray operator 's productivity , in terms of number of structures sprayed each day and volume of insecticide sprayed per structure , has facilitated early detection of operational problems , leading to prompt investigation and supportive corrective action by supervisors .
