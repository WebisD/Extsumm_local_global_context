, we evaluate trends in resident surgical experience with core ophthalmic procedures from 2009 to 2015 by reviewing the acgme resident case logs .
acgme resident surgical case logs on cataract , cornea , retina , glaucoma , pediatrics , plastics , and trauma procedures published from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed for year - to - year trends in the average number of cases performed as primary surgeon.15 the yale university institutional review board ( irb)/ethics committee ruled that irb approval was not required for this study as it did not involve human subjects .
from 2009 to 2015 , the average number of residency programs per year was 166.3 , and the total number of residents was 2,797 for all 6 years . during this 6-year period ,
, cataract surgery has continued to evolve , with smaller incision procedures , development of premium intraocular lenses and laser - assisted surgery.13 in the field of retina , anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti - vegf ) intravitreal injections have revolutionized treatment of macular edema and choroidal neovascularization.46 the field of glaucoma has experienced a new wave of therapeutic tools , with the development of microinvasive glaucoma surgery such as trabeculectomy ab interno and trabecular meshwork bypass shunts.7,8 in the cornea subspecialty , advances in partial thickness corneal transplant surgeries have transformed the field.9 all of these unique therapies continue to advance ophthalmology and offer hope for improved visual rehabilitation in various conditions . while expanding the array of therapeutic tools , these advances also challenge medical educators with the task of training residents with these new skills and in traditional management approaches .
