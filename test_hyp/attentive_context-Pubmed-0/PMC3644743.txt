the aim of this study was to demonstrate whether there is any difference between two group of patients with coronary atherosclerotic plaque and subjects without coronary atherosclerosis for the presence of c. pneumoniae dna by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method .
comparisons between patients with coronary atherosclerosis and controls for weight , height and body mass index the frequency of atherosclerotic plaques in different vessels of the heart in the study group positive pcr result for c. pneumonia was seen in one ( 3.3% ) sample among the 30 coronary artery tissues with atherosclerosis ( advanced plaque ) , while all the control samples were negative .
fisher 's exact test showed no significant difference for detection of c. pneumoniae between samples of coronary artery with and without atherosclerotic plaque ( p = 1 ) .
was seen in five patients ( 16.7% ) , one vessel with advanced plaque was observed in three patients ( 10.0% ) , seven patients ( 23.3% ) had one vessel with fibro - fatty and one vessel with advanced plaque , two vessels with advanced plaque were noticed in six patients ( 20.0% ) , three vessels with advanced plaque were observed in five patients ( 16.7% ) and four patients ( 13.3% ) had two vessels with advanced plaque and one fibro - fatty morphology .
