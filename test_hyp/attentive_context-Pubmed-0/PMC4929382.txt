we report the case of a relapsing para - oesophageal abscess posing a great diagnostic challenge .
crohn 's disease ( cd ) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastro - intestinal tract   ; its exact aetiology and pathogenesis is not known .
diagnosis of isolated oesophageal cd can be challenging   , since clinical findings often are non - specific .
the diagnosis has to be made by integration of symptoms as well as endoscopic , histologic , and serologic findings   .
other , more frequent diseases ( e.g. , malignancy , eosinophilic oesophagitis , and viral or fungal infections ) must be ruled out .
a 42-year - old male patient with a para - oesophageal abscess and a fistula into the distal oesophagus was referred to our gastroenterology department in september 2012 for further evaluation and treatment .
current models of pathogenesis include interactions between genetic factors , environmental factors , and the intestinal flora which lead to dysregulation of the immune response and to inflammation of the wall of the gastro - intestinal tube   .
however , isolated oesophageal cd is a very rare condition   . the clinical presentation and endoscopic and histologic findings of oesophageal cd are mostly non - specific and share features of more common diseases of the oesophagus .
