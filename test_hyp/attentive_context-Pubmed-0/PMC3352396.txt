arthropod ) ? the majority of medical scientists , when asked this question , will offer the following explanations ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) : ( i ) hiv concentrations in the blood are too low during human infection to permit vector transmission ; ( ii ) hiv is unable to survive long enough outside of humans ( or primates ) for vector transmission ; ( iii ) hiv is not able to replicate within arthropod vectors .
( iii ) why has hiv not evolved the ability to replicate in arthropod vectors ?
more to the point , if there are conditions under which hiv could have evolved vector transmission we would do well to understand these , not only from the standpoint of scientific curiosity , but also to prevent such an outcome in the future . in this article , we address the question of why hiv lacks vector transmission , both through a consideration of available empirical data and through the construction of mathematical models . although our results are necessarily speculative , we believe that they shed some light on the evolutionary biology of hiv , and on the evolutionary biology of blood - borne pathogens more generally .
