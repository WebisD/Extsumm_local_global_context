however , the heterogeneity of the protocols and devices evaluated made the 
 interpretation of the results difficult . therefore , the aim of this study was to : 1 ) assess 
 the validity of hhd vs. isokinetic dynamometry in the evaluation of knee extensor and flexor 
 muscle strength , 2 ) establish the reproducibility of hhd measurements of knee extensor and 
 flexor muscle strength , and 3 ) compare the flexor / extensor ratios obtained with the 2 
 methods .
knee extensor and flexor muscle strength 
 recorded with an hhd is reproducible and significantly correlated with the isokinetic 
 values , indicating that this method may in some cases be a useful replacement for isokinetic 
 strength measurement , even for the assessment of strong muscles .
greater limits of agreement were previously observed for reproducibility of muscle strength 
 using hhd in strong muscle groups ( i.e. , knee extensors ) compared to weaker muscle groups 
 ( i.e. , knee or elbow flexors)34 . 

the results of the present study show : 1 ) good reproducibility of the hhd for knee 
 extensor / flexor muscle strength assessment , 2 ) clinically acceptable agreement between the 
 values obtained with the hhd versus the isokinetic dynamometer , and 3 ) the need for caution 
 when interpreting the flexor / extensor ratios using hhd compared to isokinetic 
 dynamometry . the muscle strength values using isokinetic dynamometry recorded in this study are in good 
 agreement with those found in the literature31 , particularly in the study by maffiuleti et al . in 200723 . for a similar population of healthy 
 individuals ( age : 30  5 vs. 33  11  years old ; height : 175  8 vs. 17710  cm ; weight : 70  
 13 vs. 74  16  kg ) , the strength measurements using the con - trex isokinetic module were very 
 close , with a peak torque for the knee extensors on the dominant side of 178  46 vs. 179  
 52 nm ( concentric at 60/s ) ; 132  38 vs. 132  39 nm ( concentric 180/s ) , and 202  68 vs. 
 202  62 nm ( eccentric 60/s ) when compared with our values . similarly , the muscle strength values recorded with the hhd are in agreement , albeit with 
 greater absolute data , with literature data32 , 33 and with the recent study by douma et al . , 
 who established reference values for knee extensor and flexor muscle strength in the active 
 dutch population by using the microfet 2 hhd34 .
