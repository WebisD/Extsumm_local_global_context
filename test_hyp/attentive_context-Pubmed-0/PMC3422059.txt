so , the purpose of this study was to compare shear bond strength ( sbs ) of orthodontic brackets bonded to enamel prepared by er : yag laser with two different powers and conventional acid - etching .
the shear bond strength of bracket to laser - prepared enamel with two different powers of 1 and 1.5 w was similar and laser groups showed higher bond strengths than the acid etch group .
the mean and standard deviation of the conventional acid - etch group , laser group ( 1w ) and laser group ( 1.5w ) was 3.82  1.16 , 6.97  3.64 and 6.93  4.87 , respectively .
the teeth were divided into three groups according to conditioning method : group 1 : conventional etching with 37% phosphoric acid ; group 2 : laser irradiation by er : yag laser with output power of 1w ; and finally group 3 : laser irradiation with er : yag laser with output power of 1.5w . in group 1 ,
there was no significant difference between laser group ( 1.5w ) and laser group ( 1w ) ( p=1.000 ) and conventional group ( p=0.085 ) , but there was a significant difference between laser group ( 1w ) and conventional group ( p=0.016 ) . according to graph 1 , the variances of values of the laser samples bond strengths was higher than the acid - etch group .
