. it can be difficult to separate the two and even endoscopic ultrasound can be non - diagnostic and adequate histology sampling may require a resection ( 3 ) . where a biopsy diagnosis has been made endoscopic resection or limited resection can be undertaken removing the need for major resectional surgery ( 3 ) .
ct scan of the abdomen showing the lesion ( marked a ) a laparoscopic extended right hemicolectomy was performed under general anaesthesia .
lipohypertrophy of the ileo - caecal valve is classified as a variant of normal ( 1 ) . the vast majority are asymptomatic but they can manifest due to intussusceptions , ulceration leading to haemorrhage or iron deficiency anaemia , intestinal obstruction or present as an abdominal mass . most are compressible and submucosal although they can rarely develop in the serosa and appear as a fold or polyp .
