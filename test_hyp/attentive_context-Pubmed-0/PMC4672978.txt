our case shows that early surgical reconstruction is reasonable , regardless of the symptoms , in cases of isolation of the left subclavian artery .
a girl weighing 3,190 g was delivered by a caesarean section at 38 weeks and five days of gestation . at the time of birth , a systolic murmur
was noted during a physical examination , and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a peri - membranous ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) with a septal aneurysm , a small patent foramen ovale ( pfo ) , and a small right - sided patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) from the innominate artery .
since surgical reconstruction of the isolated left subclavian artery leads to antegrade flow in the left subclavian artery , it can prevent hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery and subclavian / pulmonary steal syndrome .
a subsequent computed tomographic scan demonstrated isolation of the left subclavian artery with a right aortic arch , a left pda , and a vsd ( fig .
the intraoperative findings were a perimembranous vsd , a pfo , a mildly patent right ductus arteriosus , and isolation of the left subclavian artery connected to the left pulmonary artery via a left pda .
