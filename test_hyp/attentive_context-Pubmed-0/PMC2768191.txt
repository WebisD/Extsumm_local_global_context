the most striking difference concerned the treatment of diabetes , which was strongly related to process indicators ; for all of the assessments considered , their frequency was lowest among patients receiving diet - only treatment and highest among those treated with insulin ( table 1 ) .
the effect of age differed between measures ; a1c and cholesterol assessments increased with age up to the 65- to 74-year age class and decreased in the 75-year age - group .
as for clinical variables , individuals with established cvd had a lower frequency for all indicators , with the exception of ecg .
our findings suggest that care provided to patients with diabetes can be improved by increasing the intensity of disease management programs to foster greater participation by general practitioners , thus increasing knowledge and decision support and raising appropriateness .
the study base included all residents in the city of torino ( 900,000 inhabitants ) , aged 20 years , with a diagnosis of diabetes , and alive as at 31 july 2003 .
on the basis of this set of indicators , the present study shows that there are considerable opportunities for improving the management of diabetes , particularly in elderly patients and in those with less severe forms of the disease .
