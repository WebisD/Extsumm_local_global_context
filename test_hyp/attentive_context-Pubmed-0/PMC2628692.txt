in a managed care plan with a large number of women with gdm pregnancies , we found that between 1995 and 2006 , screening for postpartum diabetes increased from 20.7 to 53.8% .
the increase in screening performance is not likely to be due to advancing maternal age or changes in the racial / ethnic composition of women with gdm , as this trend in screening performance was similar after adjustment for age and race / ethnicity , and almost the entire population of pregnant women was screened for gdm between 1995 and 2006 . although the proportion of women with ifg on their postpartum screen did not significantly change over time , the proportion of women with diabetes ( diagnosed by fpg levels ) at postpartum decreased by 50% .
564 were screened at postpartum , and 131 had ifg and 32 had diabetes by fpg ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates 24.2 [ 95% ci 20.27.8 ] and 6.1   , respectively ) . among women who delivered in 20042006 , 2,381 women were screened , and 583 had ifg and 80 had diabetes by fpg ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates 24.3   and 3.3   , respectively ) .
