a statistically significant increase was observed in the kinesio group , 
 when compared to control group after 24 and 48 hours of taping for the right hand , and after 
 48 hours of taping for the left hand . between the kinesio and kwt groups ,
the human hand is clearly the most 
 important and complex structure of the upper extremity due to its extensive mobility and the 
 sensitive capabilities of its surrounding tissues , which allows gripping and feeling , its 
 essential functions2 , 12 due to the increasing utilization of kinesio tape in clinical settings , studies are 
 necessary to confirm the purported benefits of the method and establish evidence - based 
 standards for this technique . in light of the scarcity of research regarding kinesio taping , 
 and the fundamental role of handgrip strength in activities of daily living , this study 
 assessed the effects of kinesio taping on the handgrip strength of healthy women , as 
 measured by handgrip dynamometry .
this study recruited 75 healthy women volunteers , aged between 18 and 30  years , who were 
 randomly subdivided into three groups ( n=25 ) : kinesio , kinesio without tension ( kwt ) , and 
 the control groups .
