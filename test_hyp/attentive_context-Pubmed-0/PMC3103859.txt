the simplicity , rapidity , and inexpensiveness of the proposed method in combination with the use of dithizone as a chromogenic reagent were utilized for selenium determination in cosmetic and pharmaceutical samples .
spectrophotometric determination of selenium was carried out in micellar medium without the need for an extraction step .
because of the overlapping of absorption maximum of complex at 424  nm with absorption maximum of dithizone at 434  nm , a 
 corr was applied .
the aim of this work was to use a simple , rapid , and sensitive spectrophotometric method ( dithizone as chromogenic reagent ) for determination of trace amounts of selenium ( iv ) ( 5100  ng  ml ) in micellar medium ( triton x-100 ) in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products . to improve
precision and recovery data clearly indicated the reproducibility and accuracy of the method . in this investigation ,
the method was applied to the determination of selenium in two multivitamin tablets ( centrum and selen plus ) and a selenium sulphide shampoo ( for treatment of dandruff ) .
the results for selenium sulphide shampoo , centrum , and selen plus multivitamins are given in tables 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively .   in order to evaluate the accuracy of procedure
