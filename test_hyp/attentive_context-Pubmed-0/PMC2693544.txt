here we report results from a hospital based case - control study examining the association of il1b -511 c > t polymorphisms with the risk of cervical cancer .
here we reported that -511 polymorphism in il1b gene was associated with the risk of cervical cancer .
the ct genotype was associated with significantly elevated or of 2.83 ( 95% ci=1.52 to 5.28 , p<0.001 ) .
when we combined ct and tt genotypes together , we found that ct and tt genotypes were associated with or of 2.42 ( 95% ci=1.31 to 4.46 , p<0.005 ) .
our findings in this hospital - based case - control study suggest that the carriers of -511 t allele may be at increased risk of developing cervical cancer .
we found that carriers of the t allele had a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer .
also , the tt genotype was associated with elevated or of 1.68 ( 95% ci=0.85 to 3.32 , p=0.136 ) .
in korean population , we observed that the allelic frequencies of the 182 case subjects ( c , 0.42 ; t , 0.58 ) were not significantly different from those of the 364 control subjects ( c , 0.43 ; t , 0.57 ) .
