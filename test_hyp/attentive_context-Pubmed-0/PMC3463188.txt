contrary to our hypothesis , after 12 weeks of exercise training , absolute walking time and time to reach nadir muscle tissue oxygenation were prolonged in the patients assigned to the traditional walking program more than those assigned to a walking - with - poles exercise training program reflecting greater tissue perfusion and enhancement of arteriovenous oxygen extraction .
  there are three major findings of this study : ( 1 ) the time elapsed before reaching nadir sto2 values is associated with initial claudication time and absolute walking time , ( 2 ) there was no difference in the time associated with the nadir of sto2 and the onset of claudication pain , and ( 3 ) the time to nadir sto2 of the gastrocnemius muscle was greater after 12 weeks of exercise training in the traditional walking group when compared to the walking with poles group .    as bauer notes , during higher work rates and apparent blood flow limitation , muscle oxygen desaturation becomes more rapid in pad subjects .
wang and colleagues recently demonstrated in 17 subjects with pad who completed a 24-week walking program that an increase in the number of capillaries in contact with type iix and iia calf muscle fibers was related to an improved pain - free walking time ( r = .69 and r = .62 , p < .05 ) .
