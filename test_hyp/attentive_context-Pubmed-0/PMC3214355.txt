postoperative arf was more prevalent in older and male patients ( p = 0.003 and 0.002 , respectively ) , and those with a higher history of hypertension(p = 0.012 ) , but prevalence of other risk factors as well as left ventricular ejection fraction were similar in both group of patients .
combined coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) and valve surgery was the strongest predictor of postoperative arf ( or : 4.976 , p = 0.002 ) , followed by intra - aortic balloon pump insertion ( or : 6.890 , p = 0.009 ) and higher dose of contrast agent ( or : 1.446 , p = 0.031 ) .
however , the time interval between cardiac surgery and last catheterization was not different between the patients with and without arf ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . clinical and demographic characteristics of the studied population contrast agent and cardiac surgery data overall postoperative peak creatinine was highest on day 0 ( figure 2 ) , then decreased and remained significantly unchanged after this period ( p < 0.05 ) .
mean dose of hyperosmolar and low - osmolar contrast agents used overall were 1.23 and 1.21 ml / kg , respectively .
