we investigated the predictive preoperative factors for renal insufficiency following radical nephrectomy by focusing on the association between the measured parenchymal volume of the unaffected and the affected kidneys before radical nephrectomy and the postoperative estimated gfr ( egfr ) in rcc patients .
with control for bmi , urine albumin , and serum uric acid , the parenchymal volume of the remnant kidney ( odds ratio [ or ] , 9.185 ; p=0.001 ) , a history of diabetes ( or , 20.129 ; p=0.035 ) , and preoperative egfr ( or , 0.929 ; p=0.011 ) showed an association with renal insufficiency . because egfr 5 years after radical nephrectomy was found to correlate with the parenchymal volume of the remnant kidney , an roc curve was plotted by using data from group a and group b ( fig .
the median age of the patients was 61 years ( range , 53 to 68 years ) in group a and 48 years ( range , 42 to 57 years ) in group b. the median parenchymal volume of the remnant kidney was 156.28 ml in group a and 181.82 ml in group b. median age ( 61.0 years vs. 48.0 years , p<0.001 ) , preoperative egfr ( 73.97 vs. 83.95 , p<0.001 ) , serum uric acid level ( 5.5 vs. 4.3 , p=0.011 ) , and parenchymal volume of the remnant kidney ( 156.28 vs. 181.92 , p=0.003 ) were significantly different between groups a and b. table 3 shows the results of the univariate and multivariate binary regression analysis to identify the predictive factors for renal sufficiency ( an egfr less than 60 ml / min/1.73 m ) 5 years after radical nephrectomy .
