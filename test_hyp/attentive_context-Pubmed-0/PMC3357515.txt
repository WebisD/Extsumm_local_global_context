the hemobile was further used in testing tubular structures made of various polymers to show its effectiveness in determination of hemocompatibility by means of in vitro circulation of human blood .
nevertheless , all the other elements depicting the blood - graft phase boundary scene are present , while the use of human blood from one donor in test and control circuits is a major advantage for comparison of the materials .
the hemobile model was compared with the chandler loop and roller pump model for intrinsic damage to blood components and activation of platelets .
platelet binding based on the adhesion of antibody against the platelet gpiib receptor showed increased values on pet , whereas dyneema purity uhmwpe fiber had lowest gpiib receptors ( figure 4 ) . in the eptfe circuits ,
platelet count was reduced in the circuits containing a test chamber with eptfe , pet , or dyneema purity uhmwpe fiber by approximately 30% following circulation compared to baseline .
the adjustable flow and shear and the pulsatility in the hemobile renders it in a model that allows standardised testing of these devices at the cost of low intrinsic blood damage , while closely mimicking the in vivo conditions .
