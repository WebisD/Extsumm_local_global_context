to assess the performance of the endopat , we investigated the variability of endothelial function ( rhi ) and arterial stiffness ( ai ) in patients with chronic kidney failure on three different days , separated by one to two weeks .
in addition , we measured endothelial function and arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 , another patient population with a strongly reduced endothelial reactivity as determined using conventional techniques ( 3035% reduction )   . finally , we investigated the capability of the device to detect changes in endothelial function induced by two acute and robust interventions ( smoking and glucose administration ) in healthy volunteers .
for the smoking intervention , the difference in rhi from baseline measurement was 0.49    0.92 ( 95% ci : from 0.47 to 1.46 ) for the 30  min assessment and 0.39  0.53 ( 95% ci : from 0.16 to 0.95 ) for the 90  min assessment .
for the glucose intervention , the difference in rhi from baseline measurement was 0.08  0.50 ( 95% ci , confidence interval : from 0.44 to 0.60 ) for the 30  min assessment and 0.44  0.86 ( 95% ci : from 0.46 to 1.34 ) for the 90  min assessment .
