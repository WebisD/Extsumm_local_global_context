n. by owing its ambiguous 
 diagnosis , its similarity with a. parupenei and due to the broader 
 spectrum of morphological features which this genus includes . on the other hand , 
 p. genypteri
is provisionally retained in 
 pseudascarophis , based on the criteria of muoz and george - nascimento ( 2001 ) for separating it from 
 ascarophis and by the presence of digitiform buccal processes , 
 until new evidence can help to clarify its generic status .
p. genypteri was considered different from 
 ascarophis by two characteristics , i.e. , their pseudolabia 
 appear to be rounded , instead of being conical as in ascarophis and 
 the anterior third is thicker than the rest of the body .
p. genypteri was 
 distinguished from p. kyphosi because it has larger spicules , 
 rounded pseudolabia that join in the middle of the oral opening , eight digitiform 
 buccal processes , unfilamented eggs and four pairs of preanal and five pairs of 
 postanal papillae , the same set of differences allow distinguishing it from the new 
 species .
the other species , p. genypteri , a parasite of 
 genypterus chilensis ( guichenot ) ( ophidiidae ) from chile ( 
 muoz & george - nascimento 2001 ) , was 
 originally assigned to this genus by lacking cephalic papillae , submedial and medial 
 labia , as well as because of the progressive prominence of cuticular striations from 
 anterior to posterior body regions and by having the anterior third of body wider 
 than the posterior region . at specific level ,
