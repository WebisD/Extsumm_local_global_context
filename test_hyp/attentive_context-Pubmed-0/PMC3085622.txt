herein , we present our early experiences of robotic partial nephrectomy ( rpn ) procedures performed at our institution and compare the operative outcomes of rpn with those of lpn .
between february 2009 and june 2010 , 13 patients underwent transperitoneal rpn ( group 1 ) and 14 patients underwent transperitoneal lpn ( group 2 ) by a single surgeon .
our experiences showed that rpn was technically feasible , and its operative outcomes were comparable to those of lpn . although the operative time of rpn was longer than that of lpn , there was no significant difference in operative outcomes , including robotic console time and laparoscopic time . to identify advantages of rpn , we must accumulate more experience and make further technical developments . further studies with long - term follow - up of rpn are also needed to make rpn a standard treatment for localized rcc .
pathologic results showed 11 cases of rcc and 2 cases of aml in group 1 , and 9 cases of rcc , cases of aml , and 1 case of oncocytoma in group 2 ( p=0.785 ) .
the mean times to postoperative initiation of ambulation were 1.20.4 days and 1.20.4 days ( p=0.920 ) , and the times to initiation of oral intake were 1.20.4 days and 1.10.3 days ( p=0.504 ) in groups 1 and 2 , respectively .
