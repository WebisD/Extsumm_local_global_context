study in which 37% of the global warming simulated from a doubling of atmospheric co2 was due explicitly to the inclusion of sea ice in the calculations .
several studies have examined the related issue of the length of the melt season and in doing so have tackled the problem of determining dates of melt onset and freezeup [ smith , 1998 ; belchansky et al .
gives a pure accounting of the portion of the year with a reflective , insulating ice cover present and has resulted in trend maps that show a high degree of spatial coherence , with almost no speckling . throughout the entire grid ,
both the autumn onset of ice coverage and the spring / summer disappearance of ice can involve multiple appearances and disappearances , some quite transitory . simply counting the days of ice coverage
this paper examines changes in the length of the sea ice season over the period 19792013 , showing a large predominance of shortening versus lengthening ice seasons ( figure  2 ) .
in fact , considerable evidence has been compiled to link changes in the arctic to consequent changes in weather conditions at lower latitudes [ e.g. , francis and vavrus , 2012 ; vihma , 2014 ] , and conversely , changes in lower latitudes have been viewed as forcings on recent arctic warming [ ding et al . ,
