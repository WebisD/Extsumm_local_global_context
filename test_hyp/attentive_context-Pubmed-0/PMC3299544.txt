chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) is a progressive obstructive airways disease with incomplete improvement in lung function in response to therapy .
indacaterol is the first once - daily long - acting 2-selective agent , sometimes referred to as an ultra - laba , indicated for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate to severe copd , has been approved in more than 40 countries ( including throughout the european union ) at a recommended dose of 150 g once daily and a maximum dose of 300 g once daily,8 and has been shown to be effective and well tolerated by subjects with copd during 12 weeks of treatment.9 with any new treatment intended for long - term use , it is important to evaluate safety and to determine if efficacy remains unblunted with regular use . a thorough characterization of safety is particularly relevant for a long - acting bronchodilator , given the recent interest in the safety of these agents in the treatment of copd.10 the 75 g dose of indacaterol as licensed in the us was evaluated only in studies of 12 weeks duration.11 overall , the results with indacaterol 150 g and 300 g demonstrate a good profile of safety and tolerability that is comparable with the other evaluated long - acting bronchodilators . compared with these two doses , results with the 75 g dose of indacaterol were occasionally anomalous but must be considered in the context that these data are less robust in terms of shorter length of treatment ( maximum 12 weeks ) and fewer patients exposed to this dose.12 however , in the two studies evaluating the 75 g dose , the safety and tolerability profiles were similar to placebo.11 few deaths occurred in any of the active treatment groups , and the number of deaths adjusted per patient - year was not increased with any of the laba treatments relative to placebo .
