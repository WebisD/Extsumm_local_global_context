the present findings may help to understand the molecular network of inflammations and apoptosis in flss and offer novel insights into the clinical improving of ra therapy .
in conclusion , the results of this study support the notion that lipid peroxidation - mediated inflammation promotes cell apoptosis through activation of nf-b pathway in rheumatoid arthritis synovial cells .
thus , we screened and identified the inflammation alternations by 4-hydroxynonenal ( 4-hne ) treatment in mh7a cells , a human rheumatoid arthritis synovial cell line
we demonstrate that products of lipid peroxidations , 4-hne , could induce synovial intrinsic inflammations by activating nf-b pathways and lead to cell apoptosis .
our results imply that blocking nf-b activation may be partly beneficial for human ra therapy .
since nf-b is a master regulator of inflammatory responses , we would like to test whether inhibition of nf-b activation could reduce inflammations and subsequent cell apoptosis in mh7a cells .
it is noted that , after 4-hne treatment , inflammation relative pathways , such as nf-b and stats , were significantly upregulated ( figure 1 ) , while the cell growth or survival relative pathways , such as insulin receptor ( ir ) , akt , mtor , and gsk pathways , were downregulated ( figure 1 ) . these results are consistent with the previous findings , indicating that lipid peroxidation is able to induce cell stress to promote inflammations and inhibit cell growth . as for the ectopic upregulation of inflammations by 4-hne treatment , we determine to identify the subsequent inflammation alternations and cell viability in mh7a synoviocytes . to further confirm the inflammation inductions by 4-hne treatment , we next examined the expressions of canonical inflammation factors , including il1- , il-6 , and tnf- .
