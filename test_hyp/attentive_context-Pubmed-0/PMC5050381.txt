, we summarize the available data for noise - induced damage and repair around ihc  sgn synapses and discuss the evidence for the contributions of cochlear malfunction and central plasticity to nihhl .
noise - induced hidden hearing loss ( nihhl ) refers to any functional impairment seen in subjects with noise exposing history but no permanent threshold shift ( pts ) .
this is different from the conventional definition of noise - induced hearing loss ( nihl ) , which is based on changes in auditory sensitivity or threshold shift .
this reduction has been found in both animals   and human subjects with a history of noise exposure but with normal audiograms . since the thresholds of the auditory nerve remain unchanged , the function relating compound action potentials ( cap ) amplitude with sound levels in nihhl animal is different from that in animals with threshold changes .
furthermore , the synaptopathy in nihhl is likely to be related to the synaptic repair after initial damage by noise , rather than a simple initial loss . in addition , the functional deficits seen in nihhl may also involve the contribution from central auditory plasticity   . in this review
