in conclusion , herein we provide evidence that the a1180v is a potential cause for dcm rather than a common variant in han chinese , although additional genetic or environmental factors may potentiate the risk for dcm in a1180v carriers .
we have presented the followup and sequencing data identifying that a1180v of scn5a was a potential risk factor for dcm , and it is absent among healthy han chinese . compared with the former results in 2008 , 5 a1180v carriers exhibited age - related progressive avb and dcm , and the a1180v carrier frequency among han chinese in our study is 0% out of 660 control cases .
dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) is the most common form of primary cardiomyopathy and is a leading cause for heart transplantations   approximately 30%50% of affected individuals have a familial form of dcm . to date
the combined carrier frequency , 0% ( i.e. , 0 out of 660 cases ) , of a1180v from our studies remarkably suggests that a1180v is not a common variant among healthy chinese , and the data significantly differs from that in the dbsnp database ( p = 5.3  10 ) .
studies of transgenic mice may also provide a step to test the hypothesis and to explore the underlying mechanism .
