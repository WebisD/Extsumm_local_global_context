could provide great benefit to patients with type 1 diabetes . in this study , to evaluate the efficacy of insulin degludec as a basal insulin for basal - bolus regimen for japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who are treated with twice - daily basal insulin injection therapy , we investigated glycemic control , daily , and day - to - day variability in plasma glucose using continuous glucose monitoring before and after switching to once - daily insulin degludec injection in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes .
, our study demonstrated that glycemic control 12 weeks after switching to once - daily insulin degludec injection with 20% dose reduction was comparable to that in patients treated with twice - daily injection of basal insulin injections and that such switching did not change the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia recorded by cgm .
the averages of blood glucose and standard deviation ( sd ) through the daytime ( 0:0023:59 ) were 184.1  45.8 versus 189.6  52.7  mg / dl and 68.4  14.5 versus 66.5  17.1  mg / dl , respectively .
the mean basal insulin and total daily doses at 12 weeks after switching to insulin degludec were significantly reduced compared to the baseline ( 15.2  7.6 versus 11.6  6.9  u , p < 0.01 , and 40.0  17.3 versus 37.9  16.7  u , p < 0.01 , resp . ) whereas the bolus insulin dose did not significantly change after switching .
