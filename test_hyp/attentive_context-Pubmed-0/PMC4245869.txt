therefore , 
 the goal of this study was to evaluate , histomorphometrically , the healing of surgically 
 created intrabony defects in dogs treated with prp+bg .
the new bone area was 8.191.46 
 mm ( control group ) and 8.811.47 mm ( prp ) . although 
 the difference in the new bone area , no significant difference was found in the 
 linear parameter new bone , e.g. bone position : from the apical notch to the most 
 coronal extent of new bone ( 4.370.44 mm , 4.240.68 mm , 
 4.370.46 mm and 4.440.42 mm , for control group , bg , prp and prp+bg , 
 respectively ; p=0.85 ) . mean and standard deviation ( sd ) for the parameters evaluated after all the 
 treatments ( control , bg , prp and bg+prp ) .
note the remaining 
 particles of bg surrounded by new bone and connective tissue ( c and d ) .
in an in vitro study , 
 the application of growth factors found in prp ( tgf-1 and igf - i ) in cultures of 
 periodontal ligament cells , increased their mitotic activity and their capacity for 
 adhesion on the root fragments surface . the use of platelet 
 growth factors associated with cell therapy could be an alternative favoring the process 
 of periodontal regeneration .
