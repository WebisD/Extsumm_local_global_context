it has been suggested that a hard core of smokers will constitute an increasing proportion of copd patients who still smoke.23 the high quitting rates among subjects with both an established and a new diagnosis of copd in our study contradicts this pessimism .
the study supports pursuit of early diagnosis of copd and gives reasons for a more optimistic attitude among health workers when they discuss smoking cessation with their copd patients .
smoking cessation is crucial for a better prognosis in patients with coronary heart disease ( chd)13 and copd.2,4,5 acute heart attacks are associated with high smoking cessation rates . in patients with a first myocardial infarction ( mi ) in the 1970s,3 among whom
a new diagnosis of both chd and obstructive lung disease was significantly associated with smoking cessation when analyzed by logistic regression and also after adjusting for sex and education level in multivariable logistic regression analyses ( table 4 ) .
both men and women belonging to any of these diagnostic groups showed increased quitting rates , 54.9% vs 39.8% ( p=0.02 ) in men and 47.1% vs 32.7% ( p=0.009 ) in women .
copd patients reluctance to quit smoking may lead to a feeling of hopelessness among the doctors who treat them.13 our aim was to determine how the quitting rate in adults is influenced by getting a diagnosis of obstructive lung disease in the population - based troms study .
