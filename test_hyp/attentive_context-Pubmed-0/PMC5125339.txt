, we found autosomal dominant inheritance of a heterozygous mutation in acetylcholine receptor epsilon - subunit ( chrne ) gene .
the presence of r - cmap indicates a diagnosis of either sccms or acetylcholine esterase deficiency , which is caused by mutations in the acetylcholinesterase - associated collagen ( colq ) gene ; hence , the identification of gene mutations underlying sccms will be necessary for further differential diagnosis .
herein , we identified three patients with sccms from a chinese family who presented with muscle weakness during early or late childhood . in these patients
for sccms patients whose illness can be attributed to the same mutation as in this study , a decremented electromyographic response was observed on 2 to 3 hz of stimulation ; however , r - cmap was not found .
motor nerve conduction studies revealed a repetitive - compound muscle action potential ( r - cmap ) after a single stimulation in the median , ulnar , and peroneal nerves in affected patients from the pedigree [ figure 2a2c ] , which even included the asymptomatic 4-year - old girl although she did not complain of weakness or fatigue [ figure 2d ] .
