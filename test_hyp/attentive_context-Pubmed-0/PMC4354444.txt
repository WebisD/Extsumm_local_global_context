this systematic review was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy ( focusing on sensitivity and specificity ) of various screening tools as compared to the diagnostic criteria .
no systematic review has been published to comparatively evaluate the screening tools against the diagnostic criteria from depression in dsm - iv and icd-10 in chd patients . to investigate the performance of screening tools in identifying mdd in chd patients ,
when the performance of a screening tool is evaluated , the high sensitivity and npv should be balanced with the high specificity and ppv , which will provide useful guidance for the application of appropriate tools and optimal cut - off value in the identification of depression in chd patients .
this is the first systematic review in which various depression screening tools were compared with the diagnostic criteria in identification of mdd among chd patients . in our study , phq-9 ( 10 ) , bdi - ii ( 14 or 16 ) , and hads - d ( 5 or 4 )
thus , the positive lr , negative lr , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , negative predictive value ( npv ) , and prevalence were calculated using revman 5.1 . as shown in table 2 , for mdd alone , the sensitivity and specificity of different screening tools at the validity and optimal cut - off point varied from 0.34   to 0.96   and from 0.69   to 0.97   , respectively .
