the objective of this commentary is to review current sodium consumption worldwide , discuss cost - effective strategies to reduce dietary sodium , as well as briefly review the role of behavioural and policy - based environmental interventions in reducing dietary sodium on a population - based scale .
given the promising outcomes observed in recent randomized controlled trials and population - based interventions , reducing dietary sodium intake to modest levels ( approximately 5  g / day ) worldwide would result in a major improvement in overall health and reduce the costs associated with diseases connected to excess sodium intake .
the burden of disease studies also do not account for diseases that have a pathophysiological basis and close association with high sodium diets ( i.e. , increased severity and frequency of asthma attacks , increased calcium containing kidney stones , osteoporosis , or obesity related to the consumption of calorie containing beverages caused by sodium - induced thirst ) . hence the burden of disease associated with excess dietary salt is not only high , but may also be underestimated .
while it may contribute to behaviour change among highly motivated individuals and increase the acceptability of population - based interventions , the latter approach seems better suited for this particular health behaviour .
