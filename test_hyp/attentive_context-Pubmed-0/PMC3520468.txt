light scatter by the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) and choroidal vasculature degrades the quality of images obtained from the choroid in conventional oct methods.1 nevertheless , in vivo cross - sectional visualization of deeper choroidal layers is now achievable with the recent introduction of edi - oct.2,3
optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , since its introduction in the late 90s , has become an indispensible imaging technique for evaluation and management of retinal and optic nerve disorders . as a non - invasive test ,
subfoveal ct has been reported to be increased in csc and vkh disease , but reduced in high myopic chorioretinal atrophy and idiopathic macular hole.11 - 16 the importance of choroidal measurements may emphasize the necessity of creating automated segmentation algorithms similar to the retinal map analysis protocols for faster and more precise evaluation of choroidal structure . in conclusion ,
enhanced depth imaging ( edi)-oct enables cross sectional imaging of the retina with resolution approaching histologic sections . current spectral domain ( sd)-oct devices are empowered by software capable of measuring retinal thickness and constructing retinal maps ; these features are particularly useful in evaluating and comparing retinal structures in pathologic conditions such as macular edema and vitreoretinal interface disorders .
