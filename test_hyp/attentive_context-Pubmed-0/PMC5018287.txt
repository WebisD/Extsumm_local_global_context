the aim of this study was to synthesize agnps using aqueous leaves extract of p. betle , characterized the agnps and evaluated the antibacterial activity of ag - extract nanoparticles against some gram positive and gram negative bacteria .
we have demonstrated a good method for developing a simple , safe , cost - effective , and ecofriendly preparation of agnps using aqueous extract of p. betle .
they showed potential antibacterial activity against both gram - positive and gram negative bacteria . in our study
the ftir spectra revealed the involvement of hydroxyl moieties and n - h bonding in the formation of ag - nps .
we also found , gram positive bacteria are more susceptible on ag - extract nps rather than gram negative bacteria .
aeruginosa atcc 27853 graphical representation of the antibacterial activity of p. betle formed ag - nps on s. aureus atcc 25923 , e. coli atcc 25922 , s. typhi atcc 14028 , p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 the antibacterial activity of the aqueous extracts of p. betle leaves were analyzed against both gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , which are presented in ( figure 6 , table 1 ) .
