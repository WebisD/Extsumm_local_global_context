nowadays , new treatments for schizophrenia are more ambitious , aiming to improve not only psychotic symptoms , but also quality of life and social reinsertion . we briefly but critically outline advances in the treatment of schizophrenia from the mid-1970s up to the present . for many years , it was widely accepted that any effective drugs for schizophrenia would also induce extrapyramidal side effects ( eps ) , and the term  neuroleptic  was originally used to describe such neurologic side effects . however , adverse effects , such as movement disorders and sedation , are problematic and can result in noncompliance with medication .
effects on neuronal survival and plasticity , together with decreased neurotoxicity , might also contribute to their clinical advantages over typical neuroleptic drugs.2
in conclusion , amisulpride , in addition to its proven clinical efficacy , may help reintegration of the schizophrenic patient back into social inclusion .
the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are characterized by poverty of speech , blunted affect , lack of initiative , poor motivation , and a general slowness and underactivity , all of which result in social withdrawal .
recent data indicate that , in the case of the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride , these properties can be translated into a better quality of life , and enhanced social functioning and reintegration into society .
