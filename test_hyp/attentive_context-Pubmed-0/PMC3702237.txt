meanwhile , some modern devices for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( abpm ) allow the assessment of some as indices , and the approach to the analysis of these indices may be quite similar to that of abpm.10 accordingly , the aim of our study was to assess the feasibility of this approach in the management of patients with renal transplantation .
thus , the analysis of the 24-hour pulse wave velocity in the management of patients with renal transplantation using ptin is feasible .
the difference in preoperative dialysis period ( p = 0.0405 ) and the tendency toward a difference in age ( p = 0.0590 ) should be noted .
an insufficiency of endogenous regulators of calcium and phosphate is well known to be a significant factor affecting extraosseous calcifications.1 in dialysis patients and kidney transplant patients , volume overload and disturbances of calcium and phosphate metabolism add to the atherogenic profile , and these serve as independent risk factors for cardiovascular mortality.2 the presence of arterial calcifications was strongly and independently predictive of the outcome in end - stage renal disease ( esrd).3 on this basis , estimating the arterial stiffness ( as ) in esrd is of great interest . measuring the pulse - wave velocity ( pwv ) is a reliable means of determining the as.4,5 there are several studies of pwv in patients with renal transplantation.69 notably , 24-hour pwv analysis has not yet been conducted in adults .
