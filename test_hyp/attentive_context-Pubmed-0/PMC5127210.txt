the goal of this study was to demonstrate that an alternate electrode placement , to accommodate the sternal dressing , would not affect the rvm correlations to the ventilator and to show the utility of using rvm to monitor mv , tv , and rr in cardiac surgery patients after median sternotomy .
it was hypothesized rvm would provide accurate , continuous measurements of mv , tv , and rr in this cohort before and after extubation .
recent development of a non - invasive respiratory volume monitor ( rvm ) that provides quantitative , continuous , real - time measurements of mv , tv and rr in non - intubated patients has addressed a number of these challenges . with the recommended electrode placement and calibration algorithms , strong correlations ( 0.96  0.16 , mean  95% ci for regular and erratic breathing ) between rvm and spirometric measurements
fourteen cardiothoracic patients ( four females and 10 males , average age 69  11.8 years , average bmi 29  6.0 kg / m , eight coronary artery bypasses , four valve replacements , and two myomectomies , table 1 ) were enrolled in an irb approved protocol for monitoring respiratory status in the tufts cardiothoracic unit ( ctu ) .
