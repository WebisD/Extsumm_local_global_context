cases with retinal detachments were divided into two groups : retinal detachments with ad ( ad group ) and without ad ( non - ad group ) .
the present study revealed increased retinal detachment with ad in 1990s followed by a gradual decrease in 2000s . various factors including standard therapy for ad campaign , proactive therapy , and topical and systemic calcineurin inhibitor might contribute to good control of ad disease activities and consequent decrease in retinal detachment with ad .
it is clear that further studies for ophthalmological and dermatological analysis for retinal detachment with ad in a larger scale are required .
herein , we report changes in surgically treated retinal detachment in mie university hospital , mie , japan , for these 20 years .
subsequently , the ad group was divided into two subgroups : patients group surgically treated former 10 years of the study period : from 1992 to 2001 ( former ad group ) and another group treated in recent 10 years from 2002 to 2011 ( recent ad group ) .
improvement of ad therapies decreased the prevalence of ad in 2006 compared with that in 1993.9 in japan , topical tacrolimus therapy is approved as an effective and well - tolerated treatment option for patients with ad.10 these recent changes in ad therapies might influence the prevalence of retinal detachment with ad .
