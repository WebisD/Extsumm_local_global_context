the main aim of the present study was to investigate if affective evaluations of dementia patients can specifically be influenced through a standard evaluative conditioning paradigm .
as hypothesized , dementia patients changed their valence ratings of unfamiliar and previously neutral faces according to its pairing with either a liked or disliked face stimulus . generally , the neutral pictures that were paired with a liked stimulus were rated higher and the neutral picture that was paired with the disliked stimulus was rated lower on the valence dimension after our evaluative conditioning intervention by dementia patients .
thus , results indicate that ratings of initially neutral stimuli can be influenced in the according direction through simple time - near presentation ( i.e. , pairing ) with both a liked as well as a disliked stimuli
  the ucs and cs in evaluative conditioning paradigms belong to the same type of stimuli ( e.g. , faces ) .
similarly , tranel and damasio   report the case of a patient with bilateral damage to the entire medial lobe who could learn connections between unfamiliar persons and affective valence they displayed , despite severely impaired explicit memory .   in summary ,
hence , in the present study we addressed the question if affective evaluations of dementia patients can be manipulated using a standard evaluative conditioning paradigm .
