in addition to the above concerns in antibiotic development , many of the agents exhibit toxic effects on the host . in part , we surmise , this is due to unique evolutionary relationships that link selective biochemical and molecular aspects of mitochondrial biology to primordial processes in bacterial progenitors .
we speculate that in susceptible individuals and ones using these agents for extended periods of time and non - recommended doses , antibiotics may turn an acute stress response into one that is chronic .
this occurs because our drug discovery process fine tunes itself as resistance develops and we simultaneously develop stereo specific overlaps with naturally occurring biochemicals , altering their actions downstream .
these antibiotics vary , concerning their structure and mechanism of action . today , many of these drugs are not so effective because bacteria develop resistance , revealing a major challenge for our society .
pathological perturbations of this process via antibiotics , demonstrate the role this enslaved bacterium performs .
the third way resistance to antibiotics occurs is by targeting new sites , e.g. , methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) . instead of just relying on the original penicillin binding proteins to maintain bacterial membrane integrity , this strain of bacteria obtained dna from an unknown bacterial donor .
