furthermore , we will give an overview of recent studies describing strategies to target fr- selectively expressed on activated macrophages for the diagnosis and therapy of human inflammatory diseases .
for this reason , frs have been regarded as promising molecular targets for both diagnostics and therapeutic treatment of a variety of human diseases . in this review
, we will introduce the characteristics and structures of frs and discuss their expression profiles on normal , as well as pathogenic , cells .
folic acid has emerged as a promising ligand for the selective delivery of imaging and therapeutic agents to target cells , such as cancer cells and activated macrophages , in inflammatory sites ( 1 ) . as a selective targeting ligand ,
moreover , few therapeutic drugs developed based on the strategy of selective fr targeting have been reported so far for these diseases , which raises the necessity of developing new potential drugs targeting frs with strong efficacies and minimal toxicities . in conclusion , selective targeting of frs , especially fr- on activated macrophages , could be a promising strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of macrophage - mediated inflammatory diseases , and there will be a high demand for the development of fr - targeted efficacious and safe therapeutics .
