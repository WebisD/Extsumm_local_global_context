the maneuverability of designing the materials at the nanoscale and tunability on its surface make this an independent branch of science having wide applicability .
application of nanotechnology in biology is thought to be one of the most successful and wide spread areas of utility , which includes basic understanding of biological event as well as medical diagnosis , surgery and therapy17181920 .
also people prepared and used nanoparticles in different fields of art and medicine , without knowing their in - depth physico - chemical properties , but believing their potential to prevent diseases .
schematic representation of potential nano - mediated cardiovascular imaging in diagnosis and therapy ( e.g. identification of thrombus , monitoring graft rejection , stem cell tracking , and identification of angiogenesis , etc . )
biomolecule compatible size distribution of nanoforms along with their tuneable properties ( physical , chemical , topological ) help nanotechnology to merge with biology to give birth to one of the most advanced fields of science - nanobiotechnology212223 .
one important aspect is related to the stent technology . with the advancement of technology drug eluting stents
nanotechnology is considered as a cutting edge technology in the 21 century . in ancient period
