despite using a proximal coronary snare , this method of hemostasis can be incomplete in the presence of severe atheroma or calcification , causing bleeding through the arteriotomy site .
however , direct injection to the aortic root following a sternotomy appears to be feasible and may be life - saving , as severe right ventricular dysfunction may limit systemic drug delivery injected through the venous side despite the performance of direct cardiac massage . in the current case , intra - aortic injection of epinephrine may have resulted in a more effective increase in the systemic vascular resistance , thereby increasing the coronary perfusion pressure and thus facilitating emboli clearance . in conclusion , in the rare case of a gas embolism occurring during opcab occurs , the potential for catastrophic results necessitates immediate and appropriate managements including supportive measures , needle aspiration of gas , and cpr with direct cardiac massage . in refractory cases , while considering emergent conversion to cpb , direct injection of drugs to the aortic root can be attempted before initiating cpb .
this may be a simple , relatively safe , and life - saving approach for the management of a gas embolism during opcab because a sternotomy has already been conducted .
