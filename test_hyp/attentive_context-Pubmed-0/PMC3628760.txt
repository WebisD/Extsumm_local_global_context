children who have sob as main complaint with high levels of total sige should receive ics therapy , whereas cough phenotype group with high levels of eosinophilic % and secp should receive montelukast . while wheezy group with mixed eosinophilic and ige mediated pattern could receive therapeutic trials of either ics or ltras with an assessment of the response .
  patients ( n = 203 ) 8 to 14 years of age with partially controlled asthma were enrolled in the study after validation of their symptoms   into shortness of breath , cough , and wheezy phenotype groups .
we hypothesize an approach to classify asthma phenotypes based on symptomatology in correlation with cytokine profile and airway inflammatory biomarkers as a trial to individualize asthma treatment . beside our trial to characterize the proposed clinical asthma phenotypes , we aim to detect whether those clinical asthma phenotypes may affect the response to the main controller medications
cough group responded to montelukast alone with significant improvement in both fev1 and asthma symptom scores and with significant decrease in peripheral eosinophilic % and secp ( table 3 ) .  
shortness of breath group responded to fluticasone alone with significant improvement in both fev1 and asthma symptom scores as well as significant decrease of peripheral eosinophilic percentage , secp , sicam , and total serum ige ( table 2 ) . on the other aspect ,
