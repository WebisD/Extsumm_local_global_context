babies whose mothers received prenatal care have a predicted hospital cost of $ 1,064.61 , compared with $ 2,068.66 for those whose mothers did not receive care prior to the onset of labor  a difference of $ 1,004.05 .
although the incidence of low and very low birth weights , premature labor , transfers to acute - care facilities , and early death was significantly greater for those women who had no prenatal care , the combined impact on total cost of care is not large in an absolute sense .
the independent effect of prenatal care on birth weight , adjusted for differences in other regressors in equation 1 , is 145 grams ( 5.09 ounces ) . in other words , even after adjusting for other differences , infants born to females who receive prenatal care weigh about 145 grams more than those whose mothers do not receive prenatal care .
referring to table 5 , these babies also are less likely to fall into the low- and very low - birth - weight categories ( 10.23 percent versus 17.42 percent ) , proportionately fewer are born prematurely ( 4.60 percent versus 9.50 percent ) , the incidence of transfer to an acute - care facility is less than one - half ( 0.71 percent versus 1.85 percent ) , and the incidence of early death is much lower ( 0.38 percent versus 2.11 percent ) .
