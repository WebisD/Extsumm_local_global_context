the present study was performed to evaluate the efficiency of a panel of 16 microsatellite markers , including the eight recommended by mapa ( 2004 ) , in parentage testing of brazilian goats from four commercial and four naturalized breeds .
( 2010 ) validated a panel of 11 microsatellite markers for paternity testing of brazilian goats , with combined probabilities of exclusion ( pec ) of paternity of 0.999591 and 0.988375 , in cases where the maternal genotype was known or unknown , respectively . when used to evaluate a group of registered goats , this particular set of markers detected 10% of paternity errors .
brazilian caninde ( ca ) and repartida ( re ) breeds showed values higher than the mean for he , pic , for he , pic , as well as pec1 and 2 ( probability of exclusion 1 and probability of exclusion 2 ) , while the moxoto ( mo ) breed showed the highest number of alleles ( 5.25 ) .
for the parentage test validation it was possible to obtain results from five of the six trios analyzed , and in 100% of the cases the correct father was assigned for each of the five trios with a strict level of confidence ( 95% ) , and with either panel 1 or 2 .
