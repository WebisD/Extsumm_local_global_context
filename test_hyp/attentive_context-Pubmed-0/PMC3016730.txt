its importance , however , may lie in the fact that the cystic vein can serve as a landmark during a difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy to decrease the risk of inadvertent bile duct injury .
our experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy supports the importance of anatomic identification in the safe performance of the procedure and also suggests the presence of a useful and reproducible anatomic landmark which can help define a zone of safe dissection within the triangle of calot .
a common factor in the reported cases of bile duct injury is the misidentification of common duct for cystic duct , resulting in resection of a portion of the common bile and hepatic ducts and a right hepatic artery injury .
precautions suggested to decrease the possibility of bile duct injury have included : routine cystic duct cholangiography , cholecystocholangiography , confirmed identification of the junction of the cystic duct with the common bile and hepatic ducts and identification of the junction of the cystic artery with the right hepatic artery .
this study is derived from a single surgeon 's experience with more than 300 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed since 1991 .
the increased rate of bile duct injury has been attributed to a steep learning curve for laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
