we also propose an algorithm for choosing the correct side of the fibula for a particular reconstructive need and at the same time minimising the donor side morbidity .
head and neck oncological resections may result in composite oro - mandibular defects involving the oral mucosa ( lining ) , mandibular bone and the skin ( cover ) .
the purpose of this study is to confirm anatomically the effect of bone , soft tissue and vessel orientation on the ease of doing reconstruction .
there is always a possibility of using the bone flap in a more efficient fashion for the reconstructive need .
composite fibula flaps of the same dimension were harvested from both legs of a fresh cadaver .
the algorithm based selection of appropriate sided fibula flap facilitates complex mandibular reconstruction by placing the right kind of tissue at the right place and helps in reducing the donor site morbidity by allowing the surgeon to harvest only the required amount of skin .
existing literature , however , provides conflicting views about the use of a particular side and orientation of the fibula flap for achieving the optimal outcome .
the harvested flaps were used to reconstruct the mandibular defect in different orientations , and the best configuration for each reconstructive requirement was assessed .
