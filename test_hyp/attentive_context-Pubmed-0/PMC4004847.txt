we report the case of a 9-yr - old girl with turner syndrome who developed graves 
 disease during recombinant human gh therapy , and we discuss previous reports of this 
 association .
an increased incidence of hashimoto thyroiditis has been reported in patients with turner 
 syndrome . in view of its pathogenic relationship with autoimmune thyroiditis
these results are compatible with a diagnosis of graves disease and treatment 
 with thiamazole was started .  
it is important to monitor changes of thyroid function as well as growth parameters in 
 patients with turner syndrome , as is recommended by sybert and mccauley ( 14 ) .
the patient was the first child of healthy unrelated parents of normal stature , father 
 175.0  cm and mother 159.0  cm .
is that diagnosis of complete gh deficiency is less than 5 
 ng / ml in this assay .
growth curve of the patient at the latest follow up ( 9 y old ) , the development of the patient s breast was tanner stage 
 1 .
table 1table 1 graves disease in turner syndrome summarizes the historical thirteen known cases of graves disease with turner 
 syndrome , including our case .
treatment with thiamazole was continued and the thyroid function has stayed within normal 
 ranges .
