we revealed alterations in bacterial composition , e.g. selection of 
 qnrb- and ampc - positive c. freundii isolates , in 
 addition to a decrease in the total number of coliforms .
we have demonstrated that the counts of coliform bacteria 
 significantly decreased during and after the period for administration of orb .
moreover , we could not detect 
 strongly fq - resistant mutants among isolates of e. coli and c. 
 freundii .
only e. coli 
 was detected in all cats on day 1 , whereas isolates of c. freundii and 
 e. coli were detected as a dominant species of all cats in groups a and b 
 after cessation of orb treatment .
the cats were randomized 
 into three groups ( groups a , b and c ) of three cats each .
, wherein all fecal e. coli isolates exhibit high - level 
 resistance to enrofloxacin after treatment of dogs with the drug . in general
, the concept of 
 a mutant selection window has considerable implications for the acquisition of fq 
 resistance , and antimicrobials at concentrations beyond the mutant prevention concentration 
 ( mpc ) can prevent the development of fq - resistant mutants . in our study , the fecal orb concentration in cats treated with the doses of 
 2.5 and 5.0 mg / kg far exceeds the mpc value of e. coli ( 0.532 
 g / ml ) ; this result has been confirmed by another study 
 .
