therefore , these glibenclamide - loaded ihm - alginate mucoadhesive beads were found suitable for prolonged systemic absorption of glibenclamide through sustained drug release and mucoadhesive properties after oral administration maintaining tight blood glucose level and improved patient compliance in the management of non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus .
these developed optimized mucoadhesive beads demonstrated high drug encapsulation , good mucoadhesivity with the biological membrane , sustained drug release profile at a controlled rate , and significant antidiabetic activity in alloxan - induced diabetic rats over prolonged period after oral administration .
in this investigation , glibenclamide - loaded ihm - alginate mucoadhesive beads were successfully developed and optimized .
moreover , the technique for the preparation of these beads was found simple , economical , and consistent .
this type of beads can also be exploited for drug delivery of other drugs to improve their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy .
factorial designs , where all the factors are studied in all possible combinations , are considered the most efficient in estimating the influence of individual variables and their interactions performing minimum numbers of experiments . a computer - aided optimization technique based on 3 ( two factors and three levels ) factorial design and response surface methodology was employed to investigate the effects of two independent process variables ( factors ) , that is , sa : ihm and cross - linker ( cacl2 ) concentration on the properties of glibenclamide - loaded ionotropically gelled ihm - alginate beads such as drug encapsulation and drug release .
