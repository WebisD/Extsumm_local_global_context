the ease of use means that , if used in conjunction with formal mmtt , ucpcr may be useful for screening patients for initial inclusion and also follow - up during intervention trials . in conclusion , our study demonstrates that in children and adults with type 1 diabetes , ucpcr may be a practical noninvasive alternative to the mmtt for use in routine clinical practice .
as would be predicted , ucpcr values were lower after a meal compared with the standard mmtt , and so a lower concentration of ucpcr was required to suggest clinically significant insulin deficiency .
we studied 72 children ( n = 21 ) and adults with type 1 diabetes without known renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml / min/1.73 m ) ( supplementary tables 1 and 2 ) . patients underwent a standard mmtt ( 1 ) .
this is probably explained by a lower stimulus , as shown by the lower 120-min ucpcr in the home postprandial samples than in those in the mmtt ( 0.16 nmol / mmol [ interquartile range 0.010.76 ] vs. 0.35 nmol / mmol   ; p < 0.0001 ) .
the strong correlation of ucpcr with serum c - peptide in the mmtt is supported by previous studies that have shown that timed measures of urinary c - peptide are a useful marker of endogenous insulin secretion ( 7,913 ) .
