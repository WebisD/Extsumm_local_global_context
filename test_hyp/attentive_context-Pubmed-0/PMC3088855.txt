this is the first case report of a child with thymic hyperplasia simulating a fat containing mass accompanied by pericardial lipomatosis and right facial hemihypertrophy .
no child cases of pericardial lipomatosis have been reported in the english literature . to the best of our knowledge ,
thymic hyperplasia is defined as the enlargement of the thymus with a histologically normal cortical and medullary component .
an 8-year - old boy visited the outpatient clinic for evaluation of facial asymmetry and narrowing of the right external auditory canal . upon physical examination ,
although the diagnosis and exclusion of several hyperplastic syndromes may be available with genetic studies , it may not be of any help in differentiating proteus syndrome from hhml since there are no molecular studies available at this moment . until molecular mechanisms of the hemihyperplasia syndromes are further elucidated , thorough observation of any change in the clinical findings will remain essential for the diagnosis of patients . in conclusion , we have reviewed and discussed the imaging findings of a rare combination of thymic hyperplasia , pericardial lipomatosis and facial hemihypertrophy in a pediatric patient .
the hyperplastic gland can become very large ; however , besides its larger size , the imaging appearance of the enlarged thymus is normal ( 1 ) .
