thus , the present study examined the muscle recovery level in detail by determining the 
 speed of blood flow within the muscle and change in pain subjectively after treatment with 
 simple exercise and pnf treatment methods in for supraspinatus muscle tear patients .
these were limitation of this research , and future 
 research should use mri and echography for diagnosis both and only utilize patients who 
 experiencing their first case of supraspinatus muscle damage to reduce the level of 
 errors .
when looking at the change in subjective pain ( vas ) between before and after pnf treatment 
 and simple exercise , pnf the pnf treatment group showed a vas score of 4.33.1 before 
 treatment and a vas score of 3.62.5 after 12 weeks .
in this research , 20 shoulder joint rupture patients were subjected to pnf treatment or 
 simple exercise therapy for 12 weeks to observe their influences on the speed of blood flow 
 in the supraspinatus muscle , change in subjective pain , and functional aspects of the 
 shoulder joint ; thus , the factors above were analyzed , and they are discussed below .
change 
 in dash score between before and after pnf treatment and simple exercise . when looking at 
 the results of the dash questionnaires administered before and after pnf treatment and 
 simple exercise , the pnf treatment group showed a dash score of 23.110.2 before treatment 
 and a dash score of 13.16.7 after 12 weeks , indicating a significant decrease ( p<0.05 ) .
