nonsurvivors were older ( p = 0.001 ) and had longer duration of hypertension ( p = 0.041 ) and higher body mass index than survivors .
although there are indications that sh plays a major role in cardiovascular outcomes , there is paucity of data particularly in the northeast nigeria on mortality profile of hypertension - related admissions into the medical wards , hence this study .
this upsurge in the incidence of sh and its complications in sub - saharan africa with high burden of infectious diseases and poverty had greatly reduced the life expectancy in this part of the world .
women empowerment programs and provision of gainful employment by the government will reduce poverty and improve medication compliance among hypertensive individuals .
the mean duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in nonsurvivors ( 6.6  7.8 days ) in comparison to survivors ( 11.7  13.6 days ) , p = 0.001 .
hypertension - related admissions are associated with excess mortality , and stroke is the commonest .
of the total 3108 admissions , 735 ( 23.7% ) were due to hypertension - related complications , with mean age of 51.9    17.5 years .
community intervention to health - educate the populace on the need for early detection , dangers of sh , and other cardiovascular risk factors is urgently needed .
