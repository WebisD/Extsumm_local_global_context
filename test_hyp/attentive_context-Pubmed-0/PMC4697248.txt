we would like to share our experience of two cases that underwent tte and developed acute respiratory distress in the post - operative period .
a 39-year - old woman , known case of oesophageal carcinoma , was scheduled for tte with extended two - field lymphadenectomy with gastric pull - up with cervical neck oesophago - gastric anastomosis and feeding jejunostomy .
providing anaesthesia for tte is always a challenge for the anaesthesiologists because of intraoperative need for one - lung ventilation and its associated problems .
we also emphasise on the need for careful monitoring of respiratory status in patients having corrugated neck drain after tte .
post - operative pulmonary complications in the early post - operative period can lead to increased morbidity and mortality .
pulmonary complications can also occur due to surgical issues that may mislead the perioperative team and result in unnecessary and avoidable interventions .
our two cases reveal a rare cause of respiratory distress and air leak in patients who underwent tte . in these cases ,
only two cases of pneumothorax associated with neck drains have been described . in both the cases , air leak was seen following transhiatal oesophagectomy . in our cases ,
