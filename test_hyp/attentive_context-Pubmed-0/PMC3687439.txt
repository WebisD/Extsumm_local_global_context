the present study describes a case of a 9-year - old girl suffering from recklinghausen 's disease with neurofibromatosis of the face , salivary gland and external ear in the form of an extensive tumour . in consequence ,
considering the malocclusion they are suffering from , children diagnosed with recklinghausen 's syndrome should undergo orthodontic consultation and , if necessary , should be treated using removable appliances , so that the malformation of the masticatory organ does not intensify .
the study aimed at identifying changes in the masticatory organ and specifying possibilities of orthodontic treatment of a patient suffering from recklinghausen 's disease .
medical literature defines recklinghausen 's disease , also known as neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf1 ) , as an autosomal dominant disease characterised by abnormalities affecting tissues derived from the neural crest .
the computer - assisted tomography examination identified acute atrophy of the maxilla , zygomatic bone , mandible alveolar ridge and right base of the skull ( fig .
the differential diagnosis of nf1 should focus on excluding such disorders as rare mosaic or segmental neurofibromatosis type 1 , neurofibromatosis type 2 , schwannomatosis , noonan syndrome , watson phenotype , caf - au - lait spots inherited as an autosomal dominant condition , autosomal dominant mccune - albright syndrome , leopard syndrome , klippel - trnaunay syndrome , proteus syndrome , multiple lipomas , bannayan - riley - ruvalcaba syndrome , fibromatosis , multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2b as well as homozygosity for one of the genes responsible for causing hereditary non - polyposis cancer of the colon .
