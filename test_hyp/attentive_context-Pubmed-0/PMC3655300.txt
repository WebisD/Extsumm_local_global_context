we , hereby , describe a case of ascending branch of the left pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm , following a left upper lobectomy , for which a transcatheter endovascular embolisation of the aneurysm with intra - aneurysmal n - butyl 2-cyanoacrylate ( glue ) injection was performed .
pulmonary artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are uncommon ; most are caused by infections , like tuberculosis , vasculitis ( behet 's syndrome ) or trauma , often iatrogenic ; less common causes include pulmonary hypertension , congenital heart disease , lung carcinoma , and connective tissue disease ( 1 - 3 ) . because of potential risk of high mortality , secondary to pseudoaneurysm enlargement and rupture , prompt
intraaneurysmal injection of the liquid embolic materials is feasible , safe , and effective trancatheter treatment option for pulmonary artery aneurysms and is possibly not associated with the risk of rupture seen with packing of aneurysms with coils .
a 30-year - lady had been presented to us 3 months ago with multiple episodes of hemoptysis and one major episode of 400 cc , and gave us a history of intermittent fever , cough , breathlessness and chest pain for a period of 2 - 3 months .
