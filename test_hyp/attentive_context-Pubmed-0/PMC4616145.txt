in this review , the types of vr programs that have been used in cognitive evaluations of 
 patients with brain injury were identified and studies of cognitive interventions were 
 reviewed according to pico methods . in the included studies , the vr programs could 
 distinguish the cognitive disability of patients in comparisons with healthy subjects .
although the use of vr in cognitive 
 rehabilitation has been increasing , few systematic reviews have investigated the use of vr 
 programs in cognitive rehabilitation and the overall effect of these programs on cognition . 
 therefore , this systematic review investigated the different types of vr programs used for 
 cognitive evaluation and interventions for patients with brain injury .
thus , 
 vr could be used as a new assessment method of the cognitive function of patients with brain 
 injury .
well - designed rcts and blind studies will be needed to provide evidence of the benefits of 
 vr on cognitive function .
the results of this systematic review suggest that vr is an effective cognitive therapy for 
 patients with brain injury compared to control therapy .
exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) subjects who were animals or children ; ( 2 ) 
 review articles ; and ( 3 ) 2d computer - based cognitive rehabilitation .
