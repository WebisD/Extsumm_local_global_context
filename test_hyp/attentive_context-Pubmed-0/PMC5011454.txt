we report a case of neuropathy caused by malposition of an acetabular cup screw causing direct injury to the sciatic nerve .
results from the literature show that operative intervention is often pursued to explore and directly visualize the nerve with limited results in the literature showing modest relief of pain and sensory symptoms and poor restoration of motor function .
approximately 225,000 primary total hip arthroplasties ( thas ) are performed in the united states per year , and projections indicate that more than 4 million thas will be performed annually by 2030.1 neurologic injury after tha is reported to occur in 0.09 to 3.7% of primary thas and 0 to 7.4% of revision thas.2 noted causes of neurologic injury include direct intraoperative nerve injury , leg lengthening , excess retraction , cement extravasation , cement - related thermal damage , patient positioning , and postoperative hematoma.2 the majority of these injuries are symptomatic within the early postoperative period and can be managed conservatively with close follow - up . delayed onset of neurologic injury
delayed neuropathy is a rare complication after primary tha that can be caused by hardware irritation as in the present case .
the presentation , intervention , and outcome of other cases of delayed neuropathy are reviewed in the present report .
