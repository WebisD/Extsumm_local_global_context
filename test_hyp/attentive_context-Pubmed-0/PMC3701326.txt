using a mouse knockin model of the flt3-itd mutation , we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which constitutive gfr signaling might subvert lineage specification in mpps and alter the cell fate of early lymphoid progenitors , in order to explain the myeloid bias of the resulting leukemias .
transformation to an aggressive leukemia exclusively of a myeloid phenotype by introduction of runx1 mutation demonstrates the functional relevance of this flt3-itd - induced myeloid bias and clonal dominance , providing insights into the process by which oncogenic mutations might determine the lineage fate of the resulting leukemias at the precommitment stage .
, we used a knockin model of flt3-itd to investigate whether oncogenic mutations that result in constitutive gfr signaling influence the lineage fate of mpps in  vivo . in order to first establish the physiological relevance of flt3-itd as an aml - inducing mutation
our findings are also of considerable relevance for normal hematopoiesis , as it remains disputed whether key cytokine receptor signaling pathways mediate critical in  vivo functions in blood lineage development through purely permissive rather than instructive actions ( enver and jacobsen , 2009 ) . thus , although flt3-itd elicits aberrant signaling , our findings clearly provide support for the notion that cytokine receptors are also capable of eliciting lineage - instructive signaling in mpps in  vivo .
