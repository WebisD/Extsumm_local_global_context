composites resin and bleaching agents tested the samples from each composite resin material were further divided into three groups ; groups 1 , 2 and 3 with n = 6 .
nanocomposite and nanohybrid composite resins bleached with 10 or 20% cp bleaching agents result in the same outcome . on the other hand ,
kelfil showed significant change in hardness with a p value of 0.001 and there was also a significant change in tph 3 with a p value of 0.021 .
the afm evaluation of surface roughness showed that both bleaching agents yielded ra values below 200 nm for all materials tested , which poses no risk of the accumulation of plaque .
the afm evaluation of surface roughness observed in the 3d images promises to be an effective technique .
the aim of this study was to study the effects of home bleaching on the hardness and surface morphology of a universal nanocomposite , an anterior nanocomposite , and a nanohybrid composite .
median roughness number ( ra , nm ) and interquartile range of the three tested composite resins after 14 days of bleaching with 10 and 20% cp median vickers hardness number and interquartile range of the three tested composite resins after 14 days of bleaching with 10 and 20% cp median vickers hardness number and interquartile range for kelfil after 14 days of bleaching with 10 and 20% cp median vickers hardness number and interquartile range for tph 3 after 14 days of bleaching with 10 and 20% cp table 2 shows the roughness number ( ra ) of the three types of composites that were bleached with 10 and 20% cp home bleaching agents .
