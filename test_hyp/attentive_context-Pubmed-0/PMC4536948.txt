this mixed - methods study ( yin , 2003 ) seeks to more accurately identify perceptions of acceptance for various age- , race- , and sexual identity - based segments of the population within the gay and mainstream communities at a pivotal time in the evolution of both urban gay communities and mainstream societal attitudes . while the use of survey data aligns with extant studies that measure gay community attachment ( barrett & pollack , 2005 ; frost & meyer , 2012 ) , the addition of interviews with self - identified gay and bisexual men and service providers allows for the creation of new , grounded theory ( strauss & corbin , 1990 ) about gay community inclusion and its relationship to the changing social contexts of north america .
