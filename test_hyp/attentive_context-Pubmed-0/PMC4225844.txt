the headspace solid - phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( hs - spme / gc - ms ) was applied to determine the levels of gsm and 2-mib in water samples , and this method can be obtained in our early reports   . in addition , the water samples were collected in detail as follows : firstly , for water sources of tap water , four kinds of water samples were collected respectively from four cities in jiangsu , including city a ( little lakes as the source ) , city b ( the changjiang river as source ) , city c ( lake taihu as source ) , and city d ( underground water as the source ) ; secondly , for conventional treatment process of tap water , including coagulation and sedimentation , filtration , and disinfection , the water samples were collected respectively from above processes ; thirdly , for different seasons of water samples , we collected the samples in three periods in lake taihu , including the period when a river is at its normal level ( november to december ) , drought period ( february to march ) , and wet season ( july to august ) when the algae bloom .
