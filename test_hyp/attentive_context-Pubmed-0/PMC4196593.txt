my favorite example is that antibiotics came out of finding a random contaminant on a plate . and remember that we have crispr [ clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ] tools only because people were studying some bizarro antipathogen mechanism in bacteria .
the truth is that most medical breakthroughs have ultimately come from basic research , and i think that we as scientists need to do a better job of telling these success stories .
right now it seems like funding agencies and the public have an engineering mentality , and they believe that , as long as we think hard enough about a problem , we can solve it .
i would argue that under some circumstances , studying yeast cells is a better idea than studying highly transformed human cells in a dish .
it s a beautiful example of something entirely unanticipated coming out of left field . that s why it s important to maintain funding for a very diverse program of basic research ; history tells us you ca nt predict where the next advance will come from .
that s an admirable attitude , but in the life sciences it s not always the right path to discovery .
