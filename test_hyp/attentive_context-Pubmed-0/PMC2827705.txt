the aim of the present study was to investigate whether early weaning constitutes a risk factor for overweight at preschool age and to determine whether children s current diet , physical activity level and birth weight and their mothers body mass index ( bmi ) are associated with overweight .
in the present study , the protective effect of breastfeeding against overweight was only shown in univariate analysis ; it did not persist after controlling for other variables .
, the results of our study suggest that the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against overweight among preschool children is of a lower magnitude than the effects of genetic factors and other environmental factors . maternal overweight , birth weight and sedentarism are important risk factors for overweight in this age group .
in univariate analysis , the children who had received exclusive or predominant breastfeeding for less than four months presented a greater risk of overweight than did those who had received exclusive or predominant breastfeeding for four months or more ( or = 1.69 ; 95% ci : 1.102.60 ; p = 0.02 ) .
lucas et al.42 reported differences in endocrine responses with regard to the release of pancreatic and intestinal hormones between newborns breastfed with maternal milk and those fed with infant formula .
