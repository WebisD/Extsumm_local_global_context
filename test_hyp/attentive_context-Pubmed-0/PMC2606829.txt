, we believe that the 16-item dmsat offers a comprehensive assessment of satisfaction with diabetes therapy and may aid in individualizing patient diabetes treatment .
the dmsat is intended as a brief measure of diabetes medication treatment satisfaction and discriminates between important correlates of patient management .
it performed as well as the dtsq in detecting self - rated glucose control and health worries but showed superior properties in correspondence with treatment complexity and a1c .
as shown in table 1 , dmsat scales and total score discriminated ( p < 0.05 ) between high and low levels of treatment complexity , self - rated glucose control , mos health worries scale score , and clinical value for recent a1c ( < 8% vs. 8% ) in the expected direction .
items for four concepts identified in the literature were  glucose control ,   well - being and side - effects ,   lifestyle burden ,  and  treatment complexity and convenience  and were evaluated in a series of five focus groups made up of five to eight patients drawn from an evaluation study of community diabetes clinics in north carolina ( 11 ) .
discriminant validity of the dmsat was examined by comparing means across levels of a1c ( < 8% and 8% ) , treatment complexity ( low and high ) , self - reported adherence , and mos health worries . for the final test sample ,
