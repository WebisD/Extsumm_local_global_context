the aim of this study was to set up a lamp test for detection of h. pylori using designed primers targeted a highly conserved region of the urec gene .
the purpose of the current study was designing , analyzing and comparing pcr and lamp targeted urec to detect h. pylori .
in order to setting up the lamp and pcr reactions , the dna of a clinical isolate of h. pylori was used .
, positive result is shown by white insoluble magnesium pyrophosphate and can be seen with the naked eyes ( 17 - 19 ) .
is advised as a technique which is highly specialized and sensitive , quick and simple in identifying h. pylori .
the pcr method is also highly specific in identifying h. pylori ; however , this method suffers limitations such as needing expensive equipment , having a complex protocol and also need to a thermo cycler machine in order to regulate a cycle of temperatures while the lamp can be carried out in a isothermal temperature without the need for thermo cycler and expensive equipment . as a result lamp with the target sequence of the urec gene
the detection limit of the lamp with new designed primers was 6 copy numbers of h. pylori dna in each reaction .
