the or ( 95% ci ) for any form of diabetes in individuals with transferrin saturation of 50% vs. < 50% was 3.3 ( 2.64.2 ; p = 0.0001 ) . in the combined studies , or in the meta - analysis under the random - effects model was 2.1 ( 1.33.4 ; p = 0.003 ) for any form of diabetes in those with transferrin saturation 50% vs. < 50% ( fig .
heterogeneity for the combined results for men and women was q = 17 and p = 0.001 for any form of diabetes , q = 15 and p = 0.001 for type 1 diabetes , and q = 0.7 and p = 0.7 for type 2 diabetes .
risk of diabetes according to transferrin saturation 50% vs. < 50% in the cchs , the cgps , a case - control study , and combined .
the ors for type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the combined studies in the meta - analysis under the random - effects model were 2.6 ( 1.25.6 ; p = 0.01 ) and 1.7 ( 1.42.1 ; p = 0.001 ) , respectively , in those with transferrin saturation 50% vs. < 50% ( fig .
