statistically significant differences in elasticity could be established between the following regions : the central anterior cornea is stiffer than any other region ( p = 0.05 ) ; the mid anterior cornea is stiffer than the mid posterior , central posterior , and peripheral anterior cornea ( p = 0.05 ) ; and the peripheral posterior cornea is stiffer than the central posterior , mid posterior , and peripheral anterior cornea ( p = 0.05 ) .
while arfem results in the central cornea are in reasonable agreement with other techniques , including needle indentation and torsional rheometry , lack of mechanical data in the peripheral cornea makes comparisons difficult .
however , it is clear that the full picture of corneal biomechanics is quite broad , from complex and inhomogenous collagen microstructure to varying concentration of pg throughout the cornea . a better understanding of these variables along with elasticity measurements , especially in the peripheral cornea , would certainly help in completing the picture .
we found that there is a unique distribution of elasticity axially and radially throughout the cornea .
future modifications of arfem to automate the measurement procedure , specifically the movement of the sample with respect to the confocal volume , will result in an elasticity map with greater spatial density and may help provide this information .
