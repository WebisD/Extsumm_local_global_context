the advent of new neurophysiological techniques to assess retinal and brain ( optic tract ) function , such as electroretinography ( erg ) and the measurement of visual evoked potentials ( vep ) , allowed a more detailed study of the visual function and of the effects that dm can have on it .
there is indication for specific techniques such as the optical coherence tomography or oct ( in particular in the presence of a macular edema ) and the intravenous fluorescein angiography ( ivfa ) , which , however , is an invasive examination ( it needs an intravenous injection of a contrast medium ) . in recent years , psychophysical and electrofunctional exams are having an increasing use because several studies have shown the sensitivity of these methods in identifying signs of the disease already in the preclinical phase . over the past two decades ,
visual abnormalities in diabetes must be approached in a broader sense , considering the visual function as a complex sensory system .
although with some technical limitations and quite high costs , the erg , and the study of oscillatory potentials and mferg in particular , have definitely proved to be a valuable and objective tool for the early diagnosis of the disease and potentially for the ophthalmologic follow - up of the diabetic patient .
