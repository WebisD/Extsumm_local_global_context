herein we report our experience from two north american transplant centers in a series of patients who received plerixafor salvage while failing chemotherapy and g - csf mobilization .
limited data are available on the preemptive use of plerixafor salvage in patients failing to collect adequate numbers of pbpc with chemotherapy and g - csf - based mobilization   , and this topic has been reviewed recently .
utilizing the median wbc count of 32/l at the time of administration of plerixafor in our patients , we found that we were able to collect a higher number of cd34 + cells in patients who had a wbc count 32/l as compared to those with a wbc count > 32/l ( 1.67  10/kg versus 0.8  10/kg , p = 0.02 resp . ) .
generally a cd34 + cell count of 1013/l is used as a cutoff for initiating apheresis following cytokine only , cytokine plus plerixafor , or chemomobilization in majority of transplant centers in the country . the median cd34 + cell count of our patients was only 3.5/l with 82% less than 10/l at the time of the first plerixafor dose , and all patients were able to collect a minimum of 2  10 cells / kg . however
