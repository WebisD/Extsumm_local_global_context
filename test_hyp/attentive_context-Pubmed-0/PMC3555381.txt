kcm is itself very rare and distinct type of keratoacanthoma which usually occurs over extremities and scalp is unusual site for development of lesion .
keratoacanthoma ( ka ) is a rapidly evolving tumor , composed of keratinizing squamous cells originating in pilosebaceous follicles and resolving spontaneously if left untreated .
treatment is difficult as lesion of kcm present with large raised , rolled borders with peripheral extension .
the most common locations are dorsa of hands and legs , lesions on scalp being rare .
progressive peripheral extension with a raised rolled - out margin and atrophy at the centre is a characteristic feature of kcm .
the role of human papilloma virus remains inconclusive but in one study , hpv type 6 and 11 were detected within the lesion .
surgical intervention is a preferred mode of therapy keeping in mind that a wide excision is performed to prevent subsequent recurrence .
