we report a case of ten which was induced by multiple drugs some of which have been rarely implicated in the causation of ten .
toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) is a rare life threatening idiosyncratic mucocutaneous drug reaction characterized by widespread epidermal necrosis followed by epidermal detachment .
a 42-year - old woman was referred to medical emergency with extensive epidermal detachment and ocular , genital , and oral lesions of 5 days duration leading to a diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) .
ten in this patient was probably caused by paracetamol and metoclopramide , but a possibility of an interaction as well as the role of other drugs can not be ruled out .
drug - induced ten is the commonest cause and antiepileptics , antibiotics , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) and allopurinol are the most commonly implicated agents . here
this is most likely a case of drug - induced ten as other causes like upper respiratory tract infection , viral infection , or malignancy were not present .
the patient showed steady improvement with the therapy given and was discharged , after 8 days , without any sequelae .
