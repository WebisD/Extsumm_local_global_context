our objectives for this study were to determine whether abnormal cgm results are associated with subsequent development of cfrd , lung function , and bmi decline and increased rate of cf pulmonary exacerbations .
the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , and npv of cgm for subsequent diagnosis of cfrd were 0.63 ( ci 0.30.86 ) , 1.0 ( ci 0.711.0 ) , 1 ( ci 0.541.0 ) , and 0.77 ( ci 0.490.92 ) , respectively . the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , and npv of 1-hour ogtt for subsequent diagnosis of cfrd were 0.75 ( ci 0.40.92 ) , 1.0 ( ci 0.691.0 ) , 1 ( ci 0.591.0 ) , and 0.82 ( ci 0.520.95 ) , respectively .
finally , the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , and npv of 2-hour ogtt for the subsequent diagnosis of cfrd were 0.13 ( ci 0.030.48 ) , 1.0 ( ci 0.711.0 ) , 1 ( ci 0.151.0 ) , and 0.59 ( ci 0.350.78 ) , respectively .
there was a strong positive correlation between one - hour ogtt interpretation and that of cgm ( r = 0.77 , 95% ci 0.46 to 0.91 , p = 0.0003 ; not shown ) . in 5/6 ( 83% ) of the subjects for whom results differed between the two tests ,
