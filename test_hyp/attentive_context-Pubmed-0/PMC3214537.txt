pyogenic granuloma ( pg ) or granuloma pyogenicum is a well - known oral lesion .
the name pyogenic granuloma ( pg ) is a misnomer since the condition is not associated with pus and does not represent a granuloma histologically .
pg is a benign lesion ; therefore , surgical excision is the treatment of choice . to avoid the possibility of recurrence the lesion must be excised down to the underlying periosteum and predisposing irritant must be removed .
the gingiva is often the site of localized growths that are considered to be reactive rather than neoplastic in nature .
lasers have shown to be a successful option for the excision of pg with advantages of minimal pain and invasiveness and the lack of need for suturing or packing .
a 30-year - old systemically healthy male patient presented with a chief complaint of growth in the mouth involving lower - left back teeth region of the jaw .
many of these lesions are difficult to be identified clinically and can be identified as specific entity only on the basis of typical and consistent histomorphology .
the majority remains small and lesions more than 1 cm in diameter are rare on the cheeks , tongue , and floor of the mouth possibly because masticatory trauma restricts their size through necrosis and ulceration .
