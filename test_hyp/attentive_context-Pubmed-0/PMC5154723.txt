the purpose of this study was to determine whether eccentric training and vbt could be used together ( veb ) in a strength training program in track and field athletes to develop two critical characteristics of athletics : strength and power .
however , there were significant differences from pre - to - post - intervention within each training group . within the veb training group , there were significant increases in men s 1rm squat ( 166.55  35.74 to 177.73  34.80 kg ; figure 2a ) , men s vertical jump ( 73.63  12.67 to 75.83  12.37 cm ; figure 3a ) , and men s medicine ball put test ( 4.12  0.52 to 4.54
there were significant improvements in men s 1rm squat ( 154.55  9.46 to 176.71  15.89 kg ; figure 2a ) , and women s 1rm squat ( 104.63  23.76 to 123.89  24.80 kg ; figure 2b ) .
we hypothesized that by training the two programs of eccentric contraction and vbt together in one program ( veb ) , larger gains in both strength and power production would be made compared to a vbt program alone .
additionally , the moderate - to - low - intensity loads in vbt allows for less fatigue and quicker recovery , all - the - while - performance is still improving .
