it is not pathognomonic of hypothermia , but usually occurs in patients with a core temperature < 32 and the magnitude of the j point elevation correlates inversely with the body temperature.6 ) several studies have suggested an arrhythmogenic potential of the osborn wave,7)8)9)10 ) but there is no solid evidence that th - induced osborn wave itself is associated with increased mortality.11)12 ) here we report a case of recurrent ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) after appearance of osborn wave during mild th .
a 56-year - old man with no underlying disease was admitted to the emergency department with sudden cardiac arrest . while having breakfast , he suddenly pounded his chest .
has been used to improve neurological outcome in comatose patients after cardiac arrest.1)2 ) the exact mechanism for neuroprotection is unclear ; potential mechanisms include attenuation of deleterious processes occurring after initial hypoxic tissue injury.3)4)5 ) generally , mild hypothermia is defined as a core body temperature between 32 and 34.2 ) this is thought to be appropriate temperature between neuroprotective effects and possible toxicities . the osborn wave ( also known as the j wave )
hypothermia is also proarrhythmic and can cause lethal arrhythmias , especially at low temperature and in the presence of low serum ph.19 ) however , in our case , vf developed in normal serum ph , electrolyte levels , and not markedly low body temperature . therefore , vf and osborn wave seem not always to be related to body temperature , and individual variations in response to hypothermia can be more important to determine the vulnerability to arrhythmias . physicians need to monitor patient 's vital signs including core temperature , ecg , and laboratory tests carefully during th .
