animal studies are usually pursued as part of a reductionist approach aimed at controlling as many variables as possible in order to isolate mechanistic effects , but their interpretation and extrapolation to the clinical setting reminds us that in critical care , clinicians think of effects on different systems all together . carefully conducted studies such as this one counteract the nihilistic tendency to think that mechanisms are too complicated and thus only hard clinical endpoints in patients are of any value , and encourage the sort of integrative approach that makes progress possible .
as such , dopexamine has been tested in clinical trials to optimize hemodynamics , either in patients with shock or as part of a perioperative regimen .
use of dopexamine targeted to increase oxygen delivery to > 600 ml / minute / m , however , was shown in a randomized trial reported in 1993 to decrease mortality in the perioperative period . whether this resulted from differential hemodynamic effects of dopexamine compared with other agents , perhaps selective vasodilation of regional circulations , or whether use of inotropes for perioperative optimization is different from their use in other settings
the report in the previous issue of critical care by bangash and colleagues is one such study .
