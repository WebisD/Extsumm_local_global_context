thermostable -amylase , glucoamylase , glucose isomerase , and pullulanase were used to hydrolyze sweet potato starch into syrup with comparable , and in some instances superior nutritional , rheological and thermal properties to commercially available ginger and pancake syrups using the enzymes .
specifically , the study isomerized a high glucose spss and determined its sugar profile , mineral content , and rheological and thermal properties .
our study has added important information to the knowledge base regarding the rheological and thermal properties of the spss . additionally , the spss had significantly higher mineral content than the ginger and pancake syrups , making it a much more nutritious option .
overall , the results of this study demonstrated that the spss had higher mineral ( calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , iron , and potassium ) content when compared to the ginger and pancake syrups . in general ,
overall , the spss has the potential to be used in food systems in space and on earth .
the study was part of the larger cfesh and fpd project to convert raw crops such as sweet potatoes into ingredients and nutritious value - added food products for use in food systems in space and on earth .
