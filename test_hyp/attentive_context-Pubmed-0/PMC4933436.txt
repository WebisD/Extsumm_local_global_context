here , we analysed the pathology results further to identify cases of lethal solid tumors and applied a multistage mathematical model of carcinogenesis to the data13 in order to gain mechanistic insight into the protective effect of cr , specifically as it relates to radiation - induced cancers .
in fact , the levels of cr required to produce the greatest longevity effects in experimental animals are perhaps beyond what could be reasonably maintained by most people , and certainly would not be advised for children or young people during their developmental years.11 yet , understanding the kinetics of how cancer preventative / suppressive approaches can be instigated long after the time of irradiation affects the risk of radiation - induced cancer can help us to determine the utility of such approaches , and whether they can specifically prevent or merely offset radiation - induced cancer risk .
simple lifestyle changes which can be proven to help offset both spontaneous and radiation - induced risk might provide significant public health benefits , both in terms of decreased cancer burden and improved mental health and well - being .
seven weeks after 1-week - old mice were subjected to 3.8 gy irradiation , they were fed either a diet equivalent to their ad libitum calorie intake ( 95 kcal / mouse / week ) or switched to a nutritionally - balanced diet limited to approximately 1/3 fewer calories ( 65 kcal / mouse / week).12 the results showed that irradiation alone decreased tumor - free lifespan , cr alone increased tumor - free lifespan , and initiating cr after irradiation was able to partially mitigate radiation - induced cancer . separating the data by cause of death revealed that different tumor types / sites responded differently to cr , with radiation - induced lymphomas showing little to no response , while a clear effect could be seen for late - occurring solid tumors .
