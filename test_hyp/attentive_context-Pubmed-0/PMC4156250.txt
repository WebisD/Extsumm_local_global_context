rna - seq uses short 
 read sequencing technologies to sequence the rna content ( transcriptome 
 profile ) of a sample . on the basis of 
 the central dogma of molecular biology , it is a reasonable assumption 
 that proteins corresponding to high - abundance transcripts are more 
 likely to be found in a sample .
in this study , 
 we evaluate the utility of incorporating both of the above types of 
 information into proteomics analysis pipelines .
the global proteome machine database 
 ( gpmdb ) is a repository storing the results 
 of proteomics experiments . with the large volume of data aggregated 
 in gpmdb , the frequency of identification of a protein in gpmdb
can 
 be used as a surrogate measure of a protein s propensity to 
 be observed in a ms / ms experiment . in other words
, we can reasonably 
 assume that proteins with a high gpmdb identification frequency ( gpmfreq ) 
 are more likely to be identified in an ms / ms experiment .
another category of methods have 
 investigated utilizing external 
 information ( information from outside the ms / ms experiment ) such as 
 microarray data , protein 
the first step in a 
 typical computational pipeline for protein 
 identification through database searching is comparing ms / ms spectra 
 to peptide sequences to identify the best matching peptide for each 
 spectrum , referred to as peptide - to - spectrum matches ( psms ) .
