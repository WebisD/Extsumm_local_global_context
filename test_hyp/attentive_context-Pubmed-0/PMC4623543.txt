here , we report four new cases , all with the correlation of mri and punctuate bleeding .
posttraumatic avascular necrosis ( avn ) of the scaphoid is a common complication probably due to the precarious blood supply .
the diagnosis of avn of the scaphoid is made by combining the mri findings with direct observation of the punctuate bleeding during the operation .
however , the diagnosis of avn is suspicious in these cases , as mri investigation had been performed in one case   and preoperative bleeding was observed in the other .
careful review of the literature revealed six cases of distal avn in three studies   .
the series consisted of four patients aged 29 , 33 , 53 and 57 years .
so our fourth case seems to be a unique case of distal pole avn of the scaphoid in the literature .
, all these cases should be labeled as suspected avn . in three of our cases , although preoperative mri suggested avn ( figure 2 ) , punctuate bleeding was observed during the operation and all were treated by pinning and grafting and healed uneventfully . in those cases , the appearance of avn was probably due to the normal marrow of bone that has not been established yet , but bleeding was observed due to revascularition . in the remaining case , mri suggested avn along with lack of punctuate bleeding and scaphoid was excised and radial advancement osteotomy was performed . in conclusion , all six cases reported before   , and three of our cases that were treated by pinning and had healed , were not real avn or the diagnosis was doubtful .
