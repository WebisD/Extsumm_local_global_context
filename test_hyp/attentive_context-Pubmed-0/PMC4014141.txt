l. plumulosus are routinely used 
 in both acute and chronic toxicity tests for estuarine sediments . in acute ( 10 d ) tests , sediments are the only food source , whereas 
 during 28 day chronic toxicity tests , l. plumulosus are fed by an external uncontaminated food source 23 times 
 per week . if in natural systems , algae 
 originating in the water column are a preferred food source , these 
 tests do not accurately assess exposure to contamination , as both 
 tests overlook the influence of contamination originating in the water 
 column , and acute toxicity tests ignore ingestion pathways completely . 

enriched stable isotopes of hg species have 
 been used as a powerful tool to study hg cycling and uptake into freshwater 
 foodwebs . in this study , we applied the technique to identify trophic transfer 
 of hg species from live phytoplankton in water and sediment compartments 
 in estuarine benthic infauna .
bioaccumulation varies with feeding behavior , suggesting uptake pathways 
 in test organisms need careful investigation to relate to sediment 
 and water quality criteria .
microcosms were scaled down 
 from recommended conditions for culturing l. plumulosus , to minimize the quantity of enriched isotopes needed , but maintaining 
 recommended amphipod densities ( < 1.5 cm ) , sediment 
 depth ( 1 cm ) , and water conditions ( 20 ppt , 20 c , do > 4.4
