we report the imaging findings of a patient with paget 's disease in carcinoma lung who underwent during staging and follow - up imaging using f-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) .
a 65-year - old male patient diagnosed to have right lower lobe lung adenocarcinoma was referred for fdg pet / ct for staging evaluation .
paget 's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by focal areas of excessive osteoclastic resorption accompanied by a secondary increase in osteoblastic activity , resulting in abnormal bone structure , bone expansion , and deformity .
scintigraphy using either tc99m - methylene diphosphonate or fluorine-18 ( f-18 ) fluoride is the most useful method of detecting pagetic lesions .
follow - up imaging was helpful as lung primary and nodes were responding to the chemotherapy but the pelvic lesion remains same confirming unrelated to lung cancer as paget 's disease of pelvis .
the intense fdg focal uptake in the left hemipelvis lesion on fdg - pet in our case is a possibility of false positive findings in patients with cancer .
he underwent follow - up fdg pet - ct after three cycles of chemotherapy showed intense fdg uptake with decrease in size and metabolism of the lung primary and mediastinal nodes with complete response in supraclavicular and some mediastinal nodes . but left hemipelvis uptake remains same , and he was asymptomatic for paget 's disease [ figure 3 ] .
