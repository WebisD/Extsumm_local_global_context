the purpose of this study was to review the cases of ureteral injury during gynecologic surgeries in relation to possible predisposing factors and patient management according to the time of detection of the injury in our hospital from march 2006 to february 2011 .
the records of 35 patients ( 1.2% ) with 38 iatrogenic ureteral injuries sustained in a total of 2,927 gynecologic surgeries carried out from march 2006 to february 2011 in the department of obstetrics and gynecology in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed .
ureteral injuries were recognized intraoperatively in 20 patients and 1 to 28 days after the surgery in 15 patients .
unfortunately , patients with undiagnosed injuries can have a highly variable course that causes diagnostic delay , resulting in additional hospitalization that is associated with substantial morbidity and commonly results in medicolegal litigations .
laparotomy might be a better option for early detection and intraoperative repair of ureteral injury during gynecologic surgery when the patient has risk factors associated with ureteral injury .
the postoperative detection rate of ureteral injury was higher in laparoscopic surgery cases ( 73% ) than in laparotomy cases ( 29% ; p=0.027 ) ( table 2 ) .
