the aim of this study was to assess the influence of the quality of coronal restorations and root canal treatment ( separately and in concomitant ) on the periapical status of endodontically treated teeth from an adult syrian subpopulation .
the prevalence of periapical lesion in syrian subpopulation is high which indicate poor dental practice .
we randomly selected panoramic x - rays for patients attended dental school of damascus university who fulfill the selection criteria : patient 's age was set to be minimum of 19 years old , they had neither received any dental treatment for more than one year , nor had previously visited dental school clinics ( selected patients are private clinic patients ) .
thus , considerable efforts should be spent to improve the level of endodontic treatment and promote periradicular health .
illustrate the type of the teeth in the study and the adequacy of the final coronal restoration in the 459 teeth with adequate final restoration , the status of periapical tissues was healthy in 353 teeth ( 76.9% ) and diseased in 106 teeth ( 23.1% ) . in the 325 teeth with inadequate coronal restoration , the status of periapical tissues was healthy in 169 teeth ( 52% ) and diseased in 156 teeth ( 48% ) [ table 2 ] .
