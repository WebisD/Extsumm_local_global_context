. there is , therefore , a need to ensure continued research into endocrine disruption and to establish pragmatic ways of bringing chemicals of concern under tighter controls .
. meetings of the organisation for economic co - operation and development task force on endocrine disrupters testing and assessment are instrumental in deciding which test methods should be prioritized for development and international validation and harmonization .
in conclusion , endocrine disruption is likely to be affecting more than the couple of hundred or so species currently suspected or known to be affected
may also cause transgenerational effects ( effects carried across generations as a consequence of events that happen during the lifetime of the previous generation ) .
furthermore , to counterbalance the vested interest of industry and to help policymakers consider all aspects , independent scientists should be encouraged to work not only on pure scientific research but also at the science / policy interface .
endocrine - disrupting contaminants pose an insidious threat because exposure in early life during development can lead to subtle irreversible organizational effects that may be masked until the offspring reach maturity . some chemicals with endocrine - disrupting properties
wwf maintains that to protect biodiversity , we need regulatory frameworks worldwide to prevent the use of chemicals with properties that cause much concern , certainly where safer alternatives exist .
