the aim of the present study was to evaluate the change of leptin concentration in peripheral blood in patients with agp , and to explore the relationship between leptin and systemic inflammation markers .
as far as we knew , this study provided the first evidence about the positive association between plasma leptin levels and systemic inflammatory markers including wbc and neutrophil counts , il-1 and il-6 in patients with agp .
elevated plasma leptin concentration was associated with increased systemic levels of inflammatory markers , especially il-1 and il-6 , in agp patients after controlling for age , gender , and bmi .
although numerous research have investigated the serum leptin levels in patients with gingivitis and cp , few evidence is present about that in patients with agp , which is a distinct form of periodontitis and characterized by early onset and rapid and severe periodontal destruction , as well as its relationship with systemic inflammatory markers .
, significantly higher wbc and neutrophil counts were observed in the agp group ; the alb and a / g were significantly lower in the agp group than in the control group ( p < 0.01 ) .
the relationship between the levels of plasma leptin and inflammatory cytokines ( controlling for age , gender and bmi ) * p < 0.05 ; p < 0.01 .
