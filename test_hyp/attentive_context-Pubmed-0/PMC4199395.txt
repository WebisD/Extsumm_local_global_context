early stratifications of patients into low- and high - risk groups with timely and tailored empiric antimicrobial therapy can improve the prognosis of patients with fn .
, we analyzed the clinical factors predictive of poor outcomes in patients with chemotherapy - induced fn at initial patient evaluation in the ed .
cells / mm ( or 3.90 , 95% ci 1.629.43 ) , pulmonary infiltration ( or 3.45 , 95% ci 1.488.07 ) , hypoproteinemia < 6g / dl ( or 3.30 , 95% ci 1.278.56 ) , respiratory rate > 24/min ( or 8.75 , 95% ci 2.1835.13 ) , and mascc risk - index score < 21 ( or 9.20 , 95% ci 3.9821.26 ) were determined to be independent risk factors for death ( table 7 ) .
these risk factors were predictive of serious complications with sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , and negative predictive value ( npv ) of 81% , 78% , 81% , and 79% , respectively .
univariate analyses of the clinical parameters available from the ed and mascc scoring system were performed ( table 4 ) . in the multiple logistic regression analysis , a platelet count < 50 000 cells / mm ( or 3.93 , 95% ci 1.4210.92 ) , serum crp > 50 mg / dl ( or 3.80 , 95% ci 1.688.61 ) , hypoproteinemia ( or 7.81 , 95% ci 3.4317.78 ) , egfr 90 ml / min/1.73 m ( or 3.06 , 95% ci 1.138.26 ) , and mascc risk - index score < 21 ( or 3.45 , 95% ci 1.537.79 ) were determined to be independent risk factors for the prediction of poor clinical outcomes of fn patients admitted to the ed ( table 5 ) .
