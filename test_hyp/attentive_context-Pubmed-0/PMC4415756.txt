the point that we want to emphasize in our study is ; it ca nt be ignored that muscle weakness mechanisms developing in the thigh circumference vary according to the thigh muscle group and knee flexors play an important role in thigh atrophy when determining an appropriate rehabilitation program after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction application .
, we planned to evaluate the effect of thigh circumference difference between operated extremity and intact extremity on knee flexorsmuscle strength .
after our study , in accordance with our findings it is still possible to encounter the thigh atrophy in average 28 months after acl reconstruction surgery even under physical rehabilitation programs and appropriate follow - up . in line with earlier studies , quadriceps muscle mass
statistically significant relationship was observed at the level of 66.0% percent between the thigh diameter difference and cybex extension 60 of patients in negative direction ( while the thigh diameter difference increasing the cybex extension 60 percent decreasing ) ( r : 0,660 ; p=0.001 ; p<0.01 ) .
in our study , we aimed to evaluate the effect of thigh circumference difference between patients knees who were administered the acl reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft and intact knees , on torque between the hamstring and quadriceps muscles .
