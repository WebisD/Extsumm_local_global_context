this paper concentrates on protein glycosylation in a. fumigatus , which will be discussed with respect to the enzymatic pathways involved and their functional importance .
therefore , investigation of glycosylation in the multicellular fungus a. fumigatus not only helps understand the mechanism of cell wall synthesis in this species but also provides insights into the role of glycosylation in the development of multicellular eukaryotes .
although investigation of the model yeast has been very useful in elucidating the biochemical features of protein glycosylation at the cellular level , they can not reveal the complicated functions of glycosylation in the development of multicellular eukaryotes .
furthermore , the utility of a. fumigatus as a model for glycosylation during development of multicellular eukaryotes will be outlined .
our knowledge of protein glycosylation comes mainly from investigation of the model yeast s. cerevisiae and of mammalian cells .
therefore , a more profound understanding of the mechanisms of cell wall biosynthesis in a. fumigatus would help to improve the efficiency of drug therapies , especially for drugs which target the cell wall .
it is now known that carbohydrates play increasingly important roles in regulating the development of higher organisms . however , the mechanism by which carbohydrates play a role in development and disease is still unclear .
