  the study of the evolution of sex - biased herbivory is hampered by the notion that male - biased herbivory in dioecious species is a rule .
sexual systems in angiosperms range from hermaphroditism ( monomorphic populations of plants with bisexual flowers ) to dioecy ( dimorphic populations of male and female individuals ) and include almost all imaginable combinations and gradations ( table 1 ;   and references therein ) . such remarkable diversity of sexual systems has perplexed naturalists and evolutionary biologists for a long time   . the evolution of dioecy from a hermaphroditic ancestor has been particularly difficult to understand because the invasion and maintenance of unisexual mutants in a population of hermaphrodites require that the loss of fitness resulting from the loss of one sexual function be compensated by increased fitness gains through the remaining sexual function of the unisexual mutant   .
therefore , future studies of herbivory in dioecious species should be based on a clear theoretical framework . in particular , we urge that all new studies of herbivory in dioecious species include assessments of reproductive allocation , growth rates , and resistance traits deemed to differ between sexes and , therefore , determine sex - biased herbivory .
