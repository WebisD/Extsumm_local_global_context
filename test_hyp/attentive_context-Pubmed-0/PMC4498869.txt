deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) is a neurosurgical technique aimed at improving  functional  neurologic disorders . to facilitate intraoperative neurophysiologic microelectrode recording ( mer ) and neurocognitive testing of the eloquent parts of the brain , dbs
an awake and cooperative patient with fully preserved brain function is essen - tial during mer to ensure accurate lead placement 1,2 .
our case involved a developmentally delayed 24-year old , 80-kg male with traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) as an infant with resultant post - traumatic stroke , hydrocephalus , and right upper extremity hemidystonia , causing a prominent dystonic flexor position at the elbow .
is commonly performed via an  awake  approach under a local anesthetic and conscious sedation . while a deeper plane of anesthesia can be used during the portion of the procedure not involved in testing ,
while dbs is most commonly performed for generalized dystonias , there are few reports in the literature describing dbs for tbi - induced dystonias . here , we have presented a case of dbs in an awake patient with post - traumatic hemidystonia . although various anesthetic techniques and combinations of drugs have been described for an awake craniotomy , dexmedetomidine appears to be useful in procedures , involving dbs and neurophysiologic monitoring . as the indications for dbs in the pediatric patient population are expanding and the demand for this procedure increases , the creation and implementation of standardized protocols guiding the complex anesthetic management for these cases would be of value .
