to our knowledge , this is the first study to assess the perception of incidence and survival rates of eight common cancers and total cancer in the korean general population .
this study was conducted to explore the perception of cancer incidence rates and the survivability of cancer among the general population .
when we considered the accurate estimation rate in the range of 5% that focused on actual incidence of specific cancers ( except 0% ) , most respondents overestimated lifetime cancer incidence rates ( e.g. , men : stomach cancer , 80.7% ; lung cancer , 70.6% ; and prostate cancer , 85.9% ; women : stomach cancer , 93.0% ; lung cancer , 88.0% ; breast cancer , 82.0% ; and cervical cancer , 92.8% ) .
the actual lifetime cumulative incidence rates of total cancer , based on an analysis of cancer statistics in south korea from 2011 , are 38.1% in men and 33.8% in women . defining accurate estimation rate as in the range of 5% of the actual incidence of total cancers ( men , 33.1%-43.1% ; women , 28.8%-38.8% ) , only 19% of men and women came close to this actual incidence rate .
