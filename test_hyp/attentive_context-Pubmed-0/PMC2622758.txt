data on period concatenation of gamma and beta2 rhythms into a beta1 frequency rhythm reveal a combination of features seen in previously described frequency interactions and transformations : firstly , concatenation stabilises the phase relationship between the gamma and beta2 generating networks  a phenomenon critical to the establishment of phase synchrony . secondly
, the periodicity of both component networks is still manifest in the pattern of synaptic interaction between individual neurons , as seen for single , gamma - generating networks producing beta rhythms as a subharmonic .
period concatenation constitutes a robust mechanism for interaction between the many discrete frequencies of rhythm observable in neocortical networks .
an advantage of this process is that , as the state of the cortical network is stable , rhythms that may perhaps occur only transiently in vivo can be generated constantly for many hours in vitro  thus facilitating detailed quantification and dissection of underlying mechanisms , which can then be used to further understand network dynamics using mathematical and computational models .
this multi - scale dynamic feature of cortical rhythms may be vital for cortical information processing ( palva et al . , 2005 ) , with interactions between frequency bands being as important as the individual frequencies themselves  a phenomenon termed spectral processing .
