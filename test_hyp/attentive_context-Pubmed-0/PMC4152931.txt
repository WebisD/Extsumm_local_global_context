comparing men mcpc negative with those mcpc positive using the epstein criteria   for active surveillance , 38/42 ( 91% ) of mcpc negative men compared with 34/286 ( 12% ) ( p < 0.0001 ) of mcpc positive men complied with the criteria for active surveillance of their prostate cancer ( table 2 ) .
we present the results of 328 men diagnosed with prostate cancer as a result of a screening program and compare the results of primary mcpc detection with the biopsy gleason score , percent of infiltration of the samples by cancer , and the number of positive cores .
the results suggest that the majority of cancers that the test failed to detect , when used as a sequential screening test in men with a psa level of between 4.0 and 10.0  ng / ml , are low grade small volume tumors which would comply with the criteria for active observation .
the use of the detection of primary mcpcs as a sequential test to select men , with suspicion of prostate cancer for an elevated psa , to determine the need for prostate biopsy raised concern of the possibility of missing clinically significant prostate cancer .
