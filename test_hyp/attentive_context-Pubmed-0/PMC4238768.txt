 evaluation of delayed toxicity and influence of the blood feeding state 
 - the ld50 values for the susceptible ( s ) and resistant ( r ) 
 populations were 5.2 ( 3.4 - 7.8 ) and 9.2 ( 7.4 - 11.2 ) ng / insect , respectively , and did not 
 differ up to 72 h after the initial topical application .
this is the first study of the efficacy of several formulations of imidacloprid on 
 different surfaces against susceptible and pyrethroid - resistant t. 
 infestans . in an attempt to characterise the toxicology of imidacloprid against t. 
 infestans
, the development of pyrethroid - resistant populations 
 has led to the re - utilisation of either malathion or fenitrothion against triatomines by 
 the health authorities of argentina and bolivia .
. a spot - on formulation 
 appears to improve this interaction , resulting in increased mortality of the triatomine 
 vector in the laboratory .
, we studied the variation in mortality through time after topical 
 application and the influence of the blood feeding condition of the insect on this 
 toxicity .
these insecticides were used to control t. infestans in the 70 s , but 
 because of their high toxicity in mammals , strong odour and tendency to leave stains on 
 the walls after application they were replaced by pyrethroids in the 80 s ( schofield & dias 1999 ) .
