, the authors describe a case of ectopic anterosuperior mediastinal thyroid mass excised through a cervical incision and the subsequent investigation to exclude malignancy .
an 80-year - old nonsmoker female patient presented with an incidental finding of a mediastinal mass on mri scan for investigation of vertigo ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
a lingual thyroid is the most common presentation of thyroid ectopy   along with thyroglossal duct remnants .  
, the authors suggest that abnormally situated thyroid tissue , other than that in the central neck along the path of embryological descent of the thyroid gland , should be excised for careful histological analysis in order to exclude metastatic disease .
ectopic thyroid tissue is a common abnormality and results from abnormal embryologic development and migration of the thyroid gland .
such tissue is usually found along the path of descent of the thyroid gland in the anterior midline of the neck .
ectopic thyroid tissue has been described in other parts of the head and neck such as the submandibular   and parotid salivary glands .
the authors therefore conclude that this represents developmentally ectopic sequestered thyroid tissue in the anterior mediastinum . despite this
the most frequent noncervical location for ectopic thyroid tissue is the thoracic cavity   .
