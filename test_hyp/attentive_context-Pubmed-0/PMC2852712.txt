however , histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings suggested that the gastric tumor was a metastatic adenocarcinoma originated from a distal cholangiocarcinoma .
a 67-year - old woman presented with a 4-month history of abdominal pain after meals .
although it comprises only 10 - 15% of all hepatobiliary neoplasms , its incidence is increasing.1 frequent metastatic sites of biliary cancer are the liver , peritoneum , intra - abdominal lymph nodes , and lungs.2 here , we describe a very rare case in which metastatic cholangiocarcinoma of the stomach was mistaken for primary gastric cancer in a patient who underwent whipple 's operation .
another important immunohistochemical marker , cdx-2 is a very useful marker to distinguish stomach cancers from bile duct cancers , because cdx-2 expression is reported to be positive in 61% of stomach cancer cases but only in 13% of bile duct cancers , however cdx-2 was not performed in our study.7 until now , unusual metastastic sites from cholangiocarcinoma were reported to be the colon , adrenal gland , skull bone , epididymis , corneal limbus , meninges , ovary , skeletal musle , and skin.2,8 - 15 metastasis of a distal cholangiocarcinoma to the stomach has not been reported previously to our knowledge but , as in the above - mentioned sites , appears to be a rare site of metastasis of this tumor . in conclusion , a careful histopathologic and immunohistochemical review is very important in diagnostic differentiation of metastatic tumors from primary sites in this case .
