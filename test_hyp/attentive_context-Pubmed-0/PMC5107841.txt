preclinical tolerance protocols should encompass mhag disparities to reflect the clinical setting and need to induce mechanisms capable of durable tolerization of donor mhag .
in this study we provide evidence that mhag disparities play a decisive role in the induction and maintenance of tolerance in recipients conditioned with nonmyeloablative bmt and cb , in which mhag both impede the engraftment of bm and promote the rejection of donor skin in successfully established mixed chimeras .
this study reveals that mhag disparities have a negative impact on bm engraftment and tolerance maintenance in a nonmyeloablative , cb - based chimerism model .
humoral immunity to specific mhag , such as antibodies to angiotensin type 1 receptor ( at1r ) and endothelin type a receptor ( etar ) , have been shown to correlate with an increased incidence of acute rejection and inferior long - term graft survival in kidney and heart allografts .
therefore , we investigated different donor host strain combinations displaying mhc mismatches only ( either h2 or h2 ) or mhc plus multiple mhag mismatches ( h2 ) .
concluding , the type of mhc ( i.e. i - e versus i - e ) may influence the extent and kinetic of deletion of donor - reactive t cells .
