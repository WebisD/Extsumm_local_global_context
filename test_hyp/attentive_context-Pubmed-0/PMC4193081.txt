the data presented in this article and the findings of the evaluation indicate that the rural hospital swing - bed program has been working as might have been anticipated : swing - beds have assumed the provision of a significant portion of post - acute care services in many states with large rural areas .
the post - acute case mix in swing - bed hospitals represent more short term , intense level of care requirements than those in snfs .
swing - bed hospitals seem better suited to meeting nursing care needs of these types of patients than do rural snfs , which seem more suited to meeting the needs of the traditional long - term care nursing home patients .
higher average total charges per day for swing - bed patients suggest that they tend to be more expensive to care for than are the patients in snfs ; especially in the use of ancillary services . per diem reimbursements for swing - bed services have been growing at an average annual rate of about one - third of that for snfs . the latter finding raises question as to whether the current basis for reimbursing for post - acute routine care services in swing - bed hospitals causes per diem revenues to rise at a slower rate than per diem costs .
