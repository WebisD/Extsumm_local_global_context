, we compare four important epidemiological and virological characteristics of influenza a and b in 26 countries : the proportion of influenza b over all influenza cases ; the community impact of influenza b ; the frequency of influenza b vaccination mismatches ; and the age distribution of influenza a and b cases .

the global influenza b study ( gibs ) was launched in 2012 with the main aim of collecting information on the epidemiology and global burden of disease of influenza b during the past 1015  years , to support future prevention policies .

studies in the united states have shown that the frequent influenza b vaccine mismatches of recent years have been associated with substantial increases in cases , hospitalizations and deaths ( up to annual 970  000 cases , with 8200 hospitalizations and 485 deaths , in the usa),10 as well as with large influenza - related medical costs , and costs associated with productivity loss.11 despite the important role of influenza b , much of the published scientific literature regarding the epidemiology of influenza has focused on influenza a , and we still have a relatively poor understanding of global epidemiology and burden of disease of influenza b , especially outside europe and the united states.8 several studies have reported on the burden of disease attributable to influenza b in a single season , or during consecutive seasons in a single country,12,13 but only one study thus far has looked at the global epidemiology of influenza b.4 in particular , it is very important to assess the epidemiology of influenza in the tropics , as this is where approximately 40% of the world s population live,14 and influenza activity there is quite different from other world regions15,16 : countries in the tropics may experience two annual peaks , and epidemics are not as short and intense as in the northern and southern hemispheres.1719 these differences can have important implications for effective and evidence - based decisions regarding the composition and period of administration of influenza vaccines .
