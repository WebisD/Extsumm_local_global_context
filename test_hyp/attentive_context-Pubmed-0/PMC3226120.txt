animal models utilizing human recombinant activated factor vii ( rfviia ; novoseven ; novo nordisk a / s , bagsvrd , denmark ) are limited by interspecies differences in terms of coagulation molecule interactions . the interaction between tissue factor and factor
the dose of rfviia needed for effect varies substantially between animal species , including the dog ( 60 g / kg ) , rabbit ( 2 mg / kg ) , and mouse ( 10 mg / kg ) .
therefore , changes in coagulation parameters seen with the use of human rfviia in animals may not correlate with hemostatic end - points . because of these interspecies differences with regard to human rfviia activity , minimal conclusions concerning optimal dosing in humans can be drawn from animal experiments . in pharmacologic models
both rabbit and human thromboplastin induce coagulation more efficiently in human plasma than in swine plasma .
the efficacy of reversing a bolus of low - molecular - weight heparin ( lmwh ) was studied in a rabbit ear puncture model .
the efficacy and safety of rfviia has been demonstrated in multiple small and large animal models .
this group of patients includes those extremely ill individuals with the lethal triad of hypothermia , coagulopathy , and acidosis who are on pressor therapy .
