the aim of this study was to explore the vascular and cardiac changes of opg and trail in experimental models of dyslipidemia and diabetes .
, we hypothesized that dyslipidemia and diabetes , which are two well known risk factors for cvd , could modify the vascular and cardiac expression of opg and trail , leading to an increased opg / trail ratio at a tissue level .
, we evaluated the effects of dyslipidemia , alone and in combination with diabetes , on aortic and cardiac opg and trail expression and found that while diabetes is the major determinant of opg / trail tissue changes in the vessels , dyslipidemia is it in the heart .
circulating opg was 1.91  0.21  ng / ml in the control group , 2.05  0.1  ng / ml in the apoe group , and 3.1  0.19 in the apoe + dm group , such that opg increased significantly in diabetic mice as compared to the other groups ( p < 0.05 , apoe + dm versus cnt and versus apoe group ) .
as for cardiac changes , dyslipidemia was associated with a significant increase in cardiomyocyte size ( figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) ) , indicating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , with no further increase after the induction of diabetes . in the aorta , the induction of diabetes was associated with a significant increase in opg gene expression and in the opg / trail ratio , while dyslipidemia had no effect on opg / trail ratio as compared to controls ( figure 2(a ) ) . by contrast , in the heart , dyslipidemia was the major determinant of opg / trail tissue changes , not only by increasing opg but also by reducing trail gene expression .
