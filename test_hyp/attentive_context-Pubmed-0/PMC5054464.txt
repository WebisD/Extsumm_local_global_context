however , further characteristics of fhh3 patients need to be performed in order to clarify whether fhh3 is indeed associated with a more severe course , as well as whether there is any correlation to neuroendocrine tumors . in conclusion , we have reported the first case with cooccurrence of fhh3 and a net in the distal ilium . although our index case was most likely a phenocopy , resembling an atypical men1like syndrome , we believe that further attention should be paid to whether fhh3 may be associated with other endocrine tumors . furthermore , our cases underline the importance of considering fhh3 in families with hyperparathyroid hypercalcemia , including patients with a clinical suspicion of men1 who are mutationnegative , as this may spare patients for the worry of being diagnosed with a cancer susceptibility syndrome and ptx .
we now report a family with fhh3 among whom two brothers had ptx performed due to suspected phpt with one of the brothers having a concomitant diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor ( net ) .
familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia ( fhh ) is a heterogenic , autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by hypercalcemia with ( relative ) hyperparathyroidism , and hypocalciuria 1 .
