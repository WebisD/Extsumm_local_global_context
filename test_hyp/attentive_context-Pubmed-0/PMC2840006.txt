the high frequency of supernormal eogs in patients with nf-1 suggests that this type of analysis might be useful in the initial identification of patients with nf-1 who do not present with the typical spectrum of disease symptoms .
our initial eog   results suggested that dysfunction of the rpe may be a characteristic feature of individuals with nf-1 . in order to verify our preliminary findings we performed the eog examination in a two - fold larger group of patients diagnosed with nf-1 .
the student t - test and the mann - whitney test revealed significant differences in the variables dta ( p < 0.001 ) , ai ( p < 0.001 ) , and lpl ( p < 0.001 ) .
eog in nf-1 patients - descriptive statistics and statistical analysis ( 36 patients ) n - number of eyes ; m - arithmetic mean ; min - minimum value ; med - median ; n - normal distribution ; sd - standard deviation ; max - maximum value * * * - p < 0.001 for the nf-1 group , the mean dta ( 305.0  81.2 v ) was significantly lower than that of the control group ( 408.1  112.9 v ) and the mean ai ( 3.42  0.62 ) was significantly higher ( 2.45  0.37 ) .
