culicoides spp . latreille ( diptera : ceratopogonidae ) or biting midges are small ( 0.5 - 2.0 mm in length ) bloodsucking insects that have a broad distribution and impact on human and veterinary health as vectors of viruses ( bluetongue , african horse sickness , epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer , akabane , aino , chuzan , and bovine ephemeral fever viruses ) , protozoan parasites ( haemoproteus and leucocytozoon spp . ) , and filarial worms ( onchocerca and dipetalonema spp . ) throughout their range [ 1 - 15 ] .
vector - borne disease surveillance is conducted by the 65th medical brigade in collaboration with the public health command region - pacific ( phcr - pac ) to determine the species composition and seasonal and geographical distributions for mosquitoes and other biting flies , e.g. , culicoides spp . , and pathogens they harbor using mosquito magnet traps in / near the demilitarized zone ( dmz ) that separates north and south korea in northern gyeonggi - do , rok .
this is the first report for collections of culicoides using mosquito magnet traps that use only heat and co2 as attractants .
the first nationwide biting midge surveys in the republic of korea ( rok ) were reported in 1974 , with seasonal abundance and host blood meal analysis of culicoides spp . collected from cattle and poultry farms in gyeonggi - do ( province )
