to this aim , in the present study we evaluated whether chabazite / phillipsite / analcime , tipical zeolites of the central - souther of italy , may affect the levels of gsh peroxidase , sod , gsh reductase and tas in a group of clinically healthy men , both non - smokers and smokers .
in the present study we observed that 4-weeks chabazite / phillipsite / analcime intake in clinically healthy subjects , both non - smokers and smokers , increased the levels of gsh peroxidase , sod and gsh reductase , three antioxidant enzymes able to remove ros , and decreased tbars , a major indicator of lipid peroxidation utilized for monitoring oxidative stress , thus preventing or slowing down oxidative damage .
differently from t0 , instead , a major increased in gsh reductase levels was observed in non - smoking compared to smoking subjects ( 94.98    20.17  u / ml 
gsh peroxidase , gsh reductase and sod resulted increased compared to basal levels , both considering all subjects as joint and after subdivision in the two sub - groups , non - smokers and smokers ( table  1 and fig .  1 ) .
the mechanisms mediating zeolites antioxidant effects are not fully understood and since orally - administered zeolites are not absorbed into the blood it is possible that their in vivo effect may be due to an indirect interaction with biochemical systems , such as toxin and biological waste removal from the gut , activation of the immune system via the mucosal associated intestinal lymphoid tissue and also by increasing the bioavailability of mineral elements , which are important co - factors for the enzymes . in conclusion , our results strongly indicated that chabazite / phillipsite / analcime may help to counteract the effects of oxidative stress by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reducing oxidative stress in apparently healthy subjects exposed to different risk factors of oxidative stress .
