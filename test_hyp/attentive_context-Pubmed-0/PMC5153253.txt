other sources of information that could reflect increased bronchial obstruction could be the symptoms of the patient , as well as chest findings and assessment of oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) by pulse oximetry .
predicted values were 87.5 and 83.0 and among the copd patients , 61.2 and 54.7 .
the difficulties in interpreting auscultation findings also relate to crackles and prolonged expiration , which were stronger indicators of a drop in fev1 than wheezes in this study . to ask primary care patients with asthma or copd exacerbations about wheezing seems to be a simple and a rational approach when assessing change in lung function .
the aim of this study was to describe how these clinical findings are associated with a decrease in lung function during exacerbations .
have shown that each year ~50% of copd patients experience an exacerbation that leads to a visit to a general practitioner ( gp ) , in - hospital treatment , or self - administered treatment with antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids.1,2 in a study from the united states , ~25% of asthma patients reported to use a short course with oral corticosteroids during a period of 3 months.3 treatment with systemic corticosteroids is recommended in both severe copd exacerbations4,5 and asthma attacks.6,7 such medication counteracts the inflammatory response in the bronchial tree , and by doing so , alleviates the accompanying bronchial obstruction . in asthma attacks ,
