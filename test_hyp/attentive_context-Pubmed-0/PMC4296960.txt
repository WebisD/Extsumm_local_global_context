the primary purpose of the current study was to provide clinicians with efficacy results that would allow a comparison of duloxetine 60 mg / day with four approved ssris in japan .
results of the hamd17 subscale analysis indicated that duloxetine might be superior to ssris in improving loss of energy and interest .
comparison between duloxetine and ssri demonstrated comparable efficacy within the japan - approved dose range in patients with mdd .
for the more severe subgroup with hamd17 total scores 19 at baseline , again statistically significant differences were found in mean change in hamd17 total scores at week 8 , but greater efficacy for duloxetine was seen with the bech , maier , and retardation subscale scores compared with ssris : hamd17 bech ( 0.62   ) , hamd17 maier ( 0.65   ) , and hamd17 retardation ( 0.45   ) . in the total population , hamd17 total score effect sizes for duloxetine and ssri versus placebo were comparable ( 0.260 and 0.256 , respectively ) .
no statistically significant differences were found at week 8 for the duloxetine - treated versus ssri - treated patients ( or 1.11 ; 95% ci 0.641.92 ) , the duloxetine - treated versus placebo - treated patients ( or 1.53 ; 95% ci 0.743.18 ) , or the ssri - treated versus placebo - treated patients ( or 1.60 ; 95% ci 0.773.33 ) .
