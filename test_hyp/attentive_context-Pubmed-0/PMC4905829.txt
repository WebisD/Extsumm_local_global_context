also , in the olfactory organs of soft - shelled 
 turtles , the upper and lower chamber epithelia seem to be the olfactory organs that function 
 in the air and under water , respectively .
the bowman s glands are formed , the amount and size of the secretory granules increase , and 
 their electron - density and lectin - binding patterns change in the supporting cells of the oe 
   .
as we demonstrated in this study , the supporting cells contained secretory granules both in 
 the upper chamber epithelium and lower chamber epithelium in the nasal cavity of 
 soft - shelled turtles .
in addition to the differences in staining patterns for pas and ab or in the 
 electron - density , the secretory granules in the bowman s glands showed different binding 
 patterns to lectins from the patterns of the supporting cells in the upper and lower chamber 
 epithelia .
considering the 
 lubricating ability as one of the indices for olfactory functions , differences in the 
 olfactory function are suggested by the differences in the amount and properties of 
 secretory granules between the upper and lower chamber epithelia in the olfactory organ of 
 soft - shelled turtles . in general ,
