in this report , we describe the results of a genome - wide association scan in the gokind collection to identify loci associated with risk of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes .
third , although the locations of the variants confirmed in this study implicate both frmd3 and cars as novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy , the underlying mechanisms of disease of these associations need to be elucidated . and , finally ,
although confirmation in dcct / edic has been achieved for variations near frmd3 and cars , additional cohorts , particularly non - caucasian , would be useful to further characterize the pathogenic role of these , and other , candidate genes identified in the gokind collection .
analysis of time to onset of severe nephropathy confirmed the significant associations with diabetic nephropathy in gokind for rs1888746 ( frmd3 , p = 0.02 ) , rs13289150 ( frmd3 , p = 0.05 ) , and rs451041 ( cars , p = 0.01 ) .
although the biology underlying these associations remains to be elucidated , they implicate chn2/cpvl , frmd3 , cars , and an intergenic region on chromosome 13q as novel genes / genetic regions involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
