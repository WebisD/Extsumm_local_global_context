the complications observed were discitis and dural tear in five patients each and nerve root injury in two patients .
we report a series of 300 patients operated for lumbar dissectomy by destandau endospine system .
there is also a need to establish cadaveric labs and dummy models on line of arthroscopic learning centers where surgeons can practice hands - on cadavers and models to improve triangulation , depth perception , and hand eye coordination .
based on modified macnab 's criteria , 90% patients had excellent to good , 8% had fair , and 2% had poor results .
90% patients were able to return to light and sedentary work with an average delay of 3 weeks and normal physical activities after 2 months .
a total of 300 patients suffering from lumbar disc herniations were operated between january 2002 and december 2008 .
the results were evaluated by macnab 's criteria after a minimum followup of 12 months and maximum up to 24 months .
many studies have not been reported in literature for lumbar discectomy by destandau endospine system .
the overall results of standard discectomy range from 68 to 95% in different series.8 the operative microscope and microsurgical techniques were developed in mid-1960 's by yasargil and krayenbuhl910 and these techniques revolutionized spine surgery leading to smaller incisions , less blood loss , increased visualization of site of pathology , decreased hospitalization , shorter postoperative recovery , and earlier return to activities compared with previous operative interventional techniques .
