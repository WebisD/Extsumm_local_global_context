the present study aims to find the frequency of cyclin d1 overexpression and the relationship between cyclin d1 overexpression and some well - known clinicopathologic prognostic determinants in breast invasive ductal carcinoma .
the reverse relationship between cyclin d1 overexpression and tumor grade as well as the positive relationship between the overexpression of this marker and hormone receptor status in breast carcinoma suggest a regulatory role of cyclin d1 overexpression in cell maturation and differentiation .
the relationship between cyclin d1 and estrogen receptor a statistically significant relationship was found between cyclin d1 and pr ( p = 0.0001 ) .
the relationship between cyclin d1 and tumor grade the relationship between cyclin d1 and er was also statistically significant ( p = 0.0001 ) .
cyclin d1 was strong ( s ) , intermediate ( i ) , weak ( w ) and negative
the s , i and w states were mostly seen in patients with positive pr while the n status was most frequent in patients with negative pr [ table 3 ] . the relationship between cyclin d1 and progesterone receptor
however , overexpression of her2-neu has been reported to be associated with the high expression of cyclin d1 .
