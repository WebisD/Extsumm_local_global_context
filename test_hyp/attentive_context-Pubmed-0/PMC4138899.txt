this narrative review was conducted to understand the existing literatures on relationship between diabetes and suicide . we aimed at reviewing the literature on rates of occurrence of suicidal ideas and attempts in patients with diabetes , the risk factors for suicidality , the common and unique methods for suicidal attempts in such patients , and management of such patients .
suicidal thoughts and behaviors are a clinical and public health challenge in patients with dm . there are studies to suggest that dm is associated with greater frequency of suicidal thoughts and attempts , though there are a couple of studies which report to the contrary . the standardized mortality ratio due to suicide seems to be higher for patients with dm .
regular screening for suicidal ideas and appropriate psychiatric management of the symptoms can help in reducing potentially fatal outcomes .
easy access to lethal means in the form of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents seems to make attempt easy .
many studies have focused on the relationship that dm shares with psychiatric disorders , especially depressive disorder .
the two commonest forms of the disorder , diabetes type i ( t1 dm ) and type ii ( t2 dm ) have different pathophysiological mechanisms .
