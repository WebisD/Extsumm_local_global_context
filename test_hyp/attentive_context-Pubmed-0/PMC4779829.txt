the prevalence of gangrene in patients with higher treatment compliance was 68.1% , rising to 92.8% in less compliant individuals ( morisky scores 0 or 1 ; wagner grade 4 ) .
the risk of foot amputation for patients who had received conservative treatment was 63% lower than for those with a previous amputation ( p < 0.001 ; table 5 ) , while for individuals previously treated with antibiotics the risk of foot amputation was 42% higher than for patients not subjected to this drug therapy ( p = 0.026 ) .
glucose levels below 11.09  mmol / l at admission are associated with lower morbidity and mortality , and proper glycemic control is a critical factor for the infection eradication and ulcer healing .
implemented in a preventive manner , these two measures can significantly reduce lower limb amputation in patients with diabetes .
compliance with treatment was poor in 72% of patients ( score 2 for 35 individuals , score 3 for 15 , and score 4 for 15 ) , while 27 were considered compliant ( score 0 for 23 patients and score 1 for five ) .
the present findings show that limb amputation outcomes were strongly lowered by conservative treatment and compliance with diabetes drug therapy .
