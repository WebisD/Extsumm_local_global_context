, this study evaluated the microhardness of the resin 
 cement variolink ii along the cement line in the cervical , medium and 
 occlusal thirds on the buccal and lingual aspects , and on the occlusal surface , when 
 used for luting ceramic crowns on different substrates ( dentin , metal , and composite 
 resin ) , after 7 days and 3 months of water storage .
based on the results , the following could be concluded : there was no significant difference in the microhardness results between the cervical , 
 medium , and occlusal thirds and occlusal surface ; there was significant difference in the microhardness results between substrates . for 
 the 7-day storage period , the results of the composite resin substrate were lower than 
 dentin and metal .
after 3 months of storage , the results were similar for the 3 
 substrates ; the type of material employed for coronal reconstruction of preparations for prosthetic 
 purposes may influence the cement properties .
knoop hardness number ( standard deviation ) at cervical , middle , occlusal thirds 
 and occlusal surface according to the conditions substrate / time storage n=5 specimens in each group .
hardness values were significantly lower when crowns were cemented on 
 resin cores and measured after 7 days of storage ( p=0.007 ) ( table 2 , figure 4 ) .
