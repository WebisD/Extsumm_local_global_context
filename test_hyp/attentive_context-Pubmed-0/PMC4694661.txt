unlike many published descriptions of ultrasound - guided pvb , in which the operator approaches the pvb space in - plane to the ultrasound beam with the probe held in a transverse mediolateral fashion , we utilize an  out - of - plane  approach with the ultrasound probe in a parasagittal plane combined with intermittent low - volume hydrodissection to guide needle advancement . the aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the preoperative pvbs provided for patients undergoing vats .
in summary , the current study presents data suggesting that ultrasound - guided paravertebral blockade using an out - of - plane needle approach may offer a number of clinical benefits to patients undergoing vats procedures .
paravertebral blocks ( pvbs ) are a validated method of limiting postoperative pain for patients undergoing vats and other thoracic procedures.1117 our institution began providing ultrasound - guided pvbs for patients undergoing vats in the spring of 2011 with positive feedback from both patients and surgeons .
the findings of this study support the assertion that preoperative pvbs performed with an out - of - plane needle insertion technique improve analgesic outcomes in the immediate postoperative period and improve the quality of the anesthetic . specifically , our patients had lower reported pain scores , lower perioperative opioid requirements , fewer incidences of treated postoperative nausea or vomiting , and shorter stays in the pacu .
