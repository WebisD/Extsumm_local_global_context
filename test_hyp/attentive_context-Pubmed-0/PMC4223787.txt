corroborating the first hypothesis of the present study , both the dual - cure resin 
 cements tested in vitro produced a more continuous interface than the 
 self - adhesive maxcem , which formed a discontinuous interface with many gaps .
maxcem elite does not produce a satisfactory cementation ( only 47% 
 interfacial continuity ) ; 2 - cementation quality provided by the different cement types is similar among the 
 cervical , medium and apical portions of the tooth roots ; 3 - in practical terms , relyx u100 provides the best cementation because combines good 
 cementation and easy application ; 4- because the cements tested do not provide a complete interfacial continuity , we 
 suggest the development of novel materials using low - shrinking resin composites that are 
 already used for restoration purposes .
because geometry and environmental conditions are quite irregular along the root 
 portions , we tested a second hypothesis that the interfacial continuity formed is 
 different in the cervical , medium and apical portions of the root .
based on the results of this in vitro study , we conclude that : 1 - the cements allcem , relyx arc and relyx u100 provide good cementation with 80% 
 continuity .
