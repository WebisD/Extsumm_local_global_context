the bacterial diversity of the predominant oral microbiota associated with development of cariogenic lesions was determined using homim in an in vivo model .
the results clearly showed an ecological shift in dental plaque over developing wsls in enamel .
consequently , we compared the changes in microbiota on pairs of samples between baseline and for those samples that did not develop a lesion .
some of these were associated with the increasing severity of wsls such as s. wiggsiae , s. salivarius and v. atypica and might play important roles in the process of caries development .
our results indicate that the microbiota on intact enamel was significantly different from that of the microbiota associated with wsls developed for seven weeks under protected metal bands .
the in vivo model of microbial community succession provided novel insights into the microbial community shifts associated with the development of wsls , and likely dental caries .
comparison of statistically significant bacterial taxa associated with carious lesions in the secondary dentition many of the bacterial species found to be increased in plaque covering sound enamel and in plaque behind the plaque retaining bands are capable of producing acid .
consequently , the bacterial community composition associated with the progression of wsl is specific and much more complex than previously believed and should be explored in future studies .
