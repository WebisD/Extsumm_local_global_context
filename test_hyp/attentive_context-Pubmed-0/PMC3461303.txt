in the field of cancer prevention , the idea of producing the so called  magic - bullet ,  as conceived by paul ehelich for antibacterials , too easily evokes the long - life elixir on a molecular level capturing the imagination of both the public and researchers . from the standpoint of cancer research policy , the possible role of single dietary constituents is of pivotal interest in cancer research but basic information about the role of metabolizing apparatus
the ongoing scientific controversy surrounding the effects of single molecules on cancer risk seems to provide a salutary warning for health policymakers . considering that unhealthy lifestyle factors are also taken into account ,
strategies for cancer prevention necessarily focus on eliminating unhealthy lifestyle habits such as alcoholism or cigarette smoking or improving both diet and exercise patterns which are believed to contribute to about one - third of annual cancer deaths worldwide   . over the last decades , accumulating epidemiological evidence and animal investigations have suggested that consumption of a diet rich in food plants significantly reduces the risk of several types of cancers and recent recommendations point to plant - based diets   .
we must remember here that these strategies were extrapolated from epidemiological observations on populations consuming diets varying in both quantity and type of food plant containing thousands of chemical agents which are able to modulate the specific activity of the metabolizing enzyme battery in a very complex way .
