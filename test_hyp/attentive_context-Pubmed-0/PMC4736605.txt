the low incidence of ac in infants is unexpected but may be related to differences in coding in this age group . in addition , this large study did not identify any in - hospital ac related deaths in this child / adolescent population without screening .
differences in detection , morbidity at presentation ( particularly the likelihood of presentation with an ac ) , and mortality risk between male and female infants with cah have been identified in a number of incidence studies   .
the results of the present study , which covered thirteen years of admissions to both private and public hospitals in a large geographic area for medical treatment of children with cah , demonstrated that infants had the highest admission rate among the age groups ; episodes of hospitalisation decreased with increasing age ; 6.5% of the admissions included a record of an ac but if all cases of admission for hypoadrenalism were included , almost 50% were due to some degree of ai ; there was a lessening of the risk of ac beyond age of five ; comorbid viral infections were more common than bacterial infections ; and there were no in - hospital deaths . among all the cah
