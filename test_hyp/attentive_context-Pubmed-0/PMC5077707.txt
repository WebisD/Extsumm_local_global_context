we found no significant differences between the osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic groups with regard to sex ( p  =  0.28 ) , body mass index ( 27.6 versus 29.9 , p  =  0.12 ) , number of identified medical comorbidities ( 2.3 versus 1.8 , p  =  0.15 ) , total number of vertebral levels fused ( 1.9 versus 1.8 , p  =  0.56 ) , or fusion rate ( 83.3 versus 88.6% , p  =  0.56 ) .
there were no statistically significant differences between groups for gross implant migration in the coronal or sagittal planes ( 11.1 versus 1.4% , p  =  0.11 ) , pedicle screw loosening ( 22.2 versus 8.6% , p  =  0.14 ) , revision surgery ( 16.6 versus 14.3% , p  =  0.78 ) , or postoperative symptoms ( 44.4 versus 50.0% , p  =  0.69 ; tables 1 , 2 ) .
in conclusion , we found significantly increased rates of cage subsidence , iatrogenic fractures , and overall radiographic complications in patients with osteoporosis undergoing tlif .
therefore , we sought to compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes of tlif in patients with and patients without osteoporosis .
there were no statistically significant differences between the osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic groups in persistent or recurrent symptoms , though the rate of recurrence in the nonosteoporotic group was three times higher ( persistent symptoms : 38.9 versus 30.0% , p  =  0.47 , respectively ; recurrent symptoms : 5.6 versus 18.6% , p  =  0.18 , respectively ) . abbreviations :
