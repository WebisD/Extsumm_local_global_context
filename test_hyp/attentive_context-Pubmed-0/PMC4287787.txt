the objective of this retrospective study , in men with gd , was to compare the efficacy of fixed doses of radioiodine between patients with and without long - term cmz pretreatment .
the rate of hypothyroidism between 6 months and 1-year after i therapy was not significantly different between the two groups ( 12.2% vs. 16.9% , p = 0.2 ) .
the rate of hypothyroidism within the first 6 months after i therapy was significantly higher in patients without pretreatment ( 55.1% vs. 44.6% , p = 0.05 ) .
the success rate of a single dose of i was significantly higher in patients without pretreatment than in patients who were pretreated with cmz ( 91.4% vs. 82.3% , p = 0.01 ) [ figure 1 ] .
men with gd have a lower rate of remission compared to women and the impact of long - term pretreatment with atd on the efficacy of radioiodine treatment in men has not been adequately evaluated .
male patients with graves hyperthyroidism pretreated with cmz have lower efficacy with i therapy compared to nonpretreated patients .
