this study aimed at comparing the outcomes of specific supervised strength training of shoulder muscles with the outcomes of counseling ( defined patient education programs ) for girls with tth .
shoulder muscle pain.11 physical exercise for children has not yet been examined , although the world health organization published global recommendations on physical activity for health in 2011 specifically for children aged 517.12 in one of our previous studies , we found reduced neck  shoulder muscle strength and aerobic power together with increased pericranial tenderness , especially in the trapezius descendens , to be associated with tth in girls.13 we hypothesized that strengthening the shoulder muscles would result in reduced headache frequency and improvements in the girl s physical capabilities .
the participants in this study reported deficits at baseline in hrqol in physical , emotional , and school functioning areas , with school functioning obtaining the lowest score .
both educating girls with tth in a moderate strength training program for a period of 10 weeks and doing need - based motivational counseling for lifestyle changes have a significant effect on headache frequency and duration with no significant between - group difference .
the odds of having headache on a random day decreased for group a during 10 weeks of intervention by 0.68 ( 0.470.99 ) ( or [ 95% ci ] ) and by 0.64 ( 0.440.93 ) after 12 weeks of home practice . for group b , the odds decreased by 0.62 ( 0.440.89 ) ( or [ 95% ci ] ) during 10 weeks of intervention and by 0.66 ( 0.450.95 ) after 12 weeks of home practice .
