, researchers can avoid manual coding between formats and can easily construct workflows for data analysis . additionally , accessory tools in snptransformer perform data previewing , relational operations on ids , recoding data files and simulating map files that assist data conversion and gwas analysis .
the major aim of snptransformer is to convert genotyping input ( such as linkage and chip formats ) into various outputs ( such as packages for association , tdt , calculating ld measures , haplotype inference , haplotype block partition , tagsnps and multilocus interaction ) . with this toolkit
broad application of the whole - genome single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) chips into genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) has also led to the discovery of more than 100 loci for nearly 40 common diseases and traits ( 9 ) . due to the great challenges presented by huge datasets ,
furthermore , output formats are limited to haploview , snphap , phase and pedphase . however , as classic programs implement specific algorithms for genetic analysis and provide an option for analysis of gwas data , it is important to develop a tool to bridge these programs with raw genotyping data . here , we present a powerful , user - friendly , lightweight toolkit named snptransformer for gwas .
