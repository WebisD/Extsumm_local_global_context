the results of our study suggested that the il-6 secretion level may be enhanced to some extent by the induction of aplastic anemia caused by irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs and that the abnormal level of il-6 might probably interfere with the stability of the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment .
supposed that the change of il-6 level in aplastic anemia patients may be due to an association with inflammatory response , and il-6 may have an effect of immunoregulation and mediate induction in the destruction pathology of bone marrow cells , but the concrete mechanism still needs to be elucidated . in our study , we noticed that in the anemia group , with the increase of il-6 level , the proliferation of the bmsc was obviously impeded .
the apoptosis rate of bmc from the aplastic anemia group ( 9.75  2.43% ) was significantly higher than that of normal controls ( 3.63  1.06% ; figure 4 ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
of all the cytokines , il-6 is the first one found to be associated with the pathogenesis of the disease , due to its close relation with a variety of diseases under overexpression .   in the present study , a mouse model of aplastic anemia
