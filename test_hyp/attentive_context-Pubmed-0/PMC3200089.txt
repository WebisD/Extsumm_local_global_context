the bipolar technique was the form of coagulation with the highest efficiency and the least tissue damage .
the experimental study showed differences between several coagulation techniques in a minimally invasive model for hemostasis in deep liver bleeding .
the tests were performed on perfused , isolated pig liver in a minimally invasive model with a pulsatile organ perfusion ( p.o.p . ) trainer . for analysis
sutton   et al . examined the lateral thermal spread using monopolar and bipolar diathermy , the harmonic scalpel and ligasure by measuring the maximum temperature . in our present study
ultrasonic coagulation , which is very useful in dissection of tissue and coagulation of isolated vessels , did not lead to a sufficient hemostasis in large bleeding areas .
klingele compared the ultrasonic technique with the bipolar technique in dissected vessels and examined the tissue damage .
a complete laparoscopic equipment setup for minimally invasive surgery was used together with a p.o.p .
underwood et al . measured the differences in operative time , blood loss and complications when using bipolar or ultrasonic technique in colectomies and fundoplications   .
perfusion of the isolated liver was achieved with colored saline solution and not with blood , what restricts hemostasis and prolongs the coagulation time .
