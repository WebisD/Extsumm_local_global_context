we found that the changed concentration of cys c is superior to scr as a biomarker in the early detection of cin .
most importantly , external factors have little effect on the serum level of cys c. previous studies have demonstrated its utility in detection of diabetic mellitus and hypertensive nephropathy . in the present study we sought to determine the ability of cys c to predict the occurrence of cin in patients who underwent cag and intervention , and we compared the sensitivity and specificity of cystatin c and serum creatinine in the diagnosis of cin .
a total of 300 patients ( 179 males , 121 females ) with a mean age of 63.479.92 were included in the final study . according to the definition of cin , patients with a > 25% relative increase of serum creatinine , or an increase in concentration of serum creatinine of at least by 44 mmol / l from the baseline 48 h after cag ,
in conclusion , our study demonstrated that the change in concentration of cys c is superior to scr as a biomarker in the early detection of cin .
when we chose the serum level of creatinine at 24 h for roc analysis , the auc was 0.733 ( 95% ci : 0.6400.825 , p<0.001 ) and the optimum cut - off level was 73.55
