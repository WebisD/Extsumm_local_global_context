here we reported the effects of folic acid on lps - induced inflammatory responses of bv-2 microglia cells .
the modulation of signaling pathways may also be related both to a potent inhibitory effect of folic acid on the expression of inos , as well as of no , il-1 , and tnf- production induced by lps , and to an upregulating action on anti - inflammatory cytokine il-10 release in activated microglia .
in this study we show , for the first time , that folic acid pretreatment was able to polarize proinflammatory responses to anti - inflammatory responses in lps - activated microglia cells , blocking the activation of nf-b and jnk and upregulating p38 mapk phosphorylation .
thus , we propose that upregulation of socs1/3 expression by folate may be an integrated part of the regulatory machinery of inflammatory responses in activated microglia and that at least two distinct pathways may lead to this result .
, the cytokine expression levels were analyzed by elisa . as shown in figure 5 , treatment with the p38 pharmacological inhibitor , sb203580 ( 10  m ) , induced a significant decrease of il-10 levels with respect to both lps - stimulated cells in presence of folate and cells treated with folic acid alone , highlighting the important role of p38 kinase in the upregulation of il-10 production by folic acid treatment .
