this series reviews our experience with laparoscopy in the management of vp and lp shunt malfunction in adult patients , as well as diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with indwelling shunts who presented with abdominal pain .
we conducted a retrospective review of all adult patients undergoing laparoscopic revision of vp and lp shunts or diagnostic laparoscopy for assessment of abdominal complaints or shunt function in patients with a vp or lp shunt .
laparoscopy is a safe and effective technique for the management of complications following shunt placement , assessment of shunt function , and diagnosis of abdominal complaints .
our series represents the largest published series of laparoscopic management of shunt complications in adults .
however , experience with laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of shunt malfunction has been limited .
peritoneal drainage of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) is widely used by neurosurgeons to treat hydrocephalus .
data collected include age , sex , diagnoses , indications for surgery , operative details , and short - term results . for initial assessment
shunt dysfunction still occurs in a substantial number of cases , with reported estimates of abdominal complications ranging from 5% to 47% .
comparative studies of minimally invasive shunt placement versus traditional open techniques have suggested laparoscopy is not only a reliable technique , but it has fewer complications as well .
