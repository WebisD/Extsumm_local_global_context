we recommend that clinicians consider performing infrared imaging of the retina when managing a patient who presents with unexplained vision loss after blunt trauma and a normal - appearing fundus .
in this case , there is a clear temporal relationship between eye trauma , transient vision loss , transient oct changes consistent with cr , and transient infrared hypo - reflectance .
a 68-year - old male presented complaining of sudden and profound loss of central vision in his left eye following blunt eye trauma .
cases of cr detectable on oct , but not fundus examination have been described , confirming that some cases of cr are subclinical . to the best of the authors knowledge
the pathology of cr has been studied histologically and on oct , and comprises fragmentation of the photoreceptor os without injury to the inner retina .
as demonstrated by our case , this manifests on 5-line raster oct as abnormal hyper - reflectivity of the os layer .
nevertheless , this case suggests that infrared imaging may have a role as a diagnostic adjunct for detecting subclinical cr .
our case implicates infrared imaging as a diagnostic adjunct for detecting subclinical cr . since focal dark spots on infrared imaging correlated with points of nodular os thickening in our case
