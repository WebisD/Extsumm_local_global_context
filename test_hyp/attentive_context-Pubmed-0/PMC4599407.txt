the joint effect of hypertension and elevated serum phosphorus on the risk of cardiovascular mortality and all - cause mortality was ( hr=2.80 , 95% ci : 2.09 ; 3.73 ) and ( hr=1.76 , 95% ci : 1.49 ; 2.07 ) , respectively . for cardiovascular mortality , interaction was observed between hypertension and elevated serum phosphorus on the additive scale ( reri=0.99 , 95% ci : 0.06 ; 1.92 , adjusted for age , gender , race , and egfr ) , suggesting that the joint effect of hypertension and elevated serum phosphorus is stronger than is the sum of the independent effects of individual risk factor . with respect
adjusted hazard ratios of cardiovascular and all - cause mortality for joint effect of hypertension and elevated serum phosphorus adjusted for age , gender , race , estimated glomerular filtration rate , socioeconomic status , smoking , body mass index , history of cardiovascular disease , diabetes , serum cholesterol , and vitamin d. adjusted for age , gender , race , estimated glomerular filtration rate , and dietary phosphorus intake / day .
reri for cardiovascular mortality was significant ( reri=1.21 , 95% ci : 0.26 ; 2.17 ) and not for all - cause mortality ( reri=0.17 , 95% ci : 0.27 ; 0.62 , adjusted for age , gender , race , and egfr ) .
