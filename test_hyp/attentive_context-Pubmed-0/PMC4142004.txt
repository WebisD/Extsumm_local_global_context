early treatment failure is more likely to be due to adverse effects , so duration of first treatment and reason for first treatment failure are likely to be correlated , but nonetheless , both factors were included in the multivariable model . while broad epilepsy type ( focal vs generalized ) was not included in the multivariable model , this was , in part , accounted for by seizure type ,
similarly , the models may also aid in the identification of patients with poorer seizure control outcomes who might be eligible to participate in future trials of new treatments , for example surgical treatments such as deep brain stimulation , which might carry greater risk than drug treatment .
patients with differing risks of 12 months of remission and treatment failure could be identified at the point in time when the initial aed treatment failed .
the model including patients with a first failure due to inadequate seizure control includes age and ct / mri results , and has a c statistic of 0.6 , suggesting low predictive utility .
results will improve outcome prediction for patients , and allow better stratification of patients , including the identification of patients more likely to have poor treatment outcome for whom more intensive follow - up may be required .
