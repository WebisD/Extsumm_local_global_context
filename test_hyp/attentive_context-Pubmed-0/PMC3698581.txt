both the inorganic ( naf ) and the organic fluoride ( amf ) were effective in remineralization naf remineralization did not restore the hardness of the enamel surface to that of pre - operative levels amf provided greater benefits than naf which was satistically significant the remineralized surface obtained by exposure to amf was found to be harder than intact enamel .
hence , the aim of the present in vitro study was to compare the micro hardness of demineralized enamel after topical application of naf and amf solutions .
the resultant 40 samples were randomly divided into 2 groups - group a ( n = 20 samples ) and group b ( n = 20 samples ) .

the samples treated with naf ( group a ) demonstrated a slight decrease in the mean micro hardness after treatment ( from baseline ) .
