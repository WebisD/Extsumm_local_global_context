when patients present with acute occlusion of either the internal carotid artery ( ica ) or the proximal middle cerebral artery ( mca ) within the therapeutic time window for restoration of cerebral blood flow , rapid recanalization using intravenous / intra - arterial ( ia ) thrombolysis and ia mechanical embolectomy is the goal of acute stroke management.11 ) however , if the patient presents beyond the therapeutic time window , life - threatening brain swelling and herniation , known as malignant mca infarction , can manifest within one week after the onset of stroke symptoms , along with a further decrease of consciousness and pupillary dilatation , necessitating early application of a decompressive hemicraniectomy for achievement of a better clinical outcome.24 ) the present article reviews the pathophysiology , historical background in previous studies , operative timing , surgical technique and clinical outcomes of decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant mca infarction involving the mca territory with or without anterior cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery territories .
in particular , if a decompressive hemicraniectomy is performed early , before irreversible cerebral herniation , using appropriate surgical techniques , favorable outcomes with functional independence can be achieved in a high proportion of patients .
