the annual frequency of drug shortages increased 200% from 2006 to 2010 . furthermore , in 2012 the food and drug administration ( fda ) reported a record number of 251 drugs on shortage .
two adverse events ( a delay in treatment and an inability to treat with other antimicrobials due to resistance ) were attributed to have probable causality due to a shortage , while the remaining adverse events ( death and an inability to tolerate high oral doses ) were attributed to have unlikely and possible causalities due to a shortage , respectively .
the survey was distributed through an editorial in pharmacotherapy , a letter in the american journal of health - system pharmacy , and through the american college of clinical pharmacy ( accp ) infectious diseases practice and research network ( i d prn ) email listserv .
this method is standardized , anonymous , convenient , and capable of de - duplicating responses .
this pilot study has revealed unique instances of patient harm with assessed causality attributed to antimicrobial shortages .
clinicians were asked anonymously to report occurrences of patient harm related to antimicrobial drug shortages through an online survey ( surveymonkey ; surveymonkey , palo alto , ca , usa ) consisting of 11 questions ( table  1 ) .
