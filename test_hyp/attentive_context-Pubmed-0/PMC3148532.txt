we report on the mammographic and sonographic imaging and pathological findings of a low grade , primary breast fibrosarcoma .
reports in the medical literature with the radiologic imaging of primary breast fibrosarcomas are also very rare . to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior report of the sonographic imaging of primary fibrosarcoma of the breast in the english medical literature . here
fibrosarcoma of the breast is a rare tumor and the imaging results make it difficult to differentiate this type of lesion from other malignant masses .
a 47-year - old woman presented with a painless palpable mass in her left breast .
fibrosarcoma of the breast is included in this group of sarcomas and this tumor is always malignant , although the malignancy may vary in degree .
primary breast fibrosarcoma is a rare neoplasm . in a review of the literature , barnes and pietruszka   reviewed all the cases of breast sarcoma that were seen at the health center hospitals of the university of pittsburgh during the 1945 - 1976 period , and they found that only 10 cases of primary breast sarcoma had been reported .
we therefore classified the mass as category 4b according to the breast imaging reporting and data system ( bi - rads ) .
