therefore , the second aim of the present study was to explore the role of weight status in the relationship between the various sedentary behaviors and mental health .
the results of this explorative study showed no association between time spent sitting during transport or sitting at work and mental health . only sitting during leisure time and in particular the amount of time viewing tv
associations were even more complicated , because both work status and weight status are effect modifiers in these associations . among nonworking persons , the total time spent sitting , the time spent sitting during leisure , and particularly viewing tv , was associated with a poorer mental health in those with a healthy weight only . in workers ,
, there was a significant negative interaction with bmi for the working population ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . among workers , the time spent sitting in leisure , and particularly the time spent viewing tv , was negatively associated with mental health , both with and without adjustment for bmi ( 0.11 , 95% ci ( 0.21)(0.002 ) for total leisure time , and  0.18 , 95% ci ( 0.35)(0.01 ) for tv viewing time , resp . ) . among the nonworking population ,
