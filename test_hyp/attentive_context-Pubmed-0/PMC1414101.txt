the ap-2 family of transcription factors ( ensembl family ensf00000001105 ) consists in humans and mice of five members , ap-2 , ap-2 , ap-2 , ap-2 and ap-2 ; frogs and fish have some of these proteins , and homologs are also known in invertebrates . the chromosomal locations and accession numbers of the family
the single xenopus ap-2 is most closely related to mammalian ap-2 proteins . as the genes ap-2 and ap-2 are found on the same chromosome in chickens , rodents and humans ( table 1 )
complementary approaches currently include the identification of ap-2 target genes ; this might give a better understanding of developmental disturbances and pave the way to novel treatment options . at the molecular level , one major challenge will be the identification of specific ap-2 homo- or hetero - dimeric complexes bound to a particular promoter and the identification of the specific properties of each complex with respect to gene regulation . also , the signaling pathways responsible for induction of ap-2 genes are currently under investigation
this hypothesis is further supported by the conserved epithelial expression patterns of murine ap-2 , xenopus ap-2   and the amphioxus and lamprey ap-2 genes . as expected ,
