a shorter arousal time from sedation during spinal anaesthesia can be achieved using propofol compared with midazolam while monitoring the depth of sedation with bis monitor .
similar findings were evident when clinical sedation score was analysed and both the monitoring systems were found to correlate strongly during the recovery from sedation .
the point of recovery , the number of patients with oaa / s score of 4 were 13 ( in group p ) and 12 ( in group m ) respectively , and those with oaa
in the present study , the time to reach bis score of 90 ( arousal time from sedation ) was lower with injection propofol than midazolam ( 7.54  3.70 min and 15.54  6.93 min , respectively ) .
group p -patients receiving injection propofol ; group m patients receiving injection midazolam the arousal time from sedation was significantly lower for the group p when compared to group m ( p = 0.000 ) ; the time taken to reach an oaa / s score of 5 was also found to be lower for group p ( p = 0.000 ) as cited in table 2 .
similarly , the patients became clinically awake ( time taken to reach an oaa / s score of 5 ) earlier when sedated with propofol ( 6.81  2.54 min with propofol vs. 13.51  6.24 min with midazolam ) .
