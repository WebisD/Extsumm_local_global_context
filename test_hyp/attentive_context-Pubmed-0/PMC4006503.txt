in conclusion development of pneumothorax in the neonatal period carries high risk of mortality especially in low birth weight and premature infants .
this retrospective cohort study was performed on 60 newborns presenting with pneumothorax among 5929 infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit ( nicu ) from january 2007 to april 2011 .
therefore we aimed to investigate whether assessment of pneumothorax size on chest x - ray may be a predictor of prognosis in newborns .
pneumothorax size was significantly higher in non - survivors ( 31.12.8 vs. 16.41.4 , p<0.001 ) and also in patients treated with a chest tube ( 25.81.9 vs. 14.22.0 , p<0.001 ) .
statistical analysis of significance in predicting mortality data are presented as mean ( standard deviation ) the confounding factors including early gestational age , low birth weight , resuscitation at birth , mechanical ventilation and need for chest tube were of great significance in predicting mortality .
in the present study we aimed to evaluate significance of pneumothorax size in predicting the mortality of newborns . the development of a pneumothorax with ensuing hypoxia and hypercapnia is a potentially life - threatening condition and 30% of the infants in the present study died in nicu .
