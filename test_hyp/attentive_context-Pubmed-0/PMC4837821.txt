however , in view of widely reported benefit of higher patency rate associated with sequential vein bypass grafting , we recommended the use of sequential vein bypass grafting when feasible .
no significant differences was present in in - hospital composite endpoints , with 14 ( 11.0% ) total events in individual venous grafts group versus 18 ( 14.2% ) in sequential venous grafts group ( p = 0.45 ) .
also , there were no significant differences between individual venous grafts and sequential venous grafts group with regard to the individual outcome of in - hospital mortality ( 0.8% vs. 0.0% , p = 1.00 ) , mi ( 0.8% vs. 0.8% , p = 1.00 ) , stroke ( 0.8% vs. 0.8% , p = 1.00 ) , iabp assistance ( 0.0% vs. 0.8% , p = 1.00 ) and prolonged ventilations ( 10.2% vs. 13.4% , p = 0.44 ) . in - hospital outcomes of propensity - matched patients based on sequential venous grafts iabp : intra - aortic ballon pump .
the present study suggests that sequential vein bypass grafting technique was not independently associated with increased risk of composite or individual outcomes of in - hospital mortality , mi , stroke , iabp assistance and prolonged ventilation in patients undergoing off - pump cabg .
