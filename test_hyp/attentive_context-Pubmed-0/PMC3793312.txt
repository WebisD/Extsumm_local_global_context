the present study reports for the first time that mia activation by poly(i : c ) at early gestation , which can lead to impairments in multiple psychological domains , is associated with mitochondrial changes in immune the cells of adult offspring .
the aim of this study was to evaluate mitochondrial function in splenocytes from offspring gestationally exposed to an acute viral mimetic , that is , poly(i : c ) , to induce mia .
, we sought to determine whether mia in pregnant dams alters mitochondrial function in splenocytes from affected offspring . to test this ,
trophoblasts , which express tlr3 , play a role in coordinating the maternal innate immune response to infection at the fetomaternal interface   and , especially in this case , in response to viral infection .
in particular , the proinflammatory cytokine il-6 has been proved to be a key intermediary in the behavioral changes observed in the offspring of dams treated with poly(i : c ) . moreover , blocking il-6 with antibodies prevents behavioral changes in the offspring , and poly(i : c)-induced mia in il-6 ko does not result in behavioral changes in the offspring .
these results beget the question , what is the link between lower complex i activity ( or lower oxidative phosphorylation ) in the offspring and an acute maternal immune response ? a growing body of evidence is placing mitochondria at the center of bioenergetics and immune response / inflammation .
