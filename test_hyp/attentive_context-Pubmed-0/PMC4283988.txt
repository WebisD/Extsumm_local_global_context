more than 170 million persons worldwide are infected with the hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) , and the number of deaths caused by hcv - related liver diseases is more than 35 thousand per year.1 in addition , hcv infection is associated with an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.2 to reduce the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and hcv - related liver diseases , a treatment based on interferon ( ifn ) is commonly used for patients with chronic hepatitis c.3 two types of pegylated interferon ( peg - ifns ) ( alfa-2a and alfa-2b ) are used , which are pegylated to improve their pharmacokinetic effects and pharmacodynamic actions , and which have a higher rate of sustained virologic response ( svr ) and lower frequency of incidence of adverse reactions than ifn.4 thus far , the general recommendation for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis c involves combination therapy with peg - ifn ( alfa-2a or alfa-2b ) and ribavirin ( rbv).3 however , previous studies that have compared the effectiveness and safety of treatment with peg - ifn alfa-2a and alfa-2b for patients with chronic hepatitis c have yielded conflicting results.58 the largest randomized controlled trial ( rct ) to date was a comparison in 2009 of svr and safety in the treatment of 3,070 patients with chronic hcv genotype 1 among three groups ( low - dose peg - ifn alfa-2b plus rbv ; standard - dose peg - ifn alfa-2b plus rbv ; and peg - ifn alfa-2a plus rbv).9 that study excluded patients with hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) or human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection , as well as other liver diseases , and found that the rates of svr and adverse event profiles among the three groups were similar . on the other hand , some meta - analyses of rcts comparing peg - ifn alfa-2a and alfa-2b suggested a higher svr rate in the alfa-2a group than in the alfa-2b group.5,6 however , several limitations involving the study quality were pointed out , including a small sample size as well as inadequate blinding and randomization.5 a large retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare the svr rate obtained with peg - ifn alfa-2a and alfa-2b for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis c in germany.10 a total of 3,414 patients were identified as a study cohort from the database . this study allowed the inclusion of patients who had a comorbid hbv or hiv infection and any hcv genotype , and used matched pair analysis , using the baseline patient characteristics to compare the rates of svr with peg - ifn alfa-2a and alfa-2b . although a higher svr rate was found for alfa-2a than for alfa-2b ,
