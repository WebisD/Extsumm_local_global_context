we present our initial experience using evas in the treatment of patients with a ruptured infrarenal aneurysm .
endovascular aneurysm sealing appears feasible for the management of ruptured aneurysms , with acceptable short - term outcome , albeit in a small series of patients .
the application of evas devices for ruptured aneurysm repair may broaden the selection criteria of the current endovascular strategy to include patients with complex aneurysm morphology .
prior to december 2013 , 50 patients with aaa were treated with nellix in an elective setting at our institute .
is durability , and longer follow - up is needed in a cohort of patients treated with evas to compare this modality with existing endovascular techniques .
although endovascular aneurysm repair ( evar ) of intact infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms ( aaa ) has been associated with a reduction in early mortality and morbidity as compared with open repair , the benefits of an endovascular strategy do not appear to translate to the treatment of ruptured aneurysms .
median follow - up of surviving patients was 9.3 months ; at 3 and 6 months , all 3 devices were patent on duplex ultrasound and cta , with no evidence of endoleak or insufficient aneurysm sac sealing among the survivors .
